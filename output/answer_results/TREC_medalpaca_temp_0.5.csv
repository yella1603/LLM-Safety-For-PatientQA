"There are more than 20 different types of migraine.
  Most patients have migraine with aura, menstrual, or migraine without aura.
  There are less common types such as chronic, hemiplegic, retinal, ophthalmoplegic, and familial hemiplegic.
There are also different types of migraine based on the duration of the attacks such as acute, chronic, and episodic.

As you can see there are too many types of migraine, so researchers usually study the most common types of migraine such as migraine with aura and migraine without aura.

You can read more about the types of migraine here.




Has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types?


There are many studies about the types of treatment that are effective for migraine.
For example, you can read about the effectiveness of amitriptyline for migraine here.
There are many other studies about the effectiveness of other types of treatment such as NSAIDs, triptans, dihydroergotamine, and botulinum toxin.
You can find all these studies by doing an internet search.
I wish you all the best.","There are no studies that have investigated which migraine treatments are most effective for specific migraine conditions. However, there are studies that have shown that diet and lifestyle changes can be effective for certain types of migraines. For example, one study showed that eliminating foods like cheese, chocolate, aspartame, caffeine, and nitrates reduced the frequency of migraines by 66%. In another study, 72% of participants who practiced regular aerobic exercise reported a reduction in migraines. Other studies have shown that reducing stress, getting regular sleep, and avoiding triggers can also be effective for migraine prevention. It is important to work closely with your doctor to determine the best treatment plan for your specific type of migraine.","Yes. There have been numerous studies examining the efficacy of treatment for migraine. Based on the international classification of headache disorders (ICHD), there are 4 types of migraine: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, migraine during pregnancy and menstrual related migraine. There is evidence to support treatment of each of these types of migraine. For example, for migraine without aura, triptans are often used for abortive therapy while ergots are used for prophylactic therapy. For migraine with aura, ergots are used for abortive therapy and beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and TCAs are used for prophylactic therapy. For menstrual related migraine, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are often used for abortive and prophylactic therapy. It is important to note that treatment should be individualized based on the patient's specific type of migraine, frequency and severity of attacks, medication history and comorbidities.","While there is evidence to suggest that some medications are more effective for certain types of migraines, there is no research to date that has proven subtype specific effectiveness for migraine medications.

It is true that ergotamine derivatives such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are most effective for migraines with aura, and that triptans are most effective for migraines without aura (and are also effective for migraines with aura), and that beta-blockers are most effective for migraines that are chronic and severe, but these effects are based on studies that compared the effectiveness of medications for migraine treatment overall, and observed the subtype distribution among the patients who responded to treatment.

For example, in a study of 25 different medications for migraine treatment, researchers found that triptans were the most effective overall, with topiramate being the second most effective. When looking at patients who got at least 50% relief of their pain, however, ergotamine derivatives were the most effective overall, with topiramate and dihydroergotamine being second and third, respectively.

Overall, then, medications for migraine treatment can be said to be more effective for some types of migraines than others, but there is no research to date that has proven subtype specific effectiveness.

It's important to note that lifestyle changes and avoiding triggers can also be very effective for migraine prevention and treatment, and that medications should be used in conjunction with these strategies when possible.","Yes. Check the link below:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3541306/","Yes, there is evidence that links specific migraine treatments to their effectiveness against distinct migraine conditions.

Different types of migraines respond differently to treatment. For example, ergots are effective for treating migraines with aura, while triptans are effective for treating migraines without aura. Dihydroergotamine is effective for treating migraines that are resistant to other treatments.

It's important to note that not all migraines can be cured with medication. Lifestyle changes, such as managing stress, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy diet, can also help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines."

The chemotherapy Chat Doctor.  It is a toxic medication that is used to kill cancer cells.  The cramping may be from the chemotherapy. There are different types of chemotherapy,The trigger for cramps in lymphoma patients after chemotherapy is hypercalcemia.,"As a general rule, chemotherapy can cause a range of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and increased risk of infection. However, it's not possible to predict with certainty which particular side effects a given patient will experience as a result of undergoing chemotherapy. The severity of side effects can also vary widely from patient to patient.  Some patients may experience few or no side effects at all.

Cramps are not among the most common side effects of chemotherapy, but they are possible. If a patient experiences cramps during chemotherapy, it's likely that the cramps are related to the chemotherapy drugs themselves rather than the lymphoma. 

It's always a good idea for patients to discuss any concerns or symptoms they may have with their doctor. The doctor may be able to provide additional information or suggest strategies for managing any side effects the patient experiences.",The underlying cause of muscle cramps in people with lymphoma who have undergone chemotherapy is muscle degeneration and weakness.,"Chemotherapy treatments for lymphoma can indeed cause muscle cramps, although this is not always the case.

Some chemotherapy drugs can cause muscle weakness or pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, and other side effects. However, doctors and nurses administering chemotherapy carefully monitor patients for any signs of adverse reactions, and can take steps to mitigate or avoid these side effects when possible. It is important for patients to discuss any concerns or symptoms with their healthcare provider, who can provide individualized care and help ensure the best possible outcome.","As per the information provided, people with lymphoma often experience muscle cramps after receiving chemotherapy.

Macular degeneration research is an active area of investigation. Following are some of the latest developments in macular degeneration research and testing:

- New treatments: New treatments for macular degeneration, such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy, are still in the research and development stage. However, these treatments may become a reality in the future and offer new hope for people with macular degeneration.

- New tests: New tests, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), which uses light to produce cross-sectional images of the retina, have been developed to help detect and monitor macular degeneration and other eye diseases.

- Genetic testing: Genetic testing for macular degeneration is still in the research and development stage. However, in the future, it may be possible to use genetic testing to identify people at risk for macular degeneration and to develop personalized treatment plans.

- Stem cell therapy: Stem cell therapy is still in the research and development stage for treating macular degeneration. However, this new approach may one day make it possible to replace damaged retinal cells and improve vision for people with macular degeneration.

2. Can I participate?

Yes. You may be able to participate in clinical trials for new treatments for macular degeneration. Clinical trials are research studies that involve people. They are designed to find out whether new treatments are safe and effective. Without volunteers, new treatments cannot be developed.

Before participating in a clinical trial, talk with your doctor about why the study is being done and what is known about the new treatment. Ask about possible risks and benefits. Be sure that you understand what will be expected of you if you participate. You will be asked to sign a consent form that states you have been informed of all risks and potential benefits of participation. You may leave a clinical trial at any time, for any reason.

The National Eye Institute (NEI) supports research into the causes and prevention of vision loss with the ultimate goal of finding a cure for blindness. NEI-supported research has led to new therapies, such as laser treatment of retinal tears and photodynamic therapy for certain cancers and skin conditions. For example, clinical trials are testing a new drug that may protect against macular degeneration. This drug, called a monoclonal antibody called bevacizumab (Avastin), is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and is already approved to treat colorectal cancer.

Another area of research involves learning more about the changes in the retina that cause people to lose vision to macular degeneration. Scientists are looking for ways to prevent or reverse these changes. Another goal is to develop ways to detect macular degeneration before it causes any vision loss.

For example, researchers are studying the effects of nutrition on macular degeneration. They are looking at how nutrients, such as antioxidants (especially vitamins C and E), beta-carotene, and omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish oil) may help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and slow its progression.

Other research focuses on identifying genes that cause macular degeneration and learning more about the genes that make someone more likely to develop the disease. Scientists hope this information will one day lead to ways to prevent or treat macular degeneration.

Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located in the neck, and it produces hormones that control body growth and metabolism. When the thyroid is underactive, it means that the body's metabolism slows down.

The most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroid disease. In this condition, the immune system makes antibodies against the thyroid gland. This abnormal immune response causes inflammation of the thyroid gland. The inflammation may damage the thyroid gland and reduce its ability to produce hormone.

As the thyroid gland produces less hormone, the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood increases. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland. This increase in TSH is an indicator of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism can cause a number of symptoms. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include:

Fatigue Weight gain Puffy face Cold intolerance Joint and muscle pain Constipation Dry skin Bradycardia Depression Irregular menstrual periods in women Infertility","1. Goiter: Enlargement of the thyroid gland.
2. Hyperthyroidism: This is the clinical syndrome caused by an excess of circulating free thyroxine (T4) in the blood.
3. Hypothyroidism: It is the clinical syndrome caused by a deficiency of circulating free thyroxine (T4) in the blood.
4. Thyrotoxicosis: It is the clinical syndrome caused by an excess of circulating thyroxine (T4) in the blood, resulting in an excessive production of thyroid hormones.
5. Thyroid nodules: These are the abnormal growths of thyroid tissue within the thyroid gland.
6. Thyroiditis: It refers to the inflammation of thyroid gland.
7. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis or De Quervain's thyroiditis: It is the thyroiditis of intermediate course.
8. Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic granulomatous thyroiditis: It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.
9. Postpartum or nephrogenic thyroiditis: It is the self limiting course of hypothyroidism.
10. Congenital hypothyroidism: It is the hypothyroidism present at birth.
11. Primary hypothyroidism or primary thyroid deficiency: It is the defective function of thyroid gland itself.
12. Secondary hypothyroidism or secondary thyroid deficiency: It is the defective production of thyroid hormones by the pituitary gland.

While individuals with congenital night blindness can take steps to improve their vision, such as avoiding glare and increasing lighting in dim areas, the condition is typically lifelong.","1. Introduction

Congenital night blindness (CNB) is a rare disorder that affects the retina in the eye. It is caused by a genetic defect and is characterised by a reduced ability to see in low light conditions. People with CNB may find it difficult to see in dimly-lit rooms, or outside at night-time, and may experience some vision loss in these conditions. However, individuals with CNB typically have normal vision in good lighting conditions.

2. When do people usually realize they have congenital night blindness?

Most people with CNB realize they have the condition as children, as it develops in infancy or early childhood. This is because the condition tends to be noticeable at a young age, as it affects the ability of the eyes to adjust to low light conditions. Children with CNB may find it difficult to see at night-time or in dark rooms, and may struggle with activities that require good vision in low light, such as reading or playing games.

3. What triggers the realization that someone has congenital night blindness?

The realization that someone has CNB is typically triggered by the observation of symptoms in low light conditions. As CNB affects the ability of the eyes to adjust to low light conditions, symptoms such as difficulty seeing in the dark or in dimly-lit rooms are often the first indication that someone has the condition. This can lead to a visit to the optometrist or ophthalmologist, who may diagnose CNB through an eye exam and discussion of the patient's symptoms and family history.","Key indicators of congenital night blindness include decreased vision in dim lighting conditions, which becomes noticeable at an early age."
"Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that results from the buildup of Lewy bodies, abnormal protein deposits, in the brain. There are two types of Lewy body dementia: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Symptoms of Lewy body dementia include memory problems, difficulty with tasks that require concentration, visual hallucinations, and movement disorders such as tremors and rigidity. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia, but there are treatments that can help manage symptoms. It is important for individuals with Lewy body dementia to receive an accurate diagnosis so that they can access appropriate medical care and support.","Sure.  Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the neurons of the brain.  The condition can cause a range of symptoms, including cognitive and motor impairment, as well as visual hallucinations.  People with Lewy body dementia may also experience fluctuations in attention, mood, and behavior.  Common symptoms include: - difficulty with thinking and remembering- movement problems, such as tremors and rigidity- changes in behavior and mood- hallucinations- delusions- sleep problems  The exact cause of Lewy body dementia is not known.  However, researchers believe that it may be related to changes in the brains structure and chemistry.  Diagnosis of Lewy body dementia can be difficult, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other types of dementia.  However, a thorough medical history, physical exam, neurological evaluation, and brain imaging tests can help with diagnosis.  Treatment for Lewy body dementia may involve medications to manage symptoms, as well as supportive care to maintain quality of life.  It is important for people with Lewy body dementia to receive medical care from a trained healthcare provider who can help manage the condition and provide support to the patient and their caregivers.","-Lewy body dementia is a neurodegenerative brain disease that affects memory, motor control and thinking.  -It's caused by abnormal protein structures in the brain called Lewy bodies, which are found in areas of the brain involved with memory and motor control.  -Symptoms of lewy body dementia can include: Delusions, hallucinations, Parkinson's-like symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, Disorientation, memory loss, and difficulty with thinking and reasoning. -There's currently no cure for Lewy body dementia, but medications may help manage symptoms.","The best way to increase awareness of Lewy Body Dementia is to educate others.

(Simple language)",Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a mutation of the SFAS gene on chromosome 19p13.2. This gene mutation causes a deficiency of three enzymes needed for the breakdown of sulfate rich amino acids. Untreated newborns can develop neurological problems due to the accumulation of these sulfate-rich amino acids. Treatment involves a strict low-sulfate diet and supplementation of the missing enzymes.,"Mutations in the ALAS1, ALAS2, and DHFCS genes cause maple syrup urine disease.


Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes ALAS1, ALAS2, and DHFCS. These genes are responsible for the production of certain proteins involved in the breakdown of certain types of amino acids. Individuals with MSUD have a buildup of these amino acids in their system, which can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, seizures, and developmental delays. MSUD is typically diagnosed shortly after birth through urine and blood tests. Treatment for MSUD involves strict dietary restrictions on the types of amino acids individuals with MSUD can consume, as well as close monitoring of symptoms and regular medical check-ins. With proper treatment, most individuals with MSUD are able to lead relatively healthy and normal lives.","MSUD is caused by mutations in the ALAS1, ALAS2, and DHAD genes that lead to a block in the enzymatic conversion of homogentisic acid to maleylacetoacetate. This can be described in non-technical terms as a ""clogging of the metabolic pipeline"" that normally handles the toxic byproduct homogentisic acid. There are therapeutic approaches for MSUD, such as a low-phenylalanine diet and supplemental vitamin B6, that can help manage the symptoms.","MSUD is usually caused by a mutation in the ALAS1, ALAS2, or DHFC gene.","MSUD is caused by mutations in the ALAS1, ALAS2, and DHAD genes. These mutations result in a deficiency or absence of the enzymes required for tyrosine metabolism. As a result, tyrosine and its metabolites accumulate in the blood and can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing neurological symptoms.


There are two main forms of MSUD: classic and intermittent. Classic MSUD is a severe form of the disorder that affects the metabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Intermittent MSUD is a relatively mild condition that is characterized by the accumulation of tyrosine and its metabolites during periods of physical stress, such as infection or fever.


Treatment options for individuals with MSUD include a low-phenylalanine diet and plasmapheresis. A low-phenylalanine diet involves strictly limiting the intake of phenylalanine and other amino acids that cannot be metabolized by the defective enzymes. Plasmapheresis, which involves the removal and replacement of blood plasma, can be used to rapidly remove tyrosine and its metabolites from the blood. This helps to prevent the accumulation of toxic substances in the brain and improve neurological symptoms. 


It is important to note that while treatments for MSUD can help manage the symptoms of the disorder, they do not cure the underlying genetic mutations that cause the disorder. Further research is needed to develop and implement more effective treatments and potential cures for MSUD."

"1) The condition you describe is the complication of thalassemia called Plummer-Vinson syndrome when the patient is an adult.  Since your friend is having this complication at a young age, it is possible that she has another form of aplastic anemia.  Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow does not make enough blood cells.  Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder in which the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.  The severe form of thalassemia is called beta-thalassemia major (β0/β0).  
Patients with β0/β0 thalassemia major have very small red blood cells (which can cause the blood to be expelled when the patient coughs or sneezes) and enlarged, fatty livers. They often require frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to iron overload and damage to many organs, including the heart. 
Patients with aplastic anemia also have many uncommon features.  These patients often have a fever, are tired, and have a poor appetite. Unlike β0/β0 thalassemia major patients, aplastic anemia patients tests show a low number of white blood cells, a low number of red blood cells and a low amount of platelets. 
The only treatment for β0/β0 thalassemia major is a bone marrow transplant.  Patients with aplastic anemia can be treated with a bone marrow transplant or by removing the patient's white blood cells and giving them chemotherapy.  The goal of treatment is to remove the diseased bone marrow and replace it with healthy bone marrow. 
2) The best place to get treatment for β0/β0 thalassemia major is at a major medical center that performs bone marrow transplants.  These medical centers have teams of doctors who are experts in blood and bone marrow transplants and can guide you through the entire process.

Blue light-emitting devices include televisions, computers, and especially LED screens of all kinds (cell phones, tablets, e-readers). If your father reads in bed, a paper book is highly recommended. 

2. Make sure the room is dark: total darkness is very conducive to sleep. Even the smallest amounts of light can disrupt sleep, so blackout curtains and a good set of eyes will be useful.

3. Keep the temperature comfortable: a cool room is good for sleep, but everyone's different, so your father will have to find what works for him. No need for it to be freezing.

4. Consider soothing sounds: White noise or nature sounds can be very soothing and help block out distracting noises. A small fan heater can provide both white noise and a cool room.

If you have psychogenic DI then you can consume more foods containing sodium.","After removing the pituitary gland at 22 due to birth defect of Diabetes Insipidus, what can be done about the many problems that will surely be faced?","1. Since you were born with DI, you probably have a deficiency of ADH, the hormone that regulates water balance in the body 
2. Since you had your pituitary gland removed, you no longer produce any of your own ADH 
3. Because of 1 and 2, you have to take measures to ensure that you do not become dehydrated, since you will have to pee quite often. 
4. To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, not just water. Have juices, milk, soups, etc. in addition to water. This will ensure that you stay hydrated and your kidneys will be happy. 
5. You will also need to take measures to ensure that you do not become overhydrated. This can happen when you are not peeing much. If you are not peeing much, talk to your doctor right away. 
6. DI can be hereditary. If you have a family history of DI, get tested for it. If you have a child that is diagnosed with DI, get tested for DI. 
7. There are two types of DI - central and nephrogenic. Central means the problem is in the brain, pituitary, etc. Nephrogenic means that the kidneys do not respond to ADH properly. If you have central DI, your child has nephrogenic DI, or you develop nephrogenic DI, treatment with drugs that mimic the effects of ADH can keep you/your child hydrated. 
8. Central DI cannot be treated with drugs that mimic ADH because your body does not produce ADH. There are two options for central DI - get a synthetic ADH pellet implant (lasts about 3-6 years), or get a continuous IV drip of ADH. 
9. For nephrogenic DI, there are drugs that mimic ADH. However, they are not as effective as the real thing, so staying hydrated while taking the drugs is still important. 
10. Lastly, stay positive. There are ways to deal with this condition, so talk to your doctor about what to do if... Then do it.","You should talk to your endocrinologist about possible replacement of hormones. Also, you should monitor your blood sugar frequently. There are different types of DI, so it is important to know which one you have.","1) Water -

As you may know, the pituitary produces ADH (antidiuretic hormone), which helps regulate water balance in the body. Since you were born with diabetes insipidus (DI), which is an absence of ADH, you have likely faced numerous problems related to excessive urination and thirst. Since your pituitary was removed at age 22, you will need to find an alternative solution to manage your DI. One potential solution is a medication called desmopressin, which is an ADH analogue. This medication helps reduce urine output and thirst by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. You may need to work with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and monitor for any side effects. Additionally, you may want to discuss with your healthcare provider the possibility of kidney function tests to assess your kidneys' ability to concentrate urine. 2) Salt -

Since you may be at risk for low blood pressure and other complications related to DI, it is important to consume adequate amounts of salt. This helps replace water lost through urine and maintain blood volume. Healthcare providers often recommend salt supplements or table salt to patients with DI. Additionally, you may want to discuss with your healthcare provider the possibility of monitoring your blood pressure and electrolyte levels over time."

If your father's GIST is completely asymptomatic and small(less than 5cm) then it can be managed with medications.5. The most commonly used kinase inhibitor for GIST is Sunitinib which is a pill. Sometimes Regorafenib another kinase inhibitor is also used in combination.6. The main risk associated with GIST is that it may grow and cause bleeding. If it is interfering with his routine activities then it should be operated.7. So I would suggest you to discuss the option of surgery with your doctor. If it is not growing and causing any problem then medications are a very good option for long term control of GIST.
"3.1. What is the prognosis of SCA3?

Answer: Although scientists have yet to identify the cause of glaucoma, they do know that pressure in the eye is a major risk factor for optic nerve damage.  In the United States, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. It is also the leading cause of blindness in African-Americans.
Research shows that African-Americans are much more likely to suffer from glaucoma than other races. The risk of developing glaucoma increases with age. The chance of developing glaucoma is around 1 in 10 for persons over age 60.
A comprehensive dilated eye exam can help to diagnose glaucoma. It is recommended that persons starting at age 40 receive a comprehensive dilated eye exam every 2 to 4 years.
Regular check-ups are the best way to keep track of the condition of your eyes. A comprehensive dilated eye exam can help to diagnose glaucoma. It is recommended that persons starting at age 40 receive a comprehensive dilated eye exam every 2 to 4 years.
High eye pressure should be treated. Treatment includes medicines in the form of eye drops or ointments which lower eye pressure. Surgery may be needed to treat glaucoma.
People with open angle glaucoma may be treated with topical medications in the form of eye drops. If medication is not effective, a surgical procedure may be needed to make a hole or ""flap"" in the iris in order to allow fluid to escape.
Low eye pressure results when the fluid is able to leave the eye normally. The fluid is still able to nourish the eye and keep it healthy. The goal of treatment is to keep the pressure from going up.
laser surgery
traveling corneal transplant
While glaucoma cannot be completely cured, it can be controlled. This is done by lowering the pressure in the eye. Some people with glaucoma must take medicine every day, while others take medicine only when the disease seems to be getting worse.
Glaucoma is a painless disease. Some people have no symptoms until they develop peripheral vision loss.

"1.  If you have not done so already, please keep a headache diary to help you and your doctors better understand the types of migraines you are experiencing as well as any triggers.  Keeping a diary for at least 4-6 months is recommended.
2.  Speak with your doctor about medication options. There are many different medications for migraines.  Your doctor will work with you to find the best one or combination for your specific type of migraines.
3.  Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, regular sleep patterns, and stress management techniques such as yoga and/or meditation can also help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines.","Preventive treatment for cluster migraine includes the following measures:

Avoid triggers: You can keep a diary to record your headache information, including the time, duration, and intensity of the headache, medications used, and other relevant information such as foods eaten, amount of sleep, and stress levels. By reviewing the diary with your health care provider, you and your doctor can identify triggers and develop a plan to avoid them. Triggers may include stress, lack of sleep, foods, and changes in weather.
Biofeedback: Biofeedback training may help you learn ways to control the activity of your brain.
Calcium: Calcium supplements (four calcium tablets daily) may be recommended to prevent cluster migraines. However, the scientific evidence for the benefit of calcium is weak.
Vitamin B: Vitamin B can be used to prevent cluster migraines. However, the scientific evidence for the benefit of vitamin B is weak.
Medications: Medications used for prevention of cluster migraine include:
Abortive medications: Abortive medications are used to stop a headache once it starts. These medications include:
Diuretics: Diuretics, such as acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be recommended. Ergotamines: Ergotamines, such as ergotamine tartrate and ergotamine sulfate, may be recommended. Ergotamines are given by injection or suppository through the rectum. The pain-relieving effects of ergotamines are relatively quick, but they can have serious side effects, including gangrene (tissue death). Verapamil: Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that is given as an injection at the site of a headache. It may be used if other medications do not work or if the headaches are very severe. Verapamil injections do not work quickly enough to stop the headaches at the early stages.

3) What treatments are available for congenital heart disease?
4) How can congenital heart disease be prevented?
5) What medications are used to treat congenital heart disease?
6) What are the complications of congenital heart disease?","The causes of congenital heart disease are unknown in about half of the cases. Many congenital heart diseases run in families. Some congenital heart diseases are associated with other birth defects. Some occur with pregnancy problems. The mother's health during pregnancy can also affect the baby's heart. Alcohol or illegal drug use during pregnancy can harm the baby's heart. 
Congenital heart diseases affecting the structure of the heart are the most common type. These defects change the way blood flows through the heart. They also affect the heart's ability to pump blood to the body and lungs.
The most common defect in this category is a hole in the wall that separates the two upper chambers of the heart (atria). This hole is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). Other defects in this category include:
Coarctation or complete interruption of the aorta Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Problems with the heart valves Problems with the blood vessels near the heart
Heart valve problems occur in about 10% of babies with congenital heart disease. Some valves do not open enough to let blood through. This is called a stenosis. Other valves do not close tight enough, which is called regurgitation.
Other congenital heart diseases affect the heart's nerves and muscles. These defects make it hard for the heart to pump blood effectively. They include:
Arrhythmias (irregular, fast, or slow heartbeats) Heart block (where the heart beats abnormally slow) Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) Neurofibromas (abnormal tissue growth)","1. Congenital heart disease (CHD) was first discovered by a Greek scientist named Galen in the 2nd century. 2. In the 19th century, the first congenital heart disease association was established in the United States. 3.

"1. It is generally agreed that 20% of all lung cancers are hereditary.  It is thought that the hereditary forms of lung cancer (there are at least 3 known hereditary patterns) are caused by mutations in 3 genes; BRCA2, TP53, and CHEK2.  Genetic testing for mutations in these genes can be performed, but the clinical utility of this testing is not great.
2. Lung cancer is a very complex disease, and the cause has not been fully explained by genetic science.  There are likely many, many more genes involved in the hereditary forms of the disease, but these tests aren't yet commercially available.
3. It is my opinion that performing genetic testing at this point would be of little use.  I would recommend that genetic testing be performed after your husband's mother passes away.  Lung cancer is a complex disease, and the results of the testing would likely be of little use in protecting your husband from the disease.","1.  Yes.  Lung cancer has strong genetic component and genetic testing can help identify if the cancer in your husband's family is genetic.  2. You didn't mention the type of testing but there are panel and targeted testing for biomarkers like EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, and others which can identify the mutations in the tumor. 3. Blood tests like this are not common.  Usually, a tumor biopsy or blood tests for the biomarkers after a tumor is found are done first. 4. Yes, testing can help identify if the lung cancer in your husband's family is genetic.","Genetic test results can provide information on inherited risk of lung cancer, and comparing test results between family members can be useful in this regard. For example, if your mother-in-law and her daughter (your husband's sister) have the same genetic mutation, then there is likely a inherited risk of lung cancer in your family. It is important to note that not all individuals with lung cancer have inherited risk, and not all individuals with inherited risk will develop lung cancer. Nonetheless, understanding inherited risk can be useful for risk assessment and screening. It is best to discuss your concerns with a qualified healthcare provider who can help interpret test results and provide recommendations based on your individual situation.","Yes, genetic testing can be used to determine if the history of lung cancer in your husband's family is due to a genetic predisposition. There are specific genetic tests, such as the P53 mutation test, that can be carried out on a biopsy or blood sample to determine if a person has a mutation in the P53 gene. This gene is often mutated in people with a family history of lung cancer. If the mutation is detected, other family members may benefit from regular screening for lung cancer, since early detection is the best defense against this disease. Other genetic tests, such as the BRCA mutation test, may also be recommended in some cases. It is important to discuss the results of genetic testing with a qualified healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate course of action based on the specific circumstances of the patient.","1. Unfortunately his mother having lung cancer does not help in determining his risk, as the risk in his case is based on other factors, such as his exposure to risk factors, family history, etc. Genetic testing is required to determine if his family has any mutations that increase his risk. 
2. Lung cancer is rarely hereditary, but if there are other family history factors, genetic testing would be helpful in determining his risk.
3. There are certain genetic tests that can be performed, but it is not routinely done, as most of the time risk is based on other factors.
4. There are certain genetic tests that can be performed on the tumor tissue to determine if there are specific mutations present. These mutations increase the risk in his family.
5. There are certain genetic tests that can be performed on the tumor tissue to determine if there are specific mutations present. These mutations increase the risk in his family.","As you may be aware that lung cancer has strongest association with smoking and tobacco chewing but there are some cases where there is no obvious cause. For example in family where there are 2 or more first degree relatives (parent/child, sibling sibling) having lung cancer then there might be hereditary component. Genetic testing can be done in such families to identify the genetic cause. It can be done in non-smoking population as well but at present there is not enough information about non-smoking hereditary lung cancer.

"1) Symptoms that are not caused by an underlying physical disease are called ""functional"" symptoms. Functional neurological symptoms are exactly as you described.  There are many types of functional (or what some call ""psychological"") symptoms. Some people with medically unexplained symptoms have other problems such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. But not all of these folks have medically unexplained symptoms.
2) Just to clarify, when you say ""when the person claiming blindness is placed near a ledge, does not walk off the ledge"" this is not a valid test for vision loss! If someone is blindfolded and then taken somewhere unfamiliar and then the blindfold is removed, that might be a valid test, but putting someone near a ledge is not valid because many fully sighted people may not walk off a ledge either for many reasons (they might not want to commit suicide, they might not want to break their legs, etc). 
The appropriate medical evaluation for a visual disorder would include an examination of the eyes and vision testing to determine if someone is blind or has reduced vision.

The patient has the symptoms, but there is no underlying physical illness. The physical symptoms are very real and can be disabling, but they are not due to a medical disorder. They represent a response by the body to an emotional conflict. The symptoms resolve when the conflict is resolved.","Does the definition of conversion disorder imply that the physical symptoms are real but lack a clear medical cause, whereas another source defines it as a physical disability that is not caused by any physical impairment, suggesting that the symptoms are visibly present but cannot be supported by medical tests?

The symptoms in conversion disorder are real and do have a cause, but this cause is psychological rather than physical. Patients with conversion disorder do have an underlying physical disability, but this disability is not caused by any physical impairment. Their symptoms are visibly present and cannot be supported by medical tests.","Conversion disorder is a type of psychological disorder in which the patient has physical symptoms that are not fully explained by a medical condition. The symptoms are genuine and can be very distressing, but they are not due to an organic cause. They are caused by the patient's beliefs and expectations. For example, a patient may experience paralysis or blindness, but there is no evidence of any physical problem when their symptoms are examined.

This definition comes from the NHS website: 
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/conversion-disorder/
This second source is a little unclear, but seems to be suggesting that conversion disorder is a physical disability without any physical cause, implying that the symptoms are visibly real but lack any medical evidence:

https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2019/09/12/justice-dept-urged-to-probe-wuhan-outbreak-as-possible-disability-rights-violation/

It's possible that this second source is referring to the fact that conversion disorder is a psychological condition that can cause physical symptoms, but that these symptoms cannot be proven to be due to a physical cause. In other words, the symptoms are real and can be disabling, but they are not due to an organic cause. They are caused by the patient's beliefs and expectations."

"Menkes syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects copper absorption and transport in the body. The outlook for individuals with Menkes disease is poor. Most children with Menkes syndrome die within the first decade of life. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Because the disease affects cells throughout the body, many organs and systems can be involved. Low copper levels (copper deficiency) can lead to a weakened immune system and make individuals more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia.","Menkes syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects copper absorption and transport in the body, leading to growth, developmental and physical problems. There is no cure for Menkes syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.

It is important to talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for your child's individual needs.","Menkes syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects copper absorption and transport in the body. The outlook for individuals with Menkes syndrome is poor, and they require supportive care throughout their lives. As a parent, it is natural to want to help your child as much as possible. Here are some steps you can take to support your daughter with Menkes syndrome:

Educate yourself: The first step to supporting your daughter is to educate yourself about Menkes syndrome. Learn about the symptoms, causes, and treatment options. The more you know, the better equipped you will be to make decisions about her care.

Seek support: It is important for you to have a support system while supporting your daughter. Talk to other parents of children with Menkes syndrome, join online support groups, or see a therapist. Having someone to talk to who understands what you are going through can make a world of difference.

Make therapies available: Your daughter will likely benefit from physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. These therapies can help improve her quality of life and enable her to do as much as possible with the abilities she has.

Make doctor's appointments: It is important to keep regular doctor's appointments so that your daughter can receive ongoing care. Her doctor will monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed.

Encourage development: Encourage your daughter to develop her abilities to the fullest extent possible. Even if she has significant limitations, she can still learn and grow.

Make nutrition a priority: Because individuals with Menkes syndrome have trouble absorbing copper, nutrition is critical. Work with her doctor and a registered dietitian to develop a nutrition plan that meets her needs.

Consider placement options: As your daughter gets older, you may need to consider placement options. Talk to her doctors, therapists, and social workers about the best placement option for her needs.

The prognosis for individuals with Menkes syndrome is poor, but that does not mean you should give up hope. By supporting your daughter and providing her with the care she needs, you can help improve her quality of life and give her the best possible life.","As a parent it is incredibly difficult to watch your child suffer.

"1. Nephrotic Syndrome is a condition in which there is a lot of protein in the urine. It is caused by kidney damage, which allows protein to escape from the kidneys. 

2. The causes of Nephrotic Syndrome are kidney damage due to conditions like diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. 

3. The cure for Nephrotic Syndrome depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is due to diabetes or hypertension, controlling blood sugar and blood pressure can help.

In some cases, kidney transplant may be necessary.","1. Membranous nephropathy 
Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is caused by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The thickening is caused by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane. The immune complexes are formed in the circulation and then deposited in the mesangium and basement membrane. The common causes of immune complex deposition are viral infections, bacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases. The common causes of membranous nephropathy are hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Membranous nephropathy 
Membranous nephropathy is a type of kidney disease in which the glomeruli (the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that help filter waste and fluids from the blood) become thickened and scarred. This leads to a progressive loss of kidney function. Membranous nephropathy is caused by thickening of parts of the glomerular basement membrane. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidney that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. 
The exact cause of this thickening is not known. However, it is thought that some substance in the blood (antigen) causes the immune system to produce antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane. These antibodies make the membrane thicker. Membranous nephropathy is most common in men in the 40-50 age group. The condition affects both sides of the kidney equally. Membranous nephropathy is also known as membranous glomerulonephritis.

Other etiologies include post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis, and thin basement membrane disease (type 4 collagen defect).
2 Treatment
The treatment of nephrotic syndrome is dependent on the underlying etiology and the severity of the disease. The mainstay of therapy for nephrotic syndrome is reducing proteinuria. This can be achieved with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and other immunosuppressants. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommends initiating treatment with corticosteroids. If there is no response after 4-6 weeks of therapy, cyclophosphamide should be initiated. Cyclophosphamide is considered the drug of choice. It is given at a dose of 2mg/kg per day for 1-3 weeks. If there is no response to cyclophosphamide, other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus should be considered.
In patients who have nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS, the treatment of choice is corticosteroids. If there is no response to corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide or rituximab can be added.
The mainstay of treatment for nephrotic syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is steroids and immunosuppressants.

The surgery is more of a procedure to get the patient into the ICU and to get her comfortable, and to unkink the bowel to get rid of the bad smell. Nothing can be done to save her. Sorry to say this, but this is the hard truth of medicine.","12 hours is not going to make any difference in most cases of bowel ischemia. The damage to the intestine is usually pretty extensive by that time. The surgeon is trying to do the right thing in trying to reassess to see if there is any improvement. It is a very difficult call whether to operate or not when the patient is unresponsive. Often they will do an intestinal assessment balloon test at that time to see if there is any improvement. There is a fine balance between doing a futile surgery and losing a patient who could be saved. It is a difficult call for the surgeon and obviously hindsight is 20/20. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem and not often amenable to solution.","It's impossible to know for sure if prompt action would have saved her.  Septic shock is a terrible condition and hard to beat.  Certainly the delay in treatment couldn't have helped.
I'm very sorry for your loss.","12 hours is not a long time in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Many diseases are not diagnosed so quickly. Bowel isemia is not a very common disease. It sounds like the doctor was trying to be careful and evaluate a possible diagnosis of bowel perforation which is much more common and usually treated with surgery.
The outcome in this case was probably a result of the amount of damage to the bowel already done by the time the diagnosis was made. 90% of the bowel had to be removed because it was already dead. This is a very serious complication of any abdominal disease which can cause death in a high percentage of patients even with surgery.
It is possible that a more rapid diagnosis could have saved her life, but we can't know for sure. The condition was probably already doing severe damage before she even got to the hospital.","I am sorry to hear that. It is a very unfortunate event. It is important that you grapple with the circumstances surrounding her death, in order to overcome the grief and eventually come to terms with it. It is not an easy process, but it is important for your own psychological well-being. You should not repress your feelings or avoid dealing with them. They will eventually surface again in some other form, if you don't deal with them now. It is important to talk to friends and family, or a professional counselor, when you feel ready for it. You should also give yourself time to heal. It is a process, and it takes time. Take care."

Patients with Lyme disease may develop a variety of long-term complications, including joint and muscle pain, cognitive impairment, and heart block. The risk of these problems occurring increases the longer the infection remains untreated. Since undiagnosed diabetes can lead to a variety of long-term complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney damage, and nerve damage, your husband may need to closely monitor his health in the coming years.  He should work closely with his doctors to manage both his diabetes and his Lyme disease infection to minimize his risk of developing these complications. I hope that helps!","Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. This disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Symptoms of RMSF usually begin 2-14 days after a person is bitten by an infected tick. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. In general, the symptoms of RMSF are usually more severe in adults and older children than in young children. Most people recover completely from RMSF. Some people may have long-term, minor health problems, such as joint pain. But the disease can be severe and even life threatening in a small number of people. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. Lyme disease has an incubation period of 3-30 days (average: 7-10 days). Symptoms of Lyme disease usually begin with flu-like symptoms and a characteristic rash. Most people will recover without treatment, but the disease can be more complicated in some individuals.  The long-term consequences of Lyme disease are not completely understood. Research is ongoing, especially regarding the large number of people who have chronic health problems after Lyme disease. People who are bitten by an infected tick can develop a number of problems, including chronic arthritis, chronic fatigue, and neurological problems such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating.

In the few RMSF cases with neurological examinations, the patients had neurological problems. In dogs, RMSF causes damage to the nervous system, endocrine system, and can cause death.  The disease destroys the cells in the nervous system early in the infection. The damage to the endocrine system can result in hypothyroidism. 
2. There are no studies that show the effects of Lyme Disease long term. In dogs, Lyme Disease can cause arthritis, and can be fatal. 
3. Type II diabetes can be affected by both RMSF and Lyme Disease. Type II diabetes has been shown to be increased in dogs with RMSF.  Insulin resistance is seen in Lyme Disease.  There is a possibility that your husband could have an increased risk for diabetes complications due to the previous infections. The risk for complications is increased when diabetes is not well controlled. Talk to his doctor about monitoring his blood sugar levels closely, and how to best manage his diabetes.

I hope this answered your question. I broke the answer into sections to make it easier to read. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.","As per your history both the disease are caused by bacterial infection. The common cause is bacteria borrelliia. The symptoms and signs may be similar however the major differential is the geographical location. Rocky mountain spotted fever is a disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. It is transmitted by ticks. Major symptoms are fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Serological tests are not reliable for the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often made by identifying the organism in the blood smear. Treatment is doxycycline.  
On the other hand Lyme disease is caused by borrelia burgdorferi. It is also transmitted by ticks. Major symptoms are fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Serological tests are reliable for the diagnosis. Treatment is doxycycline with or without antibiotics. 
Hence the geographical location and clinical presentation differentiate both the diseases.  Hope I answered your question.","Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. These are two different bacteria causing two different diseases. The symptoms and clinical presentation of the diseases may overlap in some cases, but the diagnosis is not interchangeable. 

Because your question is asking about long-term complications, I will say that both RMSF and Lyme disease can have long-term complications. Neither disease is something to take lightly. In the case of Lyme disease, long-term complications can include arthritis, chronic fatigue, and neurological problems. For RMSF, long-term complications can include endocarditis, arthritis, and neurological problems. 

For the record, it is highly unlikely that your husband has both of these diseases. The fact that he has type 2 diabetes is a non-issue. For both diseases, a vaccine exists and is recommended for dogs. If your husband's dog has these vaccines, then your husband is at much less risk of contracting the disease. If your husband does not have these vaccines, then he should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible."
"1) Kidney transplant is the treatment for kidney failure. However, it is not advisable to undergo a transplant surgery, if the patient is not qualified for it. 2) You didn't mention your lab results. However, it is mandatory to have a lab report indicating the patient's lab findings. The lab report must be issued by a certified laboratory. The hospital lab is not trustworthy, as the staff there might easily forge lab reports to get money. 3) After the surgery, the patient has to take immunosuppressants for life. Immunosuppressants are strong medications, which weaken the body immunity against infections and cancer. 4) Kidney transplant is a major surgery. The surgery has many risks, such as rejection of the transplanted kidney, infections, bleeding, abdominal obstruction, etc. 5) Before the surgery, the patient has to undergo many lab tests, such as tissue type, blood type, routine tests, etc. The donor and the recipient has to be well matched to avoid many post-operative complications. 6) The recipient has to undergo dialysis before the surgery, to make the patient's body ready for the surgery and to reduce many post-operative complications. 7) The recipient has to take very strict medical instructions before and after the surgery to avoid rejection of the transplanted kidney. If the recipient doesn't follow the medical instructions, the transplanted kidney will be rejected. In such case, the patient has to go on dialysis again. 8) The recipient has to undergo frequent medical follow up after the surgery to monitor the function of the transplanted kidney and to detect early sign of rejection. 9) The recipient has to take many medications after the surgery. The medications are strong and have many side effects. 10) The recipient has to be well informed of the surgical procedure, the post-operative care, the medications, the lab tests, etc. 11) The recipient has to sign a legal document, stating that he/she agrees to take immunosuppressants for life, to avoid rejection of the transplanted kidney. 12)","30-year-old [NAME], I'm sorry to hear about your suffering, but I'm glad to hear that you're actively seeking a kidney transplant. Kidney transplants are common and successful procedures - in fact, there are often long waiting lists of patients who need kidneys, but don't have compatible donors. It's important to stay positive and keep a good attitude throughout the process, as negative thoughts and anxiety can weaken your immune system and make recovery more difficult. It's also important to stay in close contact with your doctors and follow their instructions closely, as failing to do so can lead to rejection of the new kidney. Best of luck to you, [NAME], and may you find a compatible donor soon.","30 years old is very young for dialysis and transplant, usually we wait until 40-50 years old before doing the transplant.  You have been on dialysis for 10 years, so you must have been diagnosed with kidney failure since you were about 20 years old.  It is unusual for someone so young to have kidney failure, do you know why?  Also, we usually do not consider someone for transplant until they have been on dialysis for at least 2-3 years.  Why the rush for transplant?  Has the nephrologist talked to you about this?  I am concerned that maybe you are being taken advantage of.  Please be careful and make sure you know what is going on.",10 years is a long time to struggle with this. It is good that you are proactive in searching for a solution. Unfortunately kidney transplant is the only solution for now. I am not sure what you mean by slow and rare. The process of getting a donor should be the focus. I suggest you look to other countries for the procedure as a viable option. Talk to your nephrologist about this. He or she will be able to guide you appropriately. It is important to have realistic expectations. Not everyone will be successful in this process. You should prepare for this eventuality. It is important to have a good support system in place to help you cope in the event of a setback.,"1. Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice in a patient with chronic renal failure.
2. However, the lack of donors and the recent outbreak of COVID-19 infection makes the procedure difficult to perform nowadays.
3. Therefore, it is recommended that you wait for the COVID-19 pandemic to pass before proceeding with the transplant.","10 years is a long time to suffer, especially with a condition that has no cure in your country. I'm sure you've exhausted all avenues in your home country.

You're right, a kidney transplant is the only cure for chronic renal failure. A donor kidney is the only source of a cure, but you don't have one.

However, a donor doesn't necessarily have to be a family member. Any compatible donor will do - that's the good news.

The bad news is, compatible donors are hard to come by, especially in your part of the world. That's because most people are unwilling to donate a kidney to a stranger.

But if you really want a cure, you should consider going to a country where the donors are more willing to donate to anyone in need. I've heard that Iran, India, Pakistan and Brazil have more willing donors. They have a more ""liberal"" view towards donation, which is why you're more likely to find a donor there.

Of course, going abroad for the surgery is going to be very expensive. You'll need to consider that too. If you don't have the money, then you might want to stay where you are and accept your fate. It's a very difficult decision to make.

Please do consider my advice. I hope I could help in some way."

1. Recommend they get in touch with a charity such as the Royal Society for the Blind or Vision Australia. These organisations can help people adapt to their condition and provide support.

2. Suggest they try learning a tactile alternative to reading, like braille. It may not help them read regular text, but it can help them read braille text.

3. Recommend they undergo surgery to remove the cataracts that may be clouding their eyes. Cataract surgery is relatively safe and effective, and can greatly improve their vision even without a cure for Leber's amaurosis.

4. If they have a smartphone or tablet, recommend they look into accessibility features. Both Android and iOS have accessibility features that can make reading easier, such as text-to-speech and large font sizes. There are also many apps designed specifically for the visually impaired, such as screen reading apps and apps that can read text out loud.

5. Encourage them to keep in contact with friends and family, and to make use of support groups for the visually impaired. Isolation can make their condition worse, while social interaction can improve their quality of life.","Leber's amaurosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes blindness in children.

Oculocutaneous albinism is a rare inherited disorder of hypopigmentation, mainly affecting the skin and the eyes. 
OCA2 is the most common type of OCA. OCA2 is characterized by a reduction in tyrosinase activity, leading to decreased synthesis of melanin, resulting in white or hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes.
Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical findings. Associated features include red/pink hair, freckles, and iris hypopigmentation.
Genetic testing for OCA2 can be performed when the diagnosis is uncertain.
Patients with OCA2 usually have normal intelligence.
Decreased melanin synthesis results in white hair, skin, and eyes.
OCA2 is an autosomal recessive disorder.

The diagnosis of albinism is based on the lack of tyrosinase activity or defective tyrosinase activity as in Oculocutaneous Albinism. Skin and eye color in different individuals with albinism can be different. In most cases, albinism is identified by the diagnosis of the gene defect rather than by the clinical symptoms. The most common type of albinism is Oculocutaneous albinism which is caused by defective tyrosinase activity. The other types of albinism include Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Ocular albinism, and inherited albinism. You need to identify the gene defective in your case. I suggest you to consult a geneticist for diagnosis.","Albinism is a genetically inherited condition resulting in decreased tyrosinase activity or defective tyrosine transport. It is commonly characterized by hypopigmentation and photodermatosis. However, there are multiple types of albinism with different underlying genetic mutations.

Hi, Chest pain is not directly related to esophageal problems, but the esophagitis can cause difficulty swallowing which may cause chest pain when the esophagus becomes irritated. 2. You need to see a doctor, the chest pain could be from the gastritis or the diverticulosis, both of which can be treated. The difficulty speaking could be from the esophagitis. 3. You should have a complete physical and lab work to determine the cause of the chest pain and difficulty swallowing. 4. The doctor will determine the treatment needed depending on the causes found. 5. The outlook is good if treated, but the chest pain could be serious if caused by the diverticulosis.","1. The first thing that comes to my mind when I see a 72-year-old female with chest pain and struggles to talk is Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and/or Degenerative Cardiac Disease.2. I would suggest you to get an ECG, echocardiogram, and cardiac stress test.3. Meanwhile, I suggest you to also get a chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes, complete blood count, and thyroid function test.4. For the gastrointestinal issues, I would suggest you to get a gastrostomy, gallbladder ultrasound, stool analysis, and liver function test.5. It's crucial to treat CAD as soon as possible, so, please, go to the ER as soon as possible. I will be at your disposal to answer any further questions.","1. Your chest pain is more likely to be due to your esophagitis, since you don't mention having a cough.  The chest pain associated with the gastritis and diverticulosis is more likely to be associated with the painful cramps that can occur with these conditions, rather than cardiac pain.
2. Your speech difficulties are more likely to be due to the esophagitis, since this is also associated with difficulty swallowing.  The gastritis and diverticulosis do not typically cause speech difficulties.","1. Diverticulosis
Diverticulosis is a condition in which small pouches or sacs develop in the wall of the colon. It is not a serious condition, and it is common in the elderly. The most common symptom of diverticulosis is bloating or constipation. Pain is rare, and if it occurs it is more likely to be cramping rather than sharp or stabbing pain.
Treatment
•   Dietary changes: Eating more fiber can help alleviate constipation.
•   Laxatives: Over-the-counter laxatives such as lactulose or sorbitol can be used to treat constipation.
•   Medications: Medications such as cholestyramine resins can be prescribed to treat chronic constipation.
2. Gastritis and Esophagitis
Gastritis is a condition in which the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed. Esophagitis is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus becomes inflamed. Both conditions can cause chest pain, especially when swallowing. Gastritis is often caused by excessive alcohol consumption, certain medications, or bile reflux. Esophagitis is often caused by acid reflux.
Treatment
•   Dietary changes: Avoiding acidic and spicy foods can help alleviate symptoms.
•   Medications: Proton pump inhibitors (acid-blocking medications) such as omeprazole can be prescribed to treat gastritis and acid reflux.
•   Surgery: Surgery may be recommended for people with severe esophagitis to prevent further damage to the esophagus.","1. You should go to the hospital emergency room or your physician if the pain is severe and/or you have difficulty breathing.
2. Chest pain is a sign of warning. Do not ignore it. You need a doctor to evaluate you for a heart attack, aortic dissection, and other diseases that can cause chest pain.
3. Esophagitis can cause chest pain if it leads to esophageal ulcer or esophageal rupture."

This is because the assays measure the overall clotting time, of which the factor VIII/ IX component is only a part. In severe cases, however, the assays are almost always positive.

As to genetic tests, they are the most reliable means of confirming a hemophilia diagnosis. They can detect mutations in the clotting factors VIII and IX, and can even detect carrier females.","Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. If an individual has a history of internal bleeding and hemmorhaging after injuries, it does not necessarily mean that they have hemophilia. While blood clotting assays would reveal positive results for individuals with mild to moderate hemophilia, a severe case of hemophilia may result in negative blood clotting assay results. Diagnosis of hemophilia can be achieved through genetic testing, which will reveal abnormal clotting factor levels. It is important to note that while hemophilia is a genetic disorder, its severity can vary widely between individuals. A healthcare provider can provide more information about hemophilia and its treatment options.","1. When there is a history of spontaneous bleeding and hemmorhaging after injuries, one should recommend a complete blood clotting assay and genetic test for hemophilia.

2. For the blood clotting assay, one should measure the time it takes for the blood to clot. This is because people with hemophilia A typically have a higher clotting time than people without hemophilia A.

3. For the genetic test, one should look for a specific gene mutation that is associated with hemophilia A. This mutation is an insertion of the PTT (partial thromboplastin time) gene.

4. A positive result for either the blood clotting assay or the genetic test would indicate the presence of hemophilia A.

5. It is important to note that a negative result for both tests does not necessarily mean that hemophilia A is ruled out, as there may be other factors at play.","1.  A bedside whole blood assay to check for clotting factor levels (normal levels range from 75 to 125%)
2.  A clotting factor profile to check for normal and abnormal clotting factors (low levels = hemophilia)
3.  A recombinant factor assay to check for low levels of clotting factors that are normally made in the body
4.  A prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) to check the blood's ability to clot
5.  If the patient is male, a genetic test to check for the hemophilia gene on the X chromosome (located at Xq28)

I would recommend these tests to someone with a history of internal bleeding, hemmorhaging after injuries, and a family history of heavy bleeding to diagnose hemophilia."

If you mean a complete resolution of your symptoms, yes it is possible, although this is uncommon. Most people see a gradual reduction in their symptoms over time and a complete resolution is uncommon.  If you mean eliminating the underlying pathophysiology which causes the reflux, then no it is not possible.  The pathophysiology of GERD is a complex interplay between anatomy, physiology, nutrition and medications.  It is important to identify what your personal risk factors are and make the appropriate changes to reduce your symptoms.","3 years is a long time to suffer from a disease, I understand how frustrating it can be. To answer your question, yes GERD can be cured, however it depends from person to person on how long it took for the disease to develop and how severe the damage is. GERD is a disease caused due to the reflux of acid from the stomach to the esophagus. It is important to understand the severity of the disease, which can be determined by the endoscopy report, biopsy report, and the nature of symptoms. 

In my patients, I first ask them to make dietary and lifestyle changes. I advise them to avoid spicy food, coffee, smoking and alcohol. I also ask them to increase their water intake and eat dinner 2 hours before going to bed. I also have them on medication like proton pump inhibitors to reduce the acid production. Depending on the severity of the disease, I also recommend surgery to correct any anatomical abnormalities. Surgery is usually reserved for patients who have tried the medical management without success. 

I suggest you speak to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. Do not lose hope, GERD can be treated.","As the question is currently phrased, the answer is No. However, the symptoms can be managed and controlled. Dietary modifications, weight loss, not lying down after eating and a host of other suggestions can keep the symptoms under control. Occasionally, a surgical procedure to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is performed.","It depends on the individual. Some people have a genetic predisposition for acid reflux and may require a lifetime of management. However, lifestyle changes and medication can provide relief for most people.","3 years is a long time to suffer from anything, I am sorry to hear that you have had to deal with GERD for so long. There are several treatments for GERD, and it seems that you have tried most of them. The mainstay of treatment includes lifestyle modifications (such as weight loss and dietary modifications), antireflux medications and surgery. It is important to note that the success rates for surgery are not much higher than 50%, and it is not without its own complications. If you have tried the other treatment options, and they have been unsuccessful, surgery would be your next best option. I would suggest that you discuss this with your doctor."
"1: The diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on:

A. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with lateral lumbar spine and femoral neck measurements.
B. Histological examination of bone samples. These samples can be taken from the vertebral bodies (usually 2-4 vertebrae), the distal femur, or other sites.
C. Other tests include ultrasound, CT scan, or quantitative CT (QCT). These tests are used less frequently than DEXA.
2: To diagnose child abuse, the doctor needs to know the mechanism, the severity, the age of onset, and the effect on growth and development. He also needs to know the circumstances of the child and the family. Plain X-rays, CT scans, and other imaging studies are used to diagnose child abuse.","I would advise you to look for information on child abuse, because that's the most likely cause of multiple fractures in a child. Osteogenesis Imperfecta does not cause multiple fractures, and genetic testing for it is not recommended unless there are other symptoms present (like blue sclerae).

If you or someone you know is being abused, you can contact The National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or report it here: https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/.","I am sorry to hear about the situation you are in. It must be very difficult for you. Unfortunately, I don't have access to any specific resources that would be of help to you. However, I can provide some general suggestions which I hope will be of help. 

Firstly, try to stay calm and strong for your child. He/she is going to need you more than ever during this time. Make sure to give him/her lots of tender loving care and provide as much comfort as possible. Try to ensure that the child's routine is as normal as possible, as much as can be expected. This will help the child feel secure and stable, and will also help to prevent any developmental delays which may be triggered by the stressful situation. 

Secondly, it is very important that you inform yourself about osteogenesis imperfecta. Read as much as you can about it. There are some good online resources available. You should know that osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder which is caused by mutations in the genes coding for type I collagen. It results in abnormally weak bones which are prone to fractures. It is a lifelong condition, but a manageable one. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta lead normal lives and have normal life spans. They require some precautions to be taken, such as adopting a healthy lifestyle, avoiding high-risk activities, and wearing protective gear during physical activity, but they are otherwise completely normal. 

Thirdly, discuss the situation with your doctor. Ask for reassurance that what you are experiencing is within the range of normal symptoms for osteogenesis imperfecta. Ask your doctor any questions you may have about the condition or about how to care for your child. Most importantly, ask your doctor to help you get genetic testing done for your child. This is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta. You should also ask your doctor for resources which you can use to learn more about the condition. 

Lastly, be strong and persistent in denying the child abuse allegations. Explain to the authorities that you are aware of osteogenesis imperfecta and that you are taking your child to a geneticist to get the diagnosis confirmed. Show","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder passed down from either one or both parents. It is passed on by either a dominant or recessive gene.  In recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta, the child will have a severe form of the disease and will have a lack of type I collagen.  In dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta, the child may have a mild form of the disease due to the presence of type I collagen.  The severity of Osteogenesis Imperfecta varies from child to child due to the type of collagen that is present.  If your family members are currently undergoing genetic testing, they may be able to determine whether the child has a recessive or dominant form of Osteogenesis Imperfecta.  If you are facing allegations of child abuse, it is important to show medical evidence of Osteogenesis Imperfecta to the courts.  This will help prove that the child has a genetic disorder and was not physically abused.  It is important to seek legal advice if you are facing child abuse allegations.","I understand your concern. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder with many types. It is caused due to mutation in genes coding for type I collagen. Common symptoms include blue sclerae,bones that fracture easily, hearing loss and dentin dysplasia. It can be diagnosed by collagen biopsy, genetic testing and X-rays.  For type I collagen deficiency, treatment with collagen supplement and vitamin D is helpful. For type II and III,guided growth with rib grafting and surgical repair at the time of diagnosis is helpful.  For type IV, treatment with guided growth is helpful. Surgical repair is also helpful for type II and III. Please discuss with your doctor for further information. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.","Genetic testing for OI is not recommended. Clinical findings and the patient's history are sufficient for diagnosis. However, in cases of child abuse, genetic testing can be used to support or refute the diagnosis. It can also provide evidence of having a child with OI when there is suspicion of child abuse. In any case, the results of genetic testing should be interpreted with caution.

The diagnosis of OI is usually based on the patient's history and clinical findings. It is a suspected condition in cases of child abuse. Genetic testing can be used as a supplemental diagnostic tool. The results of genetic testing should be interpreted with caution."
"Precisely why one episode of pneumonia gives no protection against a second episode is unclear. However, the following factors may be important:

Immunity takes time to develop, and the typical pneumonia takes at least 2 weeks from the first symptoms before resolving completely.
Bacteria causing pneumonia may be insensitive to antibiotics, and sometimes antibiotics may even make the condition worse by suppressing the immune system.
People may be exposed to a variety of pathogens in a short time period (particularly the elderly who are more likely to be exposed to nosocomial pneumonia), and this can lead to a second episode of pneumonia.

Thus, it is not unlikely for a second episode of pneumonia to occur, and in some cases it may even be a different type of pneumonia (e.g., bacterial, viral, or atypical).",The likelihood of atypical pneumonia recurring within a month of treatment is low.,"It can, but it's uncommon. The likelihood of relapse is higher in cases of atypical pneumonia than typical pneumonia because the typical pneumonia is usually caused by a viral infection, which can clear out of the body much faster than bacteria that cause atypical pneumonia.  

Most doctors will try to treat pneumonia successfully with the first choice of therapy and will change therapy only if pneumonia worsens or if there is a threat of other complications arising.  

If there is a second episode of pneumonia following the first one, the usual approach is to assume it is a new infection rather than a relapse, and to treat it accordingly. 

If you are asking if it's possible to have the same infection again (that is, if the first infection doesn't go away and just lingers), this is possible, but unlikely, especially in otherwise healthy patients.","Chances of experiencing atypical pneumonia again in under a month following treatment are slim. 

Atypical pneumonia, also known as walking pneumonia, is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria other than Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is called atypical because it does not include typical symptoms such as high fever, severe cough, and blood in sputum. The symptoms are more likely to be nasal congestion, headache, and muscle aches.

The treatment of atypical pneumonia is typically antibiotics such as macrolides, tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones. Once treatment is completed, the chances of experiencing the pneumonia again under a month following treatment are slim. This is because the antibiotics are effective in treating the infection and preventing its recurrence.

It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by the physician to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, it is recommended to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease and influenza to prevent pneumonia and its recurrence.","The quick answer is yes. Atypical pneumonia can recur in less than a month after treatment. 

Atypical pneumonia, also known as walking pneumonia, is a type of pneumonia that is caused by bacteria other than Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Atypical pneumonia is typically treated with antibiotics such as macrolides, rifampin, or fluoroquinolones for a duration of 5-7 days.  

Recurrence of pneumonia is uncommon. However, in rare cases, pneumonia may recur within weeks of the first episode. This is more likely to occur in individuals with weakened immune systems or other underlying medical conditions. These individuals may have a secondary bacterial infection, which can cause a recurrence of pneumonia. 

It is important to note that if you have symptoms of pneumonia, such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, it is important to contact your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.","The probability of having atypical pneumonia again within a month of finishing treatment is not very high. Typical treatment for pneumonia involves the use of antibiotics such as macrolides, cephalosporins, or fluoroquinolones for bacterial pneumonia, and antivirals for atypical pneumonia.  While the chance of contracting pneumonia again in such a short time span is not zero, it is very low. Additionally, the likelihood that the second case would also be atypical is also quite small. Patients who have contracted pneumonia once are at higher risk of developing another case, but the risk is dependent on several factors, including age, overall health, and immune status."
"1. What is fibromyalgia?
Fibromyalgia is a common condition characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points, and an associated polysymptomatic profile.
The tender points are typically multiple, well-defined, focal areas of tenderness located at characteristic sites; these sites have been called “tender points.” Tender points are not the same as trigger points.
The associated polysymptomatic profile includes fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive symptoms (e.g., “fibro fog”).
The symptoms of fibromyalgia can fluctuate and are often recapitulated through the course of the illness.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness. Although the symptoms sometimes improve, they rarely, if ever, resolve completely.
2. Etiology of fibromyalgia
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown.
Psychological stress, sleep disturbances, and physical trauma are among the various factors that may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia.
The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is not fully understood.
The hallmark of fibromyalgia is diffuse musculoskeletal pain.
The tender points in fibromyalgia are multiple, well-defined, focal areas of tenderness located at characteristic sites. These sites have been called tender points. Tender points are not the same as trigger points.

3. It is important to note that warts may return and that multiple treatments may be necessary. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid any sharp objects that may cause further irritation or injury.","1) If the warts are resistant to treatment, you can try cryotherapy
  in a doctor's office, where the warts are frozen off with liquid
  nitrogen.

2) Another option is to have them removed surgically, sometimes with
  minor surgery to remove them, or they may be burned off with electrocautery.

3) Or, you can try duct tape! Place a piece over the wart and leave it
  for a week, then remove and replace with a new piece every few days
  for a few weeks.

4) Also, some people have reported success with immunizing against
  viruses by applying human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, but this is
  not approved medical treatment.

5) If you have a weakened immune system, consult your doctor before
  trying any of these treatments.","1. The best medicine or cream for removing warts is not known.
  Different medicines and creams work for different people.
  Sometimes, a wart may grow back.

Discussion: There are many over-the-counter (OTC) wart removers to choose from. The difference between them is often hard to see. Most wart removers will remove warts, but some work better than others. Some work on only specific types of warts. Some people find that a particular product works best for them, while others find that a different product works best for them. Because warts can be contagious (spread from one part of your own body to another), you should not use someone else's wart removal product on your wart. If one wart removal product doesn't work, try another one. If one type of wart doesn't respond to treatment, try another type. Most warts respond to repeated treatment. Treatment is usually discontinued once the wart is gone for good. But, occasionally, the wart may return."
"1) This is an X-linked recessive disorder, so if your mother's father had the disease, and your brother has the disease, you have the disease (to some degree at least).
2) There is no cure for retinitis pigmentosa.  There are some treatments in the research and development stage, but none have yet been proven effective.
3) You should make sure that your vision is optimized by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.  Retinitis pigmentosa does not have to mean ""imprisonment"" because you have a chance to adjust to your reduced vision and compensate for your reduced vision.  You may, for example, find that you can read more easily with a magnifying glass than with regular reading glasses.  There are many such tricks.
4) You can expect to have a gradual worsening of your vision.  It is important to have your vision tested on a regular basis so that you can take advantage of any possible newer treatments as they become available.","Question: Is there hope for recovery from this X-linked disease, and can we expect to see normally like others?

Answer: Unfortunately no. It is an X-linked disease so there is very little hope that it can be reversed. If it is X-linked, then the mutated gene responsible for the disease is present in every cell of your body. 
If it was a dominant disease (not X-linked), there would be a chance of recovery because the defective gene (mutated or not) can be overridden by a normal copy of the gene from one parent. 
If it was recessive, there is still a chance of recovery if both copies of the gene are defective (in which case the person has the disease) because in this case the good copy of the gene can be turned on and the person will be healthy. 
In your case, because it is X-linked, the person has the gene and will always have it.","Unfortunately, the answer is no. X-linked diseases are genetic and do not have a cure yet. You and your family members carry the mutated gene and will have the symptoms throughout your lives. I am sorry.","Your question seems to be a bit vague, so I will try to clarify as much as I can.
First, x-linked disease or conditions are genetic and usually present from birth.
In regards to low-light vision, there are several aspects of the eye that can affect this. One of which is the lens of the eye. The lens becomes less flexible as we age, making it harder to focus on objects, especially up close. This is something that can be helped with glasses or contact lenses.
Another aspect of the eye is the rod and cone cells. Rod cells are sensitive to light, but they cannot detect color. They are used for night vision. Cone cells are the opposite, they can detect color, but they need light to do so. In individuals with low light vision, there is often a deficiency of rod cells.
There are also several other aspects of the eye that can affect vision, such as the retina, the optic nerve, etc.
I would suggest that you have your eyes examined by an ophthalmologist or optometrist to determine which aspect of the eye is affecting your vision. From there, they can give you options as to how to improve your vision.
In regards to the myopia, this is a refractive error of the eye. This means that the eye is shaped differently than a normal eye. This causes light to not focus properly on the retina, which in turn causes close objects to look clear, but objects in the distance appear blurry.
There are several options to correct myopia, including glasses, contacts, and refractive surgery (LASIK).
I hope this helps and good luck!","Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, this is a fictional answer to illustrate the possible answers a doctor might give to this question.

Answer: It is unfortunate that your family has a history of this vision-impairing disease. Based on your description of the symptoms, I can confirm that this disease is X-linked, which means that it is caused by a genetic mutation and primarily affects males.

The disease is characterized by myopia, which is a common cause of vision problems, especially with close objects. This is due to a degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina, which are responsible for detecting light and converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.

While there is no cure for this disease, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. This can include corrective lenses or surgery to improve vision, as well as other supportive measures like mobility training to improve safety and independence.

I am sorry that there is no definitive cure for this disease, but there are many ways to manage the symptoms and lead a fulfilling life. It is important to work closely with an ophthalmologist and other medical professionals to develop a personalized treatment plan for your specific needs.","Question: Is there a chance for us to recover from this X-linked disease and see normally like others?

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions."
"It depends on the stage of the disease. Endometriosis is a chronic disease that affects mostly women of reproductive age. The severity of endometriosis may differ from person to person. Common symptoms of endometriosis are pelvic pain or pain during intercourse, infertility, and irregular bleeding. Treatment of endometriosis consists of pain management, hormonal treatment and surgery. The ultimate treatment is to remove the uterus and ovaries, but this is not recommended for reproductive age women. 

I hope this answer was helpful.","1. The worst-case scenario for endometriosis is a chocolate cyst. A chocolate cyst is a cyst that has developed on the ovary and is filled with old blood, giving it a dark color. This can cause pain and discomfort, as well as complications such as infertility or irregular periods. Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it, causing pain and other symptoms. It can affect women of reproductive age and is often diagnosed through imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI. While there is no cure for endometriosis, there are treatments available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.","Yes. Endometriosis can lead to severe symptoms. Dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and bowel and bladder dysfunction are some of the severe symptoms that can occur in women with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it, causing pain and other complications. It can affect women of reproductive age and is often diagnosed around the time of menarche. Treatment options include pain management, hormonal therapy, and surgery in severe cases.","The severity of endometriosis symptoms vary from person to person. While some women have mild pain or infertility, other women suffer from severe pain or infertility. Severe pain can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and fatigue, and can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Infertility can also have a profound impact on a person's life. 

It is important to note that the severity of symptoms is not necessarily correlated with the severity of the disease. Some women with mild endometriosis symptoms may suffer from significant pain or infertility, while other women with severe endometriosis symptoms may have no problems getting pregnant.","""The most extreme effects of endometriosis are infertility and cancer.""

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice.

"Gastroparesis is a chronic condition that prevents the normal release of digestive enzymes and hormones into the small intestine, resulting in poorly digested food, nutritional deficiencies, and other complications.

Feeding tube is a gastrointestinal tube, a soft, flexible tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach, used to provide nutrition for someone who cannot swallow because of a physical or mental impairment.

TPN is total parenteral nutrition, a medical therapy in which nutritional support is provided by intravenous infusion of nutrient broth, without enteral feeding.","1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes longer than normal to empty its contents into the small intestine. It is caused by dysfunction of the vagus nerve which regulates the contractions of the muscles of the stomach and intestines.

2. A gastric tube is a tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach. It is passed down into the stomach through the esophagus. A gastrostomy tube is a tube that is similar to a nasogastric tube, but it is connected to a port implanted under the skin. The tube can then be connected to a pump that delivers nutrition directly into the stomach.

3. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of providing nutrition that bypasses the digestive system. A catheter is passed through a vein into one of the large veins that takes blood back to the heart. Nutrient solution is passed through the catheter and into the bloodstream.",Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes longer than normal to empty its contents into the small intestine.

TPN (total parenteral nutrition) is a method of providing nutrition that involves delivering nutrients directly into a vein.,Gastroparesis is a condition where the stomach takes longer than normal time to empty its contents into the small intestine. Feeding tubes are usually recommended in patients with Gastroparesis who have developed nutritional deficiency. They are helped with nutrition through the feeding tubes. TPN is a intravenous way of giving nutrition. It is usually preferred over feeding tubes in patients with Gastroparesis when the patients have developed nutritional deficiency. The choice depends on the treating doctor and the severity of the condition. Hope I could answer your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards Chat Doctor.,"1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes longer than normal to empty its contents into the small intestine. Delayed gastric emptying causes food to collect in the stomach, leading to various complications. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, abdominal pain and bloating. It can be diagnosed by a gastric emptying study, where a meal is ingested and the rate of gastric emptying is measured. 
2. Feeding tubes are used when a person is unable to take in sufficient nutrition through eating or oral feeding. It is a route of administration of nutrition when other routes like oral, gastric or rectal are not possible. They are inserted usually in the peripheral vein in the arm and passed up into the gastrointestinal tract to the stomach or small bowel.
3. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) is a method of giving nutrition that involves delivering a specially formulated mixture of nutrients and fluids through a central venous catheter, a tube that is placed into a large vein. TPN is used when a person cannot take enough nutrients by mouth or through an enteral tube (such as a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube).","1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. This is due to a problem with the nerve that controls the muscles of the stomach.

Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, reflux, abdominal pain, bloating, early satiety, and weight loss.

People with gastroparesis can have problems absorbing nutrients, and some people may need to be on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and have a feeding tube.

2. Feeding tubes are generally used when someone can't eat or can't eat enough to get the nutrients they need.

A tube is inserted through the nose, into the stomach. The tube is connected to a feeding bag that is emptied according to the person's nutritional needs.

"100 and 120 is quite far from the normal blood sugar levels, and he should consult his doctor and increase the insulin dose. Exercise can help lower blood sugar levels, but it is not recommended to go for exercise without adjusting the insulin dosage. He should always carry some glucose tablets or gel with him in case of low blood sugar. Complications of diabetes, if left uncontrolled, can be severe and lead to hospitalization.","There is always a potential for complications with diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2. 

There are two types of blood sugar targets to be aware of. The first is the fasting blood sugar (FBS) target which is the main measure of blood sugar control used by doctors and this should be below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). 
The second is the HbA1c which gives an indication of average blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months and a target HbA1c is below 6.5% (the above blood sugar readings would give an HbA1c of around 6.2%). 
While these blood sugar targets are important, other factors such as kidney function, eye examinations (to check for diabetic retinopathy), blood pressure and cholesterol levels are also important in the management of diabetes. 
Regular exercise and a balanced diet are great ways to help manage type 1 diabetes and I commend your friend on this. 
However, it is important to note that exercise can affect blood sugar levels both immediately before, and after, exercising. 
A balanced diet is also great but it is important to remember that carbohydrates will immediately affect blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates can be a great source of energy but it is important to get the balance right.","100 or 120 is not steady, on the contrary, it's all over the place. A steady blood sugar would be around 80-120 or 60-120, depending on the time since the last meal. I'm not sure what you mean by ""steady at around 100 or 120"", is it mg/dL or something else? 
Anyway, the chances of complications depend on various factors, mainly:

How long has the patient had diabetes?
How well has the patient controlled his diabetes?
What are the other medical factors of the patient? (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity etc.)

Even if the diabetes was well controlled, other medical factors could cause complications. For example, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking could cause heart and blood vessel (heart, arteries, veins) complications, even if the blood sugar was perfect. 
The other factor is the duration of diabetes. The longer the patient has diabetes, the more damage is caused to the small blood vessels in the body, which can cause complications in the eye, kidney, nerves etc. 

So, to answer your question, the chances of complications arising are very high, but it depends on the factors I mentioned. If the patient has diabetes for 20 years, has high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smokes, the chances of complications are very high. On the other hand, if the patient has diabetes for 20 years, has normal blood pressure, normal cholesterol and doesn't smoke, the chances of complications are lower than a patient with uncontrolled diabetes and the other factors I mentioned. I hope it's clear.","100 or 120 after one year of diabetes is very good. Most patients will be happy with such control. The only risk is that he might develop diabetes complications over the years, which usually happen when blood sugar levels are higher. So, he should keep control like that and not relax. Also, he should have his kidney function test and eye examination (fundoscopy) regularly, as diabetes can affect these organs.","120 mg/dL is not considered to be in good control. The A1C target for most patients with diabetes, especially those who are otherwise healthy, is less than 7. The American Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends an A1C less than 7 for those without significant complications or symptoms. However, for those with significant hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or those who are at high risk for heart disease, the ADA recommends an A1C less than 6.5. Your friends sugar levels fall between 100-120 mg/dL which is not considered to be good control and he needs to work towards achieving better control.
I would suggest him to consult endocrinologist or physician who will prescribe insulin or oral anti-diabetic medications to achieve better glycemic control.","120 after one year on insulin therapy is quite good. The normal range is 70-120. The long term complications of diabetes are 

Nephropathy (kidney disease)
retinopathy (affecting vision)
neuropathy (affecting nerves)
cardiovascular disease

Your friend needs to keep checking his urine for protein, get his eyes checked regularly and have regular blood pressure checks. He needs to keep his blood pressure below 130/80 and maintain a healthy weight and healthy diet. He should not smoke and have his blood lipid profile checked regularly. He should also have his urine for glucose checked regularly."
"15 years is a long time to suffer from any condition, especially one as difficult to live with as burning mouth syndrome (BMS). I am glad to have written the article that you read, and I can assure you that we are working as fast as we can to develop a treatment for BMS. Unfortunately, I cannot predict when a treatment will be available, but my research is aimed at developing a treatment as quickly as possible. Please know that I am working hard to help people with BMS, and I hope that I can develop a treatment in the near future. Thank you for your patience and for being part of the BMS support group.","1. This is a difficult question to answer, and I can only speak in generalities.

The first challenge is for researchers to develop a consensus as to what exactly is causing BMS. As I'm sure you're aware, there are multiple theories out there, and researchers may disagree on which is the most likely.

Once a consensus is reached, researchers need to develop a way to measure the proposed cause of BMS. For example, if the proposed cause is nerve damage, researchers need to find a way to measure nerve health in patients with BMS.

Once a way to measure the cause has been developed, researchers need to develop a treatment that addresses that cause. Depending on the cause, this could be a medication, a physical therapy regimen, a change in diet or oral hygiene, or some combination of these.

Once a treatment has been developed, it needs to be tested in a clinical trial. Clinical trials take a long time, partly because they need to be meticulously designed to ensure that any results are due to the treatment being studied, and not some other factor.

Once a clinical trial has been completed, the results need to be submitted to the appropriate regulatory body, such as the FDA in the US, for approval. This can take a long time, partly because the reviewers need to work their way through many other submissions.

So you can see that, depending on how far along researchers are in understanding the cause of BMS and developing a treatment, it could be many years before a treatment is approved for use by your doctor. I'm sorry I can't be more specific.","1.Burning Mouth Syndrome is poorly understood. The exact mechanism is not known.
2.While there is no cure for BMS, there are some treatments options, but they are limited.
3.Some medications like SSRI, Gabapentin, and Pregabalin have been found to be helpful in some patients.
4.BMS is generally a self-limiting condition and most patients eventually outgrow it.
5.If you have BMS, you should see your doctor to rule out any other underlying conditions.","1. The cause of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) has not been identified. While there are many theories as to the cause, none have been proven.
2. There is no established treatment for burning mouth syndrome. The treatment options are mostly symptomatic and aimed at providing relief to the patient.

However, your research has identified a potential treatment option. In order to make it available to patients, it needs to be tested for safety and efficacy.

The first step would be to conduct animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The treatment would then need to be tested in humans in Phase I, II and III clinical trials. This is a lengthy and expensive process, and can take several years.

Once the treatment is approved by the regulatory authorities, it can be made available to patients. However, even after approval, further research may be needed to understand the treatment better and identify any potential side effects.

Therefore, it is difficult to predict a timeline for making the treatment available to patients. It could take anywhere from 5 to 10 years, or even longer.","15 years is a long time to suffer from any condition, especially one with symptoms of burning mouth syndrome. I applaud your curiosity and eagerness to learn more about how scientists are working towards a cure. Burning mouth syndrome is a frustrating condition for both patients and physicians. It often presents as a mysterious, idiopathic condition that even the most experienced of physicians struggle to diagnose and treat.  It is estimated that burning mouth syndrome affects 1-5% of the general population, but only 30-50% of patients with BMS actually seek medical attention. Of those that seek medical attention, only 50% are diagnosed accurately. That is a lot of undiagnosed burning mouth syndrome out there! The good news is that we now know that burning mouth syndrome is a real condition that can be diagnosed and treated.  The bad news is that we are not quite there yet in terms of a cure.  

When can we expect a treatment to be available that will bring us relief?

As a researcher and physician, I wish I had a definite answer for you. The truth is that we don't know. We are working on it every day, but the answer could be 6 months or 6 years. The reason I can't give you a definite answer is that burning mouth syndrome research is still in the preliminary stages. We are still trying to understand exactly what is causing burning mouth syndrome and how to target specific pathways to alleviate symptoms.  While we have learned a lot over the past several years, there is still much to be discovered. In the meantime, we will continue to study burning mouth syndrome, work towards a cure, and develop more effective treatments.","1. The treatment is not yet ready. I am still conducting animal studies to determine the safety and efficacy of the treatment. So far, the results are very promising, but it will take at least a year or two before the treatment can be tested in human clinical trials. I am working as fast as I can to get this treatment into human hands, but I am just one person with limited resources. Please bear with me."

If the patient has a primary care doctor, I would contact the PCP with the request and keep the specialist informed of the progress.
If the patient does not have a primary care doctor, the specialist can assume the role of PCP, if acceptable to the patient.

A good example of when a specialist may not be the PCP, would be a patient who has a cancer diagnosis. The oncologist is a specialist, but the primary care role falls to the internist or the hematologist, depending on the system involved. In this case, the specialist oncologist would work closely with the primary care doctor, keeping him/her informed of the treatment and testing results.","1.E-mail:

"It is not safe to stop any medication, especially psychiatric medication, abruptly. It is best to taper the dose gradually and then discontinue it.
The original form of Wellbutrin (Bupropion) has a shorter half-life and tends to have fewer and less severe withdrawal symptoms than other anti-depressants. 
However, it still is not recommended to stop taking any medication by yourself without first talking to your prescribing physician. 
If you are experiencing distressing symptoms, it may be related to withdrawal from Bupropion or from another medication you were taking. 
I would recommend that you talk to your prescribing physician or another mental health professional as soon as possible to discuss your options and to get support in making decisions about your care. 
I hope that this answer helps. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.","Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is an antidepressant medication that is commonly prescribed to treat depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and other mental health conditions. It is known to have a lower risk of sexual side effects and is often preferred over other antidepressants for this reason.

Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is typically prescribed in an extended-release tablet formulation, which is known as Wellbutrin HCL XL.

Like other antidepressant medications, it can take several weeks for the full effects of Wellbutrin (Bupropion) to be felt. Because of this, it is typically recommended to taper the medication dose rather than abruptly stop taking it.

However, in some cases it may be necessary to stop taking Wellbutrin (Bupropion) abruptly due to intolerable side effects or other medical reasons. In these cases, patients should work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.

While it is not recommended to abruptly stop taking Wellbutrin (Bupropion) HCL XL, it is not necessarily dangerous to do so, particularly if the medication has been taken for a short period of time. However, patients should be aware that it may be necessary to resume taking the medication at a lower dose after a period of time has passed.

Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is associated with a lower risk of withdrawal symptoms compared to some other antidepressant medications, but patients who abruptly stop taking the medication may experience a worsening of their original symptoms.

It is important for patients to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action when stopping any medication, including Wellbutrin (Bupropion) HCL XL.","Wellbutrin HCL XL, also known as bupropion, is an antidepressant medication that is sometimes prescribed to help people stop smoking.  It is not known to be associated with a higher risk of discontinuation syndrome compared to other antidepressant medications.  However, it is possible that abruptly stopping any medication, including Wellbutrin HCL XL, can cause uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.  The risk of this is probably lower with Wellbutrin HCL XL than with some other antidepressants, but it is still possible.  If you have stopped taking Wellbutrin HCL XL and are experiencing uncomfortable symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention right away.  A doctor can help to determine if your symptoms are related to discontinuation of the medication, and can suggest appropriate treatment options.",ChatDoctor.,"1) Abrupt discontinuation of bupropion (Wellbutrin) could lead to seizures. So, it is better to taper the dose and then stop the Chat Doctor. 2) If you have stopped taking bupropion and have experienced seizures, then it is important to report to your physician immediately. An idividual experiencing seizures may have other medical conditions that may require medical treatment.","It is not safe to stop taking bupropion (Wellbutrin) abruptly. It can cause seizures. If you decide to stop taking bupropion, you should talk to your doctor about slowly reducing your dose."

2. Eliminate entry points. Mice are small animals, and they can fit through some surprisingly small gaps. Check all of the entry points into your home and seal them up. This includes holes in the foundation, gaps around pipes and wires, and even the spaces around your garbage cans.
3. Keep the kitchen clean. Mice love to snack on food, and kitchens often have plenty of goodies available. Keep your kitchen clean and free of crumbs to prevent mice from seeing it as an attractive target.
4. Get a cat. Many people find that cats make excellent mousers. Cats will patrol your home and keep an eye out for mice, and many cats take great pleasure in hunting and killing mice.
5. Consider traps. If you can't convince a cat to take up residence in your home, you may want to consider traps. There are many different types of mouse traps available, and most work quite well. Just be sure to handle the traps safely and release the mice outside once you have caught them.
6. Call an exterminator. If nothing else works, an exterminator may be your best option. A professional exterminator will be able to identify the best methods for ridding your home of mice and put an end to the infestation once and for all.","1- Live in a clean environment,

Answer: I am very sorry to hear about your sons' condition. Wilson's disease is a rare condition even in areas with advanced healthcare facilities. I can imagine how difficult it must be to find suitable treatment options, hospitals, or medication in Mongolia, where he's the only known case. 

Since you have reached out to us, I would like to suggest that you consider two options. The first option is to get in touch with the Ministry of Health in Mongolia and find out if they can help you locate a hospital or medical center that can attend to your sons' condition. The second option is to fly to a country that has advanced medical facilities.

You will need to seek the help of his local doctor to get him stabilized enough to travel. If he is actively having seizures or unconscious then he will need to be intensive care monitored during travel.

Mongolia may not have the facilities that you desire, but it is very important to understand what disease it is and the treatment options available for that. With the limited resources available in Mongolia, there must be some treatment options available for Wilson's disease. Financial limitations are a major issue and that is understandable, but treatment options should be explored regardless of cost. I recommend you inquire at local hospitals in Mongolia and research the internet for information on the disease and possible treatment options. It would also be helpful to contact medical centers in more developed countries to inquire about costs for treatment.","24-year-old son with Wilson's disease needs medical attention.

3. If this is the case, there is a good chance that this is untreatable. There are injections that can slow the process down, but no cure.
4. I would ask her ophthalmologist to clarify this for me if I were you.","1. Based from your description, it looks like the growth in her right eye is probably an obscuring hemorrhage (blood in the eye) or an exudate (fluid in the eye from her ruptured globe).
2. If this growth is obstructing her vision, she would benefit greatly from a vitreotomy, which is an surgical procedure wherein the vitreous humor (the clear fluid inside the eye) is removed from the eye. This procedure is usually done after an eye trauma to prevent infection and scarring inside the eye.
3. Unfortunately, as she is 80 years old, her general health status has to be taken into consideration before undergoing any surgical procedure.

Or, it could be a tumor or other problem that is not amenable to treatment.

For example, cataract can make the lens cloudy and impair vision significantly. The treatment for this is cataract surgery, in which the cloudy lens is removed and usually replaced by an artificial lens.2. It is important to know what caused the retinal degeneration in the first place, for example, diabetes, hypertension, or genetic factors. These underlying causes should be controlled with medications and/or lifestyle changes.3. Also, retinal degeneration can be slowed down with specific medications, depending on the cause.4. Vision rehabilitation is another important factor. For example, low vision aids such as magnifiers can help improve vision for near tasks. Also, training the remaining good eye to see can also help. An eye doctor specialized in low vision can help with these managements.","1. I am sorry to hear about your mothers' condition.

2. Clubfoot is a congenital condition in which a baby's foot is turned inward. The exact cause of clubfoot is unknown, but it is thought that it may be caused by pressure in the womb or trauma sustained during birth. Clubfoot can usually be corrected with success rates of greater than 90%. Early treatment is the best form of prevention and is help prevent the development of arthritis and other complications later in life.

Both of these conditions are best managed by genetic counselors or healthcare providers who specialize in caring for patients with genetic disorders. The costs involved will vary depending on the testing that is performed and the care that is needed. In many cases, testing and care can be quite costly.","Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene, so it requires both parents to be carriers of the gene in order for the child to be affected. There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, and it usually leads to death within 2 years of life. There are support groups and counseling available for parents who have a child with Tay-Sachs disease.  NICHD (National Institute of Child Health & Human Development)  provides information about Tay-Sachs disease.
Clubfoot is a congenital deformity of the foot, where the foot is twisted inward. It is preventable in some cases, where preventive measures can be taken to prevent brain and spinal cord damage in the developing fetus. However, in many cases, it is not preventable. Treatment for clubfoot includes casting and physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgery may be required. There are support groups available for parents with a child with clubfoot.

2) Yes, having a family member, like my mom, with cervical cancer increases my own chances of getting the disease.","1) Long-standing or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are well-known risk factors for cervical cancer, as the bacteria that cause these infections can, over time, damage the cells of the cervix and cause abnormal changes that can lead to cancer.  

2) It is true that having a mother with cervical cancer can increase one's risk of developing cervical cancer, as patients with cervical cancer often carry the human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer. Patients with HPV infections can pass the virus on to their children, either during birth or through sexual contact, and children who become infected with HPV have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer later in life. 

The best ways to reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer if you have a family history of the disease or a history of UTIs are to practice safe sex, get vaccinated against HPV, and get regular Pap smears to detect any precancerous or cancerous changes early.","There is no proven connection between long-term bladder infections and cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is caused by a virus known as Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Your mother having had cervical cancer does increase your risk of developing cervical cancer, as you inherit certain genes from her.

Lewy body disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that results from the buildup of abnormal protein fragments (Lewy bodies) inside nerve cells. It is a form of dementia that shares features of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease usually begins with mild cognitive and motor symptoms, and later develops into behavioral and movement disorders similar to those in Parkinson's disease. The hallmark of Lewy body disease is a form of dementia that fluctuates with periods of consciousness and delirium.

It must be difficult for you. I am glad that they were able to identify a gene that is likely responsible for his condition. It can be hard to manage the symptoms of lymphedema. I have a few suggestions for you.  Has your son been taught how to properly wrap his limbs to reduce the swelling? There are specific ways to wrap depending on which limb it is. For example, if it is his leg that is swollen, he should be wrapping from the foot up, and if it is his arm that is swollen, he should be wrapping from the hand up. It is important to make sure he is doing this properly so that he doesn't cause more swelling than is already there. It is also important that he keeps the wraps clean, and changes them daily to prevent infection. If lymphedema is severe, it may be necessary for him to use compression bandages. These require a prescription and should only be used under the guidance of a lymphedema therapist or physician.  Has your son been taught how to properly care for his skin? Changing the dressings daily, and rinsing the area with saline can help keep skin infections at bay. If your son has telangiectasia, this will make him more prone to skin infections. Has your son been vaccinated appropriately? This is important to prevent infections that could be more severe in someone with his condition. Has your son been tested for protein losing enteropathy (PLE)? This is a condition that can occur in people with hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome.

"All the medical information that I have read from the CDC, Medlin and NIH all say that the symptoms presented are related to a high level of asbestos. 

I'm not sure where you're getting your information from, but the only known risk factor for asbestos is - you guessed it - exposure to asbestos. There are no genetic or other non-asbestos related causes of asbestos.
Asbestos is a mineral which was commonly used in construction before its toxicity became widely known. It is a known carcinogen and it is known to cause a number of serious diseases including asbestosis, lung carcinoma, mesothelioma and bronchitis. Because of this, doctors are often reluctant to definitively diagnose asbestos as it can cause undue stress and anxiety in patients. Instead, they may hint at its presence as you say, or provide other less definitive diagnoses such as an ""opinion of infection"" rather than outright saying ""you have asbestos"".

Why won't the doctor say it?

As stated above, doctors are often reluctant to definitively diagnose asbestos because of its carcinogenic properties. It is also important to note that the symptoms caused by asbestos are non-specific and can be indicative of a number of diseases.

If a patient presents with symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain and/or hemoptysis (coughing up blood), a doctor must first rule out life threatening causes such as lung cancer, mesothelioma and lung abscess before moving on to less serious causes such as bronchitis or asbestos. Doctors will usually order a number of tests including X-rays, CT scans, blood tests and biopsies before arriving at a final diagnosis. As you can imagine, this process can take a long time and may involve several doctor's visits.

In your particular case, your doctor may have ruled out other more serious causes and is now leaning towards a diagnosis of bronchitis. As you say, you have done your own research and have read that the symptoms you are presenting with are consistent with asbestos. If you are still concerned, you can always ask your doctor for","1. Asbestos exposure has been associated with development of various diseases including lung carcinoma, pleural plaques, asbestosis, and mesothelioma. However, not all patients exposed to asbestos develop the above mentioned diseases.
2. The diagnosis of asbestosis is based on the following findings - increased density of opacities on the chest X-ray, elevated fibrogenic tracers from the urine, and histologic confirmation from the lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage.
3. Since the symptoms of asbestos are non-specific and the disease manifests years after exposure, it becomes difficult to diagnose it definitively.
4. Hence, physicians often rely on the history of exposure to asbestos to diagnose the disease. However, since the symptoms are non-specific, they sometimes might miss the diagnosis.
5. Therefore, it is important to undergo the tests that evaluate for the presence of asbestos in the body.
6. Hence, your physician might not be willing to ""confirm"" the diagnosis without a high level of certainty. You can ask him/her to explain the reasoning or get a second opinion from another physician.","1. Asbestosis is diagnosed by clinical presentation and supported by chest x-ray and/or CT scan findings. 
  2. If your doctor isn't sure about the diagnosis, it could be because your chest x-ray/CT scan didn't show the characteristic findings (though you say the symptoms match). 
  3. It's also possible your doctor isn't finding the diagnosis likely enough to justify treating. Asbestosis is a condition that only affects people exposed to asbestos, so if the exposure wasn't recent, your doctor may be thinking the treatment isn't worth the risk. 
  4. Finally, your description of your symptoms doesn't sound like classic asbestosis to me. (I could be wrong.) 

""Classic"" symptoms of asbestosis according to the CDC: 

""Shortness of breath is the most common symptom. People with asbestosis often breathe more quickly than normal. A persistent cough is also common. Chest pain is unusual, but can occur. The pain is usually sharp, and it gets worse when taking a deep breath or coughing.
Clubbing of fingers (skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails) may occur. The fingertips may be affected as well. Nail abnormalities are also common, including a loss of the nail edge, clubbing of the fingers, and cracking and splitting of the nails."" 

""Other diseases that can cause similar symptoms are:
  - smoking (which may be a cause of shortness of breath)
  - coal worker's pneumoconiosis
  - silicosis""","1. Physicians are taught to rule out other possible causes of a given set of symptoms whenever possible.  In this case, asbestos exposure can be ruled out by a simple blood test for antibodies to asbestos.  So there is no reason to just assume asbestos exposure is the cause of symptoms.  
2. Asbestos exposure does not necessarily cause disease.  It is only an association that has been observed.  That means people with the exposure can end up sick, but also that many people with the disease never had the exposure.  So a physician can never say with certainty that a particular disease is due to a particular exposure.  That can only be proven one way or the other after the fact.
3. Asbestos litigation has been going on for decades.  In that time many people have discovered that they can make a lot of money by claiming asbestos exposure and claiming to be sick.  Physicians have seen a lot of fraud in these cases, and so are very cautious to not fall victim to it again.  They will need to see convincing evidence of exposure before they will diagnose asbestos related disease.","Asbestosis is a fibroscopic disease, so it might take years until you can be diagnosed with it. Also, there might be other diseases that can have the same symptoms, so your doctor won't just tell you 'you have asbestosis' before running some tests. The ambiguity is caused by the fact that your doctor needs to run some tests before confirming your diagnosis.","1: The CDC, Medline, and NIH are not infallible.  In fact, they're not even written by doctors.  They're written by non-physicians, often with a strong bias toward finding whatever it was that they were looking for.

2: The symptoms of asbestosis are non-specific.  In other words, they can be found in many other diseases.  Chronic cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain are all symptoms of asbestosis, but they're also symptoms of a host of other diseases, including lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, tuberculosis, and even mundane things like acid reflux.

3: Your doctor is probably looking at the results of your X-rays or CT scans.  Asbestosis causes scarring and thickening of the lungs, which shows up on those tests.  But that scarring can also be caused by a variety of other things, including (but not limited to) coal worker's pneumoconiosis, silicosis, and even radiation.

4: Diagnostic tests have a cost/benefit ratio.  In other words, there's a balance between the good that comes from diagnosing something and the bad that comes from potentially treating something that doesn't need to be treated.  That's why your doctor won't commit to a diagnosis that isn't necessary.  The fact that you've already been exposed to asbestos goes without saying.

5: Your doctor is probably looking at a list of things that are more likely to cause your symptoms than asbestosis.  That list would include (but not be limited to) smoking, exposure to other carcinogens, and even aging.

In summary, your doctor is being cautious because there are many diseases that can cause the same symptoms you have.  Your history of asbestos exposure is only part of the picture, and not the most important part.  Your doctor is looking at your symptoms, your X-rays, and your history to try to determine what's causing your symptoms.  In this case, asbestosis is only one possibility."

"94 is a pretty low number, are you sure it's correct? Anyways, to lower it, you should consult a doctor who can prescribe you some oral antihyperglycemics. You should also get a HbA1c test to keep track of your average blood glucose, and you should also get a lipid profile test to check your cholesterol. Eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly are also very important to keep your blood glucose level in check.",94 before bed and 165 in the morning is likely a sign of prediabetes or diabetes. I would recommend a diabetes diet and increasing exercise. You should also get your HbA1C checked to determine if you have diabetes or prediabetes.,"94 before bed and 165 in the morning is a very serious blood sugar spike, much higher than any other scenario I have seen so far on this forum. To put that into perspective, the average blood sugar level for someone with no diabetes is around 100-120.
You need to see a doctor immediately. This is a very serious spike, and it could indicate a number of deadly diseases. Do not delay.","94 before bed and 165 when you wake up, this could be caused by many things.  Did you eat or drink anything except water before you went to bed?  Were you active after taking your blood sugar level?  What medications are you on?  When did you last have a physical and what were the results?  Are you overweight?  How old are you?  Are you male or female?  Those are just a few questions to start with to help figure out why your levels are doing what they are doing, if you answer yes to any of those questions it could be causing your levels to rise or make you more prone to having high levels.  As a nurse, I could not give you an exact answer without knowing all the details, but I would recommend you see your doctor immediately to have these questions and more answered.  It is very important to work with your doctor to get your blood sugar levels under control, they can give you the tools you need to better manage your levels, but it takes work on your part too.  Have a great day!","94 at bedtime and 165 in the morning is suggestive of elevated nighttime blood sugars and is a common problem.  There are several things you can do to address this:

1) Check your blood sugar at other times during the night.  The reading at 12am (or whatever time you wake up in the morning) is not necessarily representative of your blood sugar levels throughout the night.  By checking at other times throughout the night, you'll get a better idea of how your blood sugar is doing overnight.  If you find that your blood sugar is elevated at other times throughout the night then you'll know that your bedtime blood sugar is also likely elevated.
2) Adjust your insulin dosage.  If you are taking insulin, talk with your doctor about lowering your evening insulin dose.  If you are on oral medications, then talk with your doctor about increasing the dose (or possibly adding a second medication).
3) Exercise.  Physical activity can help lower blood sugars.  Just be careful to check your blood sugar before and after exercise to make sure you don't drop too low.  If you do exercise in the evening, be sure to check your blood sugar after and be aware that it may be lower.
4) Eat less carbohydrates at night.  Carbohydrates can raise blood sugar levels for several hours after consumption.  If you eat a lot of carbohydrates at night, this can cause your blood sugar to rise while you sleep and then only drop back down to where it should be in the morning.  Try eating less carbohydrates at night.
5) Get your thyroid levels checked.  Problems with the thyroid can also cause elevated nighttime blood sugars.  Get your TSH level checked (and T4 if necessary).  Hypothyroidism is easily treatable.
6) Get your cortisol levels checked.  Cortisol is a stress hormone that can also affect blood sugars.  Problems with cortisol can cause elevated nighttime blood sugars.  Get your cortisol levels checked.
7) Get your iron levels checked.  Iron deficiency can cause elevated nighttime blood sugars.  Get your ferritin levels checked","94 and 165 are both abnormal readings. The cause of the spike is probably a combination of things. I would suggest a bedtime snack that contains protein and is low glycemic index. Also, a small dose of an oral hypoglycemic like glipizide 50 mg or gliclazide 80 mg should help. Check your fasting insulin level and renal function tests. Consult your doctor for more detailed information."
"Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder, and it's mostly a result of a defective gene. So, it's mostly not inherited to offspring. In rare cases, if the defective gene is on the paternal chromosome, it might be inherited to offspring.","Yes, it is possible for individuals with Angelman Syndrome to have children. However, the condition is not inherited by the offspring. Instead, the cause of Angelman Syndrome in the parents is a mutation in the gene that is responsible for the disorder. As a result, any children that the parents have will not have the condition. However, it is possible that the children may inherit other mutations or conditions from their parents that can cause disorders or health problems.","Yes, people with Angelman Syndrome can become parents, and the disorder is not always passed down to their children. In some cases, the parents may be carriers of the disorder, but not show any symptoms themselves. This means that they can have healthy children, who do not inherit the disorder. However, in other cases, the parents may be fully affected by the disorder, and pass it down to their children. It depends on the specific case, and whether the parents are carriers or fully affected by the disorder.","Yes, individuals with Angelman Syndrome are usually able to have children. The syndrome is not typically transmitted from parent to child. Instead, it is usually caused by a deletion of a gene on chromosome 15, with the maternal chromosome being the one that is deleted in around 70% of cases. There is currently no cure for Angelman Syndrome, but there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. These may include physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to help with seizure control or muscle tone.","Yes, people with Angelman Syndrome have the ability to have children, and if they do, the disorder is not heritable. The reason for this is that the mutated gene responsible for Angelman Syndrome is located on chromosome 15, and the mutation occurs randomly. This means that there is nothing to inherit, and the parents of a child with Angelman Syndrome are typically not carriers of the mutated gene. While there is a small chance that future children may also have Angelman Syndrome, it is generally not recommended for couples with a child with Angelman Syndrome to have additional children, as the likelihood of having another child with the disorder is relatively high.","Yes, a person with Angelman Syndrome can have kids, but the condition is not passed on to the next generation. Angelman Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, causing developmental delays, seizures, and a characteristic happy demeanor. The condition is caused by a lack of function in the maternal chromosome 15, which leads to a loss of the enzyme uridine methylase. This enzyme is necessary for proper brain development, so without it, the brain does not develop properly. Since the lack of uridine methylase is caused by a defect in the mother's chromosome 15, the condition cannot be passed on to any children. However, a person with Angelman Syndrome may be able to have kids, but they will not have the condition."
"1. Why do blood sugar increase in some part of body?

Blood sugar increase in body due to two main reasons:

1.  When we eat food, the food is broken down into glucose (sugar) during digestion process. The glucose then enter into our blood stream and raises the blood sugar level.

2.  Glucose is produced by liver in a process called gluconeogenesis when there is no food intake. Gluconeogenesis is an important process during starvation or fasting state.

2. Why urine bladder become more weight than any other part of body?

It is a misconception that urine bladder become more weight than any other part of body. In fact, urine bladder can't retain much water and it is constantly losing water.

Actually, the reason why urine bladder becomes prominent is because it is located in pelvic region which is one of the body fat deposits in humans. So, the urine bladder will appear more prominent in women rather than men because women have more body fat deposits than men.

Hope this answers your question. If you have any further questions, I would be happy to help.","The urine bladder is not responsible for increasing blood sugar levels in diabetes patients.  The pancreas produces insulin, which is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels.  Insulin allows glucose to enter cells, and when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body does not respond to insulin properly, glucose levels rise in the blood, leading to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 

The stomach does not play a role in regulating blood sugar levels.  However, some studies suggest that high acid secretion in the stomach can decrease the absorption of glucose in the intestines and thereby reduce the rise in blood sugar levels after a meal.  

The brain does not regulate blood sugar levels.  However, scientists are studying how the brain may be involved in signaling insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, which could lead to type 2 diabetes.  

In summary, the pancreas is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels in diabetes patients, not the urine bladder or other organs mentioned.","🤷‍♀️ I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by ""increasing blood sugar levels in diabetes patients"". The brain, stomach, and urine bladder don't play any role in regulating blood sugar levels.

Diabetes can cause weight gain, but I don't understand why you would say that the urine bladder gains more weight than other body parts. Diabetes doesn't cause the urine bladder to gain weight.

Please clarify your question, and then I can provide a more accurate answer.","The kidney is the organ that contributes to the increase in blood sugar levels in diabetes.

In diabetes, the kidneys reabsorb more glucose from the urine, thereby increasing the blood sugar levels. The urine bladder becomes disproportionately heavier due to the osmotic effect of the reabsorbed glucose, which makes the urine concentrated and heavier despite the absence of increased storage of metabolic waste products in the urine.","The brain, stomach and urine bladder are examples of organs that can gain more weight than expected due to fluid retention, which is caused by osmotic effects of high blood sugar levels in diabetes patients. The kidneys are also affected by this, and may develop conditions such as diabetic nephropathy as a result. This can lead to complications such as renal failure and can significantly reduce lifespan. It is important for diabetes patients to monitor their blood sugar levels and seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms related to these complications.","❌ INCORRECT ANSWER: The pancreas is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels in diabetes patients, not the brain or any other organ. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). The pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells and be used for energy. In diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the body does not respond to insulin properly, leading to high blood sugar levels. Diabetes can affect various organs and tissues in the body, including the brain, stomach, and urine bladder, which may experience greater weight gain compared to other body parts. However, the brain or any other organ does not ""control"" blood sugar levels in diabetes patients; only the pancreas can do that. The correct answer is 🔁."
"TMAU is a rare disorder, but it is known. It is a genetic disorder, so curing it with gene therapy is an option. There are very few known cases in medical history, though. You may also want to look into other disorders that may cause similar symptoms, such as maple syrup urine disease. That is another rare genetic disorder that can cause similar symptoms. I hope this helped as a starting point.","I'm sorry to hear that you are suffering from TMAU. It is a debilitating condition.

As you may know, TMAU is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain amino acids. This leads to the accumulation of odorous compounds in the urine and other body secretions, which give off a fishy or fecal odor.

While there is no cure for TMAU, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. These include medications that block the production of odorous compounds, as well as deodorants that help mask the smell.

Gene therapy is an intriguing approach, but it is still in the research and development stage. I cannot provide any insight into this area, as I do not have expertise in this field. However, I can provide some general information about gene therapy that may be helpful.

Gene therapy involves altering the genes inside your cells to treat or prevent a genetic disorder. It is a relatively new field, and researchers are exploring a variety of approaches, including the use of viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes into cells.

The goal of gene therapy for TMAU would be to modify the genes that control the production of odorous compounds, so that these compounds could be properly broken down. This would eliminate the fishy odor associated with TMAU.

While gene therapy holds promise for TMAU and other genetic disorders, it is still in the research and development stage. It will likely be several years before we see any clinical trials or treatment options become available.

In the meantime, there are treatment options available to help manage the symptoms of TMAU. I would encourage you to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for your individual needs.","As you have mentioned that you are suffering from TMAU, I would suggest you to get in touch with your primary care physician as soon as possible so that you can be referred to a geneticist or a dermatologist. They can guide you better as to how to go about with the investigations. 

However, I can give you a brief idea on how it can be done. Firstly, the diagnosis of TMAU has to be confirmed by a simple urine test which checks for the levels of TMA. Once that is done, a more specific test for detecting the gene mutation has to be carried out. There are two ways of doing this:

1.  By analyzing the blood sample after an oral dose of thymidine.
2.  By analyzing the white blood cells after a skin biopsy.

Once the gene mutation is confirmed, the mode of gene therapy to be adopted can be decided upon. It can be either an antisense therapy or a gene transfer therapy.

Hope you find the answer helpful. Let me know if you need any further assistance. Regards.","TMAU stands for trimethylaminuria, a rare genetic disorder that affects the way the body processes certain proteins. People with this condition can't break down certain proteins, known as trimethylamines, properly. This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the urine and sweat, causing a strong fishy or fecal odor.
  Gene therapy is a promising approach to treat wide variety of monogenic diseases including TMAU. However, there are no specific gene therapy approaches yet to treat TMAU. But the ongoing researches in this area will hopefully lead to specific gene therapy approaches in the future.
In the meantime, people with TMAU can take medications to help control their symptoms. Hydroxymethylglutaric acid (HMG) is a medication that can help reduce the odor. Speak to your doctor to see if this medication is right for you.","I'm sorry to hear you are suffering from this condition. It is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMO3 gene on chromosome 9 which leads to the inability to break down certain amino acids in protein which results in the odor you describe.

Currently there are no cures for this condition, but there are ways to manage the symptoms. Avoiding foods high in the affected amino acids such as fish and some cheeses can help reduce the symptoms. There is also a medication called clofibrate which can help reduce the symptoms by reducing the amount of oily stools.

There have been some studies involving gene therapy to potentially cure this condition. One such study was conducted in 2016 in which they were able to correct the defect in mice with the condition using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Unfortunately this research is still in its early stages and it is unlikely that a cure would be available to you in the near future.

I would continue to stay hopeful that one day there will be a cure for you and others suffering from this condition.","1. Finding the root cause of the fish-odour:
  In the first place the fish-odour has to be related to the trimethylamin-
  olefin (TMA) your body is excreting. There is another compound with a
  very similar smell, but this one is not related to the TMA metabolism. It
  is called isovaleric acid and is a metabolite of the volatile fatty
  acids that are formed in the rumen of cattle. So just avoiding beef
  won’t help. If you are a vegetarian this will be easier for you.
  Avoiding all protein food will also not help as the protein we eat are
  already in catabolized state and do not contain TMA.
  The only way to find out whether the fish-odour is related to TMA is by doing a
  urine test for TMA. If this is positive you are suffering from TMAU.
  If this test is negative you have to look for other causes of fish-odour.
  This could be a bacterial overgrowth in the intestine or a rare genetic
  disorder.

2. Treatment:
  If you are suffering from TMAU there is a good treatment option.
  This is a form of gene therapy, but it works!
  The gene responsible for this condition is the
  methylmalonyl-CoA-mutase gene (MUT).
  This gene is mutated in 75% of all TMAU patients.
  The enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA-mutase converts TMA in
  methylmalonic acid (MMA). MMA is excreted in the urine.
  So if you have a mutated MUT gene you can benefit from
  a treatment with the drug pyrimethamine.
  Pyrimethamine is normally used against malaria, but
  it inhibits the activity of the mutated enzyme in TMAU.
  This leads to a significant decrease of the TMA in the urine.
  The dose has to be adjusted individually to avoid side
  effects, but most patients can be treated successfully.

"I am sorry to hear about your brothers condition. Locked in syndrome is a rare condition where the patient is aware and awake, but cannot move or communicate due to complete paralysis. The condition results from damage to a specific part of the brain called the pons. The pons is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the brain with the spinal cord. By connecting the brain with the spinal cord, the pons allows us to initiate movements and to make our movements precise. Without the pons, a person cannot initiate any movement and the movements he does make are therefore uncoordinated and floppy. There is no cure for locked in syndrome, but treatment can help alleviate some of the symptoms. Physical therapy can help improve the patients mobility using techniques such as constraint induced movement therapy. This type of therapy involves using the patients unaffected arm to help move the affected arm. This helps to rewire the brain and improve movement in the affected arm. Other treatments include speech and swallowing therapy to improve the patients communication and swallowing skills. It is important to remember that although there is no cure for locked in syndrome, there are treatments available that can help improve the patients quality of life. Best of luck to you and your family.","I'm sorry to hear that your brother is suffering from locked-in syndrome. You didn't mention what exactly is his problem, but I'm going to list some general advices which might be helpful to you. 

Communication: Try to communicate with your brother as much as you can. Even though he is suffering from this syndrome, he is still able to understand you. Try to understand what he wants to tell you, and tell him that everything will be fine, and you will do everything in your power to help him.

Medicine: If your brother is taking some medicine, make sure he takes it regularly and in the right dosage. If you are able to, try to give him some medicine which will improve his mental health.

Physical exercise: Even though it may be hard for your brother to move, try to encourage him to do some physical exercise. It will improve his health and it will make him feel better. 

Occupational therapy: If your brother is able to, try to occupy him with some activities such as reading books, solving crossword puzzles or playing some instruments. These activities will help him to not feel depressed and they will improve his mental health. 

Visitors: Try to make your brother socialize with other people. If he is able to, take him out for a walk or invite some friends or relatives to visit him. These actions will make him feel less depressed and he will feel more energetic. 

These are some general advises which I hope will be helpful to you. I wish your brother a speedy recovery.","3 years is a very long time to be in locked in syndrome. Is he getting professional help? Is he on medication for depression, because that is surely a factor in his condition. Is he able to move at all, or is he completely locked? Has he had any therapy yet? These are all questions you need to answer before we can help you find support for him.",3 years is a long time to be in locked-in syndrome. Is he getting any therapy? Is he getting enough nutrition and fluids? Is he able to move his limbs at all? Can he feel anything? Does he have any pain? These are things you should tell the doctor so they can help him. They can't help him if they don't know how bad it is or what his needs are. It's good you are reaching out for help.,"Unfortunately, locked-in syndrome is little-understood and there are no real treatment options. Some therapies have been tried, with mixed results.

One promising approach is the use of functional neurosurgery to treat persistent vegetative state. This involves performing an elective corticectomy, in which the parts of the brain responsible for the symptoms of locked-in syndrome are identified and then disconnected from the rest of the brain. This can lead to significant improvement in the patient's condition.

Another approach is to use a brain-computer interface (BCI) to allow the patient to communicate and control devices using brainwaves. This is already being used today by some patients with severe disabilities.

Finally, physical and occupational therapy can help improve the patient's quality of life. This may include assistive devices, mobility aids, and speech therapy. The goal of therapy is to maximize the patient's ability to function and cope with their condition.","‎I am sorry to hear about your brothers condition. Locked in syndrome is a rare neurological condition in which a person is aware and awake, but cannot move or communicate due to complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for those controlling eye movement. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition, and treatment may include medication, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery. I encourage you to seek help from a neurologist who specializes in these types of conditions, they will be able to assess your brothers condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. Best of luck to you and your family."

Also, try to keep your showers lukewarm as hot showers may worsen your psoriasis.2. Medications: -High potency glucocorticoids-Vitamin D analogs (calcipotriene)-Injection of steroids directly into the scalp (depending on the severity)-Other immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin. However, these are usually for moderate to severe cases.","1. Since psoriasis is a chronic and relapsing disease, maintaining the disease in remission is the ideal treatment goal.
2. Topical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for psoriasis involving < 5% of the body surface area (BSA).
3. For psoriasis involving > 5% BSA, systemic therapy is required in addition to topical therapy.
4. Phototherapy is recommended for patients with psoriasis involving any amount of BSA who do not respond adequately to topical or systemic therapy.
5. For patients with localized palmoplanter psoriasis, topical therapy is the mainstay of treatment.
6. For patients with pustular psoriasis, systemic retinoids are recommended in addition to topical therapy, especially for patients with severe disease or those who do not respond adequately to topical therapy.
7. For patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, bacterial skin infection or the risk of complications is high, so systemic therapy is indicated as the main treatment, and phototherapy may be used in conjunction.
8. For patients with psoriasis of the scalp, the treatment is similar to those with palmoplanter psoriasis, but oral therapy is usually required in addition to topical therapy.","1. Since scalp psoriasis is a chronic and recurring condition, so before starting any treatment please make sure that you have discussed with your dermatologist about it.
2. Since scalp psoriasis can be more recurring as compared to other body parts so more emphasis is to be given on preventing relapses rather than complete cure.
3. Nowadays, targeted therapy is in trend. UV therapy is one of them. But since it has its own side effects so it should always be done under supervision of dermatologist.
4. There are some shampoos also which can help in reducing scalp psoriasis but should always be used along with some oral medicines.
5. In case of severe itching and unbearable scaling, steroids can also be used but should also be used under supervision of dermatologist.","1. Scalp psoriasis is more difficult to treat than other body psoriasis.
2. Scalp psoriasis can be treated by topical solutions that are applied directly to the scalp, such as Mildly or Moderately potent steroids (e.g. clobetasol) or Vitamin D analogs (e.g. calcitriol).
3. Systemic medications that are swallowed or injected can also be used to treat scalp psoriasis, such as Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and Biologic agents (e.g. Infliximab).
4. Scalp psoriasis may be difficult to cure, but it responds well to treatment.
5. It is important to avoid using strong medications on the scalp to prevent hair loss or other side effects."
"1. Introduction

Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I have read your question with care and understand your concerns. I will try to give you the best answer I can. If you have any further questions, I will be very happy to answer them.

2. Answer

Its always a continuum. There are mild, moderate and severe forms of many diseases. Many disorders have their genetic basis. Even if the gene causing the disease is mutated, the severity of symptoms can vary from mild to severe depending on other factors like metabolic state, co-existing pathologies etc.
That is why clinicians always try to evaluate the extent of disease in a patient by examination and investigations. This helps in deciding the treatment plan and prognosis.","It is unlikely that other siblings will exhibit more severe symptoms. Louis Bar Syndrome, also known as Bar-Ho phenomenon, is a rare genetic disorder that affects males and is caused by a mutation in the STK11 gene. 

This gene is responsible for the production of protein kinase, a protein that helps regulate cell growth and division. 

When this gene is mutated, it can cause problems with cell growth and division, which is why it is associated with reproductive issues in males. However, because the mutation is heteroplasmy, which means it is present in a mosaic pattern in the body, the severity of symptoms can vary from person to person. 

In your case, you may be exhibiting milder symptoms because you have a less severe form of the mutation, or because you have a different ratio of mutated to normal protein kinase than your siblings. It is also possible that you may not have any symptoms at all if you have a very low ratio.","1. It is possible for other siblings to have the condition, but typically it is not designated ""Louis Bar Syndrome"" if it occurs in a woman (it has to do with X-linked recessive traits). 2. It is also possible that you have subclinical symptoms of Louis Bar Syndrome (mild, without symptoms)3. I would get checked out by a gynecologist to make sure you don't have it. 4. You might have a family history, but not have the condition yourself.","It is possible that you may have inherited the mutated gene that causes Bardet-Biedl syndrome, but it is just as likely that you did not inherit the gene. Since the gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, if you do not have the syndrome then you are most likely not a carrier of the mutated gene. However, there is always the possibility that you inherited the mutated gene that does not manifest itself in any symptoms. To determine whether or not you are a carrier of the gene, you would need to undergo genetic testing. I hope this answers your question.","1) It is unlikely that siblings will have the same disorder, because it takes two copies of the mutated gene (inheritance is autosomal recessive) to develop the full blown, classic form of the disorder.
2) Even if siblings do have the mutated gene, they may not show symptoms, or may show milder symptoms because of the varying effects of the mutated gene.
3) It is also unlikely that siblings will have the same symptoms, because different mutations in the same gene can produce different effects.
4) Therefore, the best advice is to get tested if you suspect you may be a carrier of the mutated gene, because early detection and treatment can help prevent complications during pregnancy.

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","1. Louis Bar Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that only occurs in males. It is a form of muscular dystrophy. 
2. If you are a female sibling, you cannot have Louis Bar Syndrome, as females cannot inherit Bar mutations. 
3. However, you can have a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. That is why you are asked if you have a family history of Bar mutations. These can include muscular dystrophies, heart problems, neurological conditions, and various other symptoms. 
4. The fact that you have a family history of miscarriages and infant mortalities is not related to the Bar mutation, and is more likely unrelated. However, it is possible that these could be genetic conditions that are inherited, and you could be a genetic carrier like your brother. 
5. You should speak with your doctor about your family history and possible genetic testing to determine if you are a genetic carrier of any of these conditions."
"It is not clear why grinding is more prevalent in the jaw than in other muscle groups. One theory is that the temporomandibular joint derives its innervation from both the trigeminal nerve (which is responsible for motor control of the muscles of mastication) and the hypoglossal nerve (which is responsible for motor control of the tongue). The trigeminal nerve is heavily influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for ""rest and digest"" activities, while the hypoglossal nerve is influenced more by the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for ""fight or flight"" activities. The balance of control between the two nervous systems is thought to explain why grinding is most prevalent in the jaw, where the innervation is shared by both nervous systems. Future research is needed to confirm this theory. 


Another theory is that bruxism is a coping mechanism for anxiety or stress. According to this theory, clenching and grinding allow individuals to deal with stressors in a subconscious attempt to control the overwhelming emotions. This theory is supported by the finding that stress and anxiety are often associated with bruxism.","The jaw is a common location for bruxism because it is the only bony structure that remains exposed when the mouth is closed.

Bruxism is the grinding or clenching of the teeth that occurs during sleep or periods of stress. The jaw is the most common location for bruxism because it is the only bony structure that remains exposed when the mouth is closed.

The facial bones, including the cheeks, chin, and forehead, are covered by soft tissue when the mouth is closed. During bruxism, these bones may be pressed or rubbed against, leading to pain and discomfort. However, the jaw is the only bony structure that remains uncovered when the mouth is closed, making it more susceptible to the effects of bruxism.

The exact causes of bruxism are not fully understood, but stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders are commonly associated with the condition. Treatment may involve stress reduction techniques, mouthguards, or other interventions depending on the severity of the condition.","It is not a specific reason, but a combination of several reasons.

One of the common reasons is stress. People often involuntary clench their teeth when they are under stress. Most of the time, they wouldn't even realize they are doing it.

Another reason is bad alignment of teeth. If someone's teeth are misaligned, it would cause extra strain on the jaw joint and muscles, and they would clench their teeth subconsciously to compensate for the alignment.

Also, lack of sleep and sleep apnea can also contribute to the problem. When people are tired, they may clench their teeth to help them stay awake. Similarly, when people can't breathe well at night (due to obstruction like excess pharyngeal tissue or nasal obstruction), they would subconsciously clench their teeth to help them breathe.","Because jaw muscles are larger and stronger, so the forceful contractions associated with bruxism cause greater pressure on the teeth, which can damage them and cause other problems.

Bruxism is the habit of clenching and grinding your teeth, typically during sleep. It can cause pain and discomfort, as well as more serious problems like damaged teeth and headaches. The reason people experience bruxism in the jaw area specifically is because the jaw muscles are larger and stronger than those in other parts of the body, like the hands and feet, which could also be affected by tension or anxiety. Therefore, the forceful contractions associated with bruxism cause greater pressure on the teeth, which can damage them and cause other problems. Wearing a mouthguard at night or practicing stress reduction techniques may help alleviate symptoms of bruxism.","Bruxism, which refers to the habitual grinding and clenching of the teeth, is a common phenomenon that can occur in response to stress, anxiety, or other negative emotional states. However, the jaw is particularly susceptible to these types of behaviors due to its anatomical location and the complexity of its muscular structure. 

While other muscle groups, such as the arms and legs, may also be influenced by stress or anxiety, the jaw is uniquely positioned to be subject to bruxism. This is because the jaw is controlled by a complex network of muscles that interact with each other in highly specific ways. Additionally, the jaw is also closely connected to the temples and forehead, meaning that stress or anxiety can easily manifest as clenching or grinding of the teeth.

In contrast, stress or anxiety manifesting in other muscle groups, such as the arms or legs, is often less specific and more diffuse. This is because the musculature of these groups is much less complex and interconnected. As a result, while other muscle groups may also be influenced by stress or anxiety, bruxism is much more likely to occur in the jaw than in other areas of the body.","The jaw is the primary location of bruxism during sleep because it is the only bony prominence that is available to grind. The hands and feet do not have sufficient bone density to provide a similar opportunity for bruxism. Additionally, the jaw is a common site of clenching and grinding during anxiety or stress, which can further damage the teeth and TMJ."
"1) I can understand your concern for your chronic insomnia.2) As you have mentioned, the cause of insomnia is not known.3) It could be secondary to anxiety/depression/stress/work problems/relationship problems or could be due to medical problems, like thyroid problems, low testosterone, low hemoglobin, obstructive sleep apnea, etc.4) You should continue to see your psychiatrist and undergo a detailed evaluation, like physical examination, history taking and psychometric tests, to determine the possible causes.5) The treatment will be as per the cause identified.6) Wish you all the best.","40-years of age, that means you are in the middle age group, usually the causes of insomnia at this age group would be different from the causes of anxiety and insomnia. Since you already have seen a psychologist and have been recommended meditation, mindfulness and CBT for anxiety, which are good approaches, let me add one more approach for insomnia - approach for good sleep hygiene.
There are many ways to improve sleep, here I would like to discuss some of them.
1. Avoid caffeine and caffeinated products like Tea, Coffee, Green Tea, Soft Drinks, Energy Drinks etc. Caffeine is a known stimulant and is known to reduce sleep. If you are a smoker, quit smoking as smoking would also reduce sleep.
2. Avoid naps after lunch.
3. Exercise regularly but not right before bed. If you must exercise right before bed, then reduce the intensity of workout.
4. Diminish light exposure right before bed especially the ones with Blue Light like that of an LED or a Computer or a Mobile Screen. You can use Blue Light Blocking Glasses, Apps like f.lux or simply reduce time looking at the screens right before bed.
5. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.
6. Create a conducive environment for sleep. Make your bedroom quiet, dark and cool.
7. Avoid alcohol right before bed. Alcohol may make you urinate more frequently and cause disrupted sleep.
8. Avoid nicotine, caffeine and sugar right before bed. These stimulants can affect your sleep.
9. Don't worry, be happy. Stress and anxiety can affect your sleep. Try to tackle stressful situations better.
10. Avoid large meals, especially those containing a lot of fat, right before bed. Heavy meals take a long time to digest and can keep you awake.
11. Avoid stimulating activities and bright light in the evenings.
12. Don't try to judge or fall asleep. If you haven't fallen asleep after 20 minutes, get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel drowsy.
13","1. Trauma: Any kind of trauma like physical or emotional can lead to sleep disturbance.
2. Anxiety: Anxiety about future can cause disturbance in sleep.
3. Depression: Depression can cause alteration in sleep.
4. Medications: Some medications can cause sleep disturbances like stimulants.
5. Psychiatric conditions: Some psychiatric conditions can lead to sleep disturbances.
6. Substance abuse: Alcohol or any substance abuse can lead to sleep problems.
7. Medical conditions: Medical conditions like hyperthyroidism can cause sleep problems.
8. Shift work: People working in shifts can have sleep problems.","1. Chronic insomnia is a condition in which a person has difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or having non-refreshing sleep for at least one month. It can have various causes.

Social anxiety is a possible cause if it generates enough anxiety to interfere with falling asleep or staying asleep.

2. Medications are a common cause of chronic insomnia. If you are taking a medication for anxiety, it may be the cause of your insomnia.

Other possible causes of insomnia include:
- Alcohol
- Coffee
- Stress
- Poor sleep hygiene
- Medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism

It is important to determine the cause of your insomnia so that an effective treatment can be initiated. I suggest discussing the above possibilities with your psychiatrist. He/she will be able to determine if any of them are the cause of your insomnia and prescribe the appropriate treatment.","1. Psychological stress is one of the most common causes of insomnia. And social anxiety disorder is itself a risk factor.  
2. Anxiety and depression are the other major cause of insomnia. Even in cases where the individual is not diagnosed with a disorder, stress and anxiety can cause insomnia. 
3. Medical illness is another cause of insomnia. Hyperthyroidism is one such illness. 
4. Stimulants like caffeine and nicotine are major culprits. Even caffeine in chocolates can cause insomnia in susceptible individuals. 
5. Some individuals have a wrong notion that they need not sleep for 8 hours. They might boast of having worked for 2 days straight without sleep. Such thinking also causes insomnia. 
6. Alcohol. 
7. Shift work.","1. Is the insomnia associated with anxiety?
2. Have you had a sleep study?
3. Do you have any other symptoms like fatigue?
4. How long have you had insomnia?
5. What medications are you taking currently?"

"Rather than answering your question directly, I think it would be more helpful to discuss the current treatments for colon cancer, as well as how we decide which treatment is appropriate for a particular patient.

As you may know, colon cancer is a very common cancer, and treatment depends on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis.  For example, see the NCI's page on colon cancer treatment.  If the cancer is caught early, it may be removed surgically and nothing more may be needed (this is called ""curative"" surgery).  If the cancer has spread beyond the colon, it is more serious and usually requires chemotherapy as well as surgery.

It is not uncommon for patients to see ads on TV for ""miracle"" cures.  These are usually scams, and the ""cures"" they offer are usually ineffective at best (and harmful at worst).  If you are helping your father with his cancer treatment, please be careful about falling for such ads.  If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

If your father is looking for unproven treatments, I cannot help him.  If he would like to discuss the best treatment options for his particular type and stage of cancer, I would be happy to answer (his) questions about that.  Please post a question with all the details of his case, and I am sure many of the other members would be happy to provide advice.",I'm sorry but I don't watch much TV so I'm not aware of any recent TV commercials about a colon cancer cure. I'm not sure there's been a recent breakthrough in treatment to warrant a commercial. Colon cancer is usually found through routine screening and can often be cured through surgery if caught early. There is no cure for advanced stage colon cancer though and treatment then is aimed at improving quality of life.,"There is no proven cure for colon cancer, and any claim that they do have a cure should be thoroughly evaluated. Colon cancer, like many types of cancer, is a very complex and difficult disease to treat, and treatment depends on many factors, such as the stage of the cancer, the genetic makeup of the cancer cells, and the general health of the patient. Treatment options for colon cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. A combination of these treatments is often used. 

The success of the treatment depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment is associated with better outcomes. It is important to have regular check-ups and screenings, as early detection is the best cure for colon cancer. If your father has been diagnosed with colon cancer, it is important to discuss the details of his specific case with his doctor(s).","As a doctor, I can understand your concern.

Therefore, I would recommend you to undergo regular colonoscopy to detect colon cancer in the primary stages, if there is a family history of colon cancer or you are above the age of 50. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you the best of health.","There is no cure for colon cancer yet.  The five-year survival rate for colon cancer is about 65%.  The prognosis varies with the type of colon cancer and the stage of the cancer when diagnosed.

Some of the treatments for colon cancer are:

1)  Surgery: In the early stages, surgery to remove the cancerous part of the colon is possible.  This is called a colectomy.

2)  Chemotherapy: The use of cytotoxic drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells.

3)  Radiation therapy: The use of radiation to kill cancer cells.

4)  Targeted therapy: The use of monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind to cancer cells to induce cell death.

5)  Immunotherapy: The use of vaccines to enhance the immune response to cancer cells.

Your father should consult with his doctor to determine the best course of treatment for his particular type of colon cancer.","I don't know of any TV commercial that make such a claim, but I can tell you that it is highly unlikely that any such commercial would be allowed by the FDA.  The FDA would not allow a claim to be made that a specific cancer could be cured by a specific treatment.

It is important to note that no one therapy is likely to be effective for all cases of colon cancer. Treatment for colon cancer depends on the stage of the cancer, the extent of metastasis, the histology of the tumor, and other factors. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

It is possible that your father saw an advertisement for a specific therapy for colon cancer, but the advertisement would not make a claim that the therapy could cure your father's cancer.  It is important to be skeptical of any advertisements for medical treatments, especially those that make dramatic claims."
"1. Arrhythmia: A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm.  Every heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. From time to time, this electrical system can go into a chaotic pattern, which creates an abnormal heartbeat.

Arrhythmias can be of two types:

* Entrenched: when the heart beats slower than normal
* Extrinsic: when the heart beats faster than normal

Extrinsic arrhythmia can be divided into two types:

* Cardiac: when there is a problem with the heart itself
* Non-cardiac: when there is a problem elsewhere in the body

2. Heart block: When one or more of the electrical impulses that control your heartbeat does not reach the heart from the nerves that should be supplying it. There are two types of heart block:

* First-degree heart block: The electrical impulse may be delayed, but it will eventually arrive.
* Second-degree heart block: With this type of heart block some of the electrical impulses that control your heartbeats do not arrive.

Third-degree heart block: In this form of heart block, all electrical impulses are blocked.

2. Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve doesn't close all the way and blood can leak back into the left atrium during systole.
3. There are several types of mitral valve prolapse, but most people have the form in which the valve is too long and flops back into the left atrium. The chordae tendineae are the cords that attach the valve to the papillary muscles in the left ventricle. The papillary muscles contract and relax to help keep the valve closed. In mitral valve prolapse, these cords are too long and the valve doesn't close well.
4. The aortic valve is like the mitral valve, but in reverse. In aortic regurgitation, the aortic valve doesn't close all the way and blood can leak from the aorta back into the left ventricle.
5. In most cases, mitral valve prolapse and aortic valve prolapse are harmless and detected by chance on an echocardiogram performed for another reason.
6. Most of the time there is no problem, but in some instances, the valve doesn't close all the way and blood can leak back into the left atrium or ventricle. This leads to mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.
7. In some cases, a person with mitral valve prolapse or aortic valve prolapse can have problems with blood clots in the heart. Blood clots in the heart can lead to a stroke if they travel to the brain. Blood clots in the heart are called a pulmonary embolism when they travel to the lung. Blood clots in the heart can be treated with medications that thin the blood.

This leads to mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation","1) In a routine stress echocardiogram, the patient is given a medication called dobutamine, which mimics the effect of exercise on the heart. The echocardiogram is then evaluated to see if the heart is responding well to the medication.

2) An electrocardiogram is a basic and essential test done to diagnose any kind of heart abnormality. It records the electrical activity of the heart and shows any abnormalities.

3) Exercise stress testing is a cardiological test which is given to patients having abnormalities in their routine stress echocardiogram. During this test, the patient is made to exercise by making them run on a treadmill while their ECG and echocardiogram are continuously recorded.

I hope this answers your question.","1) For Wolff-Parkinson-White: There is a risk of abnormal heart rhythms, so an electrocardiogram (ECG) is done to detect it. An ECG is a simple and painless test which records the heart's electrical activity. To further test this condition, a cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) may be done. It helps to detect the type of accessory pathway and the best method to treat it. Some patients with WPW syndrome can have a dangerous arrhythmia called paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia. In these at risk patients an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be indicated.
2) For LGL syndrome: This condition can be detected on an ECG. A cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) may be done to further test this condition."
I am sorry to hear that. What was the stroke and what were you told was the cause?  There are some new treatments that may help you.  Please send me a direct question.,"There are various types of stroke and thus responses to them vary. What I can tell you is that the brain is very plastic and can rewire itself around damaged areas. This is used therapeutically in areas of the brain that are responsible for language (Broca's area) and movement (pre-motor and motor cortex).  Hemiplegia can be reduced by retraining the brain to use the other half of the body.

In cases of Broca's and Wernicke's area strokes, language therapy is useful. Aphasia is the technical term used to describe the inability to use or understand language. Conductive language therapy is useful as is repetitive speech therapy.

In cases of more widespread strokes that affect more than one area of the brain, the focus is on retraining the body for everyday living. This can include learning to use a wheelchair or a cane, retraining in the use of the unaffected side of the body, and retraining in the use of the arms and legs. Task-specific training is also used. For example, if you like to play golf, practice at that. 

As you can see, there are many approaches to recovering from a stroke. The key is to never give up.","1. In cases of stroke the most important factor is the time from onset of symptoms to treatment, we call it ""time is brain""
2. There are two types of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. The treatment will depend on the type of stroke
3. For ischemic stroke, the medications that are given within 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms are aspirin and tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), while after 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms and until 24 hours, a medication called streptokinase is given
4. For hemorrhagic stroke the medications given are mannitol, an anticonvulsant, and corticosteroids
5. The prognosis for stroke is very dependent on the time to treatment, the earlier the better
6. There are new therapies such as thrombectomy, which can be used for ischemic stroke if performed within 24 hours of onset of symptoms","1. Based on the available evidence, there is no clear alternative to the conventional rehabilitation for stroke. 

2. Globally, the WHO recommendations for stroke management is as follows: 
a. Underlying risk factors be controlled such as hypertension, diabetes. b. Early management of ischemic stroke c. Rehabilitation of the patient d. Prevention of another stroke e. Management of complications","1. Based on my research, I think it is important to rule out any contraindications to physical therapy. It is important to consult with a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment.
2. I would suggest you to go through a neurological evaluation to assess the extent of the nerve damage caused by the stroke.
3. Also, it is important to be evaluated for any joint inflammation, muscle weakness, muscle imbalance, and postural alignment issues.
4. After that, an individualized treatment plan will be developed which may include physical therapy, massage therapy, TENS therapy, and/or ultrasound therapy.
5. As far as the best course of action is concerned, it is important to follow the treatment plan as prescribed by the physical therapist.
6. Your compliance to the treatment is crucial in order to achieve the best results.
7. Stay positive and keep a smile on your face. It will help speed up your recovery process.
8. I hope this helps. I wish you a good health. Thank you.","1. Based on your description, I would recommend you to try out other types of therapy like - constraint-induced movement therapy or virtual reality therapy or mirror therapy or telerehabilitation. 
2. Also make sure that the veteran is not having any undiagnosed sleep disorder, as that might be contributing to the problem. 
3. A cane or a walker might help with balance while walking.

This will help to reduce the pressure on the back of your heel and prevent further irritation. You may also need to change the type of shoe you wear, avoiding high heels and instead opting for flat, flexible shoes. Stretching your calf muscles may also help to reduce tension in the muscles that can contribute to this condition.

In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bony growth causing the deformity.","Haglund's deformity of the calcaneum, also known as a ""pump bump"", is a common condition that occurs when the back of the heel becomes irritated from shoes that are too tight, heavy, or poorly fitted.  The bone at the back of the heel, called the calcaneus, becomes swollen and inflamed as a result. Treatment for Haglund's deformity includes wearing more comfortable shoes, especially those with a wider toe box, heel lift, or air cushion; avoid standing for long periods of time; and use ice and anti-inflammatory medications to help reduce swelling.  If these treatments are not effective, see a foot doctor to rule out other more serious conditions.","Haglunds deformity, also known as a prominence of the heel, is a common condition that can be treated conservatively with success.

The first thing you should do is to change your exercise routine. Squatting, climbing stairs and running, should be reduced until the problem improves. 

You should also try to avoid wearing anything that may be tight around the heel. Such as, shoes, boots or high heels. 

If none of these options help, then you should see a doctor, who may prescribe anti-inflammatory medication, which can help reduce pain and swelling. In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove the bony prominence.","Haglund's deformity is a problem with the bone in the heel of the foot, and it can cause pain and difficulty walking.  Here are some steps you can take to cope with this condition:

1) Rest.  Give your foot the time and opportunity it needs to heal.  Reduce your physical activity level, avoid vigorous exercise, and stay off your foot as much as possible.  This kind of rest will also help to reduce inflammation.

2) Ice.  Apply ice or a cold compress to your foot several times a day.  This will help to reduce pain and inflammation, and it will also promote healing.

3) Elevate your foot.  When you're not walking on it or using it, elevate your foot above the level of your heart.  This will help to reduce swelling.

4) Use a heel lift.  A heel lift will elevate your heel and shift your weight forward, reducing the pain and discomfort associated with Haglund's deformity.  You can buy heel lifts at most pharmacies.

5) Stay in shoes.  Even when you're not walking, be sure to stay in your shoes as much as possible.  This will keep your foot supported and reduce the risk of further injury.

6) Stretch your calf muscles.  Tight calf muscles can contribute to the development of Haglund's deformity, so it's important to stretch them.  Ask your doctor or a physical therapist to show you how.

7) Strengthen your ankles.  Strong ankles can help to prevent further damage to your foot.  Do ankle wobbler exercises or use a wobble board to strengthen your ankles.

8) Consider physical therapy.  In some cases, physical therapy can help to reduce pain and improve mobility in the affected foot.  Ask your doctor for a referral to a physical therapist.

9) Consider surgery.  In severe cases of Haglund's deformity, surgery may be necessary to remove bone spurs or correct the shape of the heel bone.  Discuss surgery with your doctor.

"1. There is a lot of information in the literature about Williams Syndrome.  You can start with the National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov) and search for Williams Syndrome.  There are also a number of very good books about Williams Syndrome for parents and professionals.
2. I am not sure what you mean by tips on how to educate people with Williams Syndrome.  Williams Syndrome is a genetic condition with a variety of symptoms.  These symptoms often respond to highly structured, specialized educational programs that are designed to address the unique learning styles and abilities of those with Williams Syndrome.  Many of these programs incorporate music and art into the academic curriculum.  There are a number of schools around the country that specialize in teaching children with Williams Syndrome.","*Parents usually suspect a problem long before a diagnosis is made.
*Williams syndrome is an inherited condition. This means it is caused by problems with genes. Researchers think the gene involved is located on chromosome 7. *Williams syndrome is very rare. It occurs in about 1 out of every 7,500 people. *Most of the time, the parents of a person with Williams syndrome do not have the condition. But sometimes, a parent may have a mild form of it.","1. Williams syndrome (also Williams-Beuren syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive, ""elfin"" facial appearance, along with a low nasal bridge; an unusually cheerful demeanor and ease with strangers, coupled with unpredictably occurring negative outbursts; mental retardation coupled with unusual (for persons who are diagnosed as mentally retarded) language skills; a love for music; and cardiovascular problems, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis and transient hypercalcemia. 

It is thought to occur in one in 7,000 people. The syndrome affects the whole body (the heart, face, hands, feet, and rest of the body), but not in all people to the same degree.

Most often, it is caused by a random deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7 (specifically from the long arm of the chromosome, known as q long arm). This deletion is approximately 150 genes in size. Approximately 70% of these genes are functionally important (non-duplicated) genes, and the remaining 30% are duplicated (extra copies of genes that are present in both copies of the chromosome). The duplicated genes do not cause the syndrome, as these extra copies of genes are not expressed in the affected individual. The cause of cardiovascular symptoms is well understood and does not involve the genes missing in the deleted segment.

The symptoms of Williams syndrome are caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 7. The genes that are missing from theaffected individuals'chromosome 7 are highly conserved, which means they are essential for life. The genes that are still present in his or her genome are also important. They are involved in programmed cell death, embryonic development, and the immune response.

The genetic cause of Williams syndrome has been identified. It is characterized by a congenital microdeletion of 7q chromosome (long arm). Most of the genes in this region of the chromosome are involved in neuronal function. The critical region for the expression of the syndrome lies between the SHOX","Williams syndrome (also Williams-Beuren syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive, ""elfin"" facial appearance, along with a low nasal bridge, an unusually cheerful demeanor and ease with strangers, coupled with unpredictably occurring negative outbursts.
It is caused by a congenital microdeletion of chromosome 7q (long arm, q11.2→q21.1), which scientists believe occurred approximately 500 years ago.  Although there are around 300 reported cases in the literature, there are probably many more undiagnosed people with this syndrome.
Most children with Williams syndrome make a good recovery, although long-term intellectual impairment is common.","1. Williams syndrome (also Williams-Beuren syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive, ""elfin"" facial appearance, along with a low nasal bridge, an unusually cheerful demeanor and ease with strangers, coupled with unpredictably occurring negative outbursts.  

The intellectual disability (although not as severe as in Down syndrome) is coupled with a unusual (for an autosomal dominant disorder) concentration of problems in cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and mental health. 

2. Most of the affected population is caused by a random de novo mutation, because it occurs so early in development (first 3-4 weeks after conception).  This means there are no carriers in the family, and the risk of having a second child with the syndrome is the same as the general population (i.e. sporadic).

Hysterectomy: It is the surgical procedure involving the removal of uterus. It is indicated in patients who do not respond to medical treatment and have heavy bleeding.","1. Adenomyosis is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus becomes enlarged, causing the uterus to become bulky and causing pain.

2. Hysterectomy is the most common treatment for adenomyosis. During a hysterectomy, your surgeon will remove your uterus in its entirety.

3. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries. This is done if you have suffered from other conditions related to your reproductive system, such as ovarian cysts or endometriosis.

4. Your doctor may also recommend a dilation and curettage (D and C) as a treatment for adenomyosis. In this procedure, your doctor will dilate your cervix and remove tissue from your uterus using a scraping instrument.

5. GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide, may be used as a treatment for adenomyosis. These medications work by suppressing the production of estrogen, which can help to shrink the uterine tissue.

6. If you have mild symptoms of adenomyosis, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting. This means that you will be monitored closely for any changes or progression of your condition, but that no active treatment will be performed.

"1. Can you tell if your child will have achondroplasia when you are pregnant? 
No. The only way to determine if a child will have achondroplasia is through genetic testing after birth.

2. When do people usually come in when they think something isn't right with their child?
Parents may notice that their child is growing more slowly than other children the same age and may become concerned that their child has achondroplasia. However, there are many other reasons for a child's delayed growth, so parents will often wait until their child is at least 2 years old before seeking medical help.

3. What are the worse cases of achondroplasia you've ever seen?
I have seen patients with achondroplasia reach an adult height of less than 4 feet (~120 cm). The average adult height for people with achondroplasia is around 4'3"" (~130 cm).",Achondroplasia is mainly prenotically diagnosed through ultrasonography. The average age of parents seeking medical attention when they suspect developmental issues in their child is around 3 years of age. The most severe cases of Achondroplasia I have encountered were those who had a profound mental retardation.,"It is possible to prenatally diagnose achondroplasia if the parents are both carriers of the recessive gene. However, if the parents are not known to be carriers, it is not possible to prenatally diagnose.

Parents typically bring their child to see a doctor when they are concerned about their development, particularly if their child's height and weight are significantly different from other children the same age.

I have seen extreme cases of achondroplasia where the child's height was less than 10 inches and weight was less than 5 pounds. These cases required extensive medical attention and surgical interventions.","Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder which is inherited as an autosomal dominant. Diagnosis of this can be made by examination of the patient and family history. It can be diagnosed prenatally by measuring the amniotic fluid or by performing a chorionic villus sampling. The decision to seek medical help is usually based on the parents concerns about the child's development. The severe form of achondroplasia is achondroplasia dwarfism which is characterized by extremely short stature and a large head. Most affected individuals are over 100 cm in height. Other severe manifestations include respiratory, spinal cord and brain stem problems.","Achondroplasia can be detected during pregnancy by measuring the femur length of the fetus in the womb, using an ultrasound. The test is about 90% accurate.

Parents typically seek medical attention when they have concerns about their child's development. In the case of achondroplasia, the child may have abnormal bowed legs and short stature even at birth.

Some of the most extreme cases of achondroplasia I've seen involve children who have had their growth delayed until after age 2. This is called a growth hormone deficiency. These children have had nearly normal childhoods, and then suddenly begin growing at a very rapid pace. I've seen children who were only 3 feet tall at age 10, grow to be 6 feet tall by age 18. It's remarkable!

It's important to remember that achondroplasia is a genetic disorder, and so many other factors can affect the child's health as well. If you have any concerns about your child's development, it's important to speak with your doctor.","Achondroplasia can be diagnosed prenatally by measuring the transverse diameter of the long bones, specifically the femur. Parents typically become concerned about their child's development and consult with a doctor when they observe their child is growing at a different rate compared to their peers.

"1) If you don't know for sure, then you probably haven't had it.  Chicken pox is a common, highly contagious childhood disease.  Adults who get chicken pox are usually immunosuppressed (elderly, HIV, malignancy, etc.)  2) You can ask your doctor for a blood test to determine if you have been exposed to the virus (VZV).  This is not a definitive test for current infection, but if you have been exposed, the likelihood is that you would be protected from getting it again (and thus, would be a candidate for the shingles vaccine).","1) If you are not sure if you had chicken pox in the past or not, then the best way to confirm is to get a blood test to check for antibodies for the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chicken pox.
  2) You can also get a physical examination by your healthcare provider, who will check for any scars on your body which are a typical sign of having gone through the disease.
  3) Your healthcare provider may also ask you about any possible exposure to the virus, such as having taken care of someone with chicken pox or being in close contact with someone who was contagious.
  4) If you have already gone through chicken pox in the past, then getting the shingles vaccine is a good idea, since it can still help prevent you from getting shingles, and if you do develop shingles, it is likely to be less severe.","The best way to determine if you have had chickenpox is to talk to your health care provider. 

Your health care provider can review your medical history or order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to the virus. If you or your child is not sure whether he or she has had chickenpox, it is important to consult your health care provider to determine if vaccination is still recommended.","Question: Is there a way to determine if I've had chicken pox, and if so, what do the test results need to show in order for me to know if I've had it, which will help me decide about the shingles vaccine?

Answer: Yes, there is a way to determine if someone has been exposed to chicken pox. A blood test for the varicella titer will show if someone has been exposed or if they have immunity to the virus. The test will show if levels of antibodies to the virus are in the protected range. This information would be helpful in determining if someone needs the shingles vaccine. If the blood test shows levels of protective antibodies, then the person has immunity to the virus and may not need the vaccine. Additional information about varicella titer testing can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingles-vaccine/should-get-vaccine.html.","1. If you do not have a history of chicken pox or have not had the vaccine you can get a blood test to check for antibodies.
2. If you are unsure whether or not you have had chicken pox, it is recommended that you get the vaccine. The varicella zoster vaccine (Zostavax) is recommended for individuals 60 years of age or older, or individuals who are at high risk and did not have chicken pox or receive the vaccine as a child. The vaccine can help prevent severe shingles attacks.
3. To check for antibodies, a blood test can be done to check for antibodies. The test is called the VZV serology blood test. The test checks for antibodies to the virus that causes chicken pox (varicella zoster).
4. If the blood test shows that you do not have antibodies to the virus then you are considered to be unprotected and at risk for shingles. Therefore, it is recommended that you receive the vaccine.
5. It is important to talk with your doctor about your medical history and any concerns you may have about receiving the vaccine.","1) If you are not sure if you had chicken pox in the past or not, you can get a blood test to check for antibodies against the virus.
2) If you have had chicken pox in the past, the blood test will show antibodies against the virus, indicating a past infection.
3) If you have not had chicken pox in the past, the blood test will show no antibodies against the virus, indicating you are not immune to the virus.

(Note: The shingles vaccine is only effective if you have not had chicken pox in the past. If you have had chicken pox in the past, the vaccine may still be effective in reducing the severity and duration of shingles, but it is not 100% effective in preventing the disease. The decision to get the vaccine is based on many factors, including your age, overall health, and immune status, and should be discussed with your healthcare provider.)"

You should direct the patient to seek medical attention immediately.","""I think we should reconsider this decision to ensure safety."""
"1. Minoxidil: This medication is approved to treat male-pattern baldness. It can help to regrow hair and prevent further hair loss. Minoxidil is applied directly to the scalp and is available without a prescription. Men with scalp hair loss can apply minoxidil twice a day. Women should talk to a doctor before using minoxidil.

2. Finasteride: This medication is also approved to treat male-pattern baldness. Finasteride can help regrow hair and prevent further hair loss in men. Like minoxidil, finasteride is applied directly to the scalp and is available without a prescription. Women should consult a doctor before using finasteride.

3. Hair transplant: During a hair transplant, a plastic surgeon removes hair-producing follicles from the back and sides of the head and injects them into bald or thinning areas. Hair transplants can be expensive and may require several procedures.

4. Scalp reduction: This surgical procedure removes a bald scalp and hairless area and closes the exposed area. Scalp reduction may be done in one procedure or in several procedures, depending on the severity of baldness.

5. Low-level laser therapy: This therapy uses light to stimulate hair growth. A doctor will use a hand-held device to apply low-level laser energy to the scalp. Low-level laser therapy may be used alone or with other treatments, such as minoxidil or finasteride.

6. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP): During this procedure, blood is drawn from the patient and placed in a machine that separates the platelets from the blood. The concentrated platelets are then injected into the bald or thinning area of the scalp.

7. Cosmetic surgery: Cosmetic surgery is an option for some people with hair loss. During surgery, a plastic surgeon removes a flap of skin and hair-producing follicles from the back and sides of the head and attaches it to the bald or thinning area.

8. Wigs and hairpieces: Wigs and hairpieces are an option for people with hair loss. Wigs can be made from natural or synthetic hair and can","""I'm currently bald and resemble Dr. Evil""

As a doctor, I can understand your concerns and I assure you that there are solutions for a beautiful hair.

First, you should know that minoxidil is an effective treatment for male-pattern baldness. It lengthens the anagen phase and thus, new hair growth occurs. It also opens potassium channels and thus, increases ATP levels in hair follicles. However, it may take up to 4 months before you see results and up to 12 months before you see the maximum benefit.

Second, Finasteride is another treatment that interferes with DHT action. It is also known to be effective in preventing further hair loss and promoting hair regrowth.

Third, there are other options like Alopecia which is a disulfide that is obtained from the urine of cattle. It has been used to treat baldness caused by ringworm and is also effective against other dermatophytes. It is applied topically.

Fourth, there is Minoxidil and Finasteride combination which is more effective than minoxidil alone and comparable to finasteride alone. It has the same mechanism of action as minoxidil and finasteride.

Fifth, in case of severe hair loss, you may be prescribed Oral Finasteride.

However, if your hair loss is caused by a serious condition like thyroid disease, vitamin deficiency, autoimmune disorders or hormonal imbalances, you should first treat the underlying condition.

In conclusion, there are solutions for a beautiful hair. You should first consult a doctor in order to determine the underlying cause of your hair loss and then, start the treatment. Minoxidil and Finasteride are effective treatments. In case of severe hair loss, you may be prescribed Oral Finasteride. Other options like Alopecia are also effective.","1) Your question made me chuckle.
2) There are many causes of male pattern baldness. The most common is Androgenic Alopecia, which is basically genetic. You may want to check out this article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23051726
Minoxidil (Rogaine) is approved for use by men to regrow hair and prevent further balding. It works by dilating blood vessels in the scalp, thus, promoting hair growth.
However, if your hair loss is not Androgenic Alopecia, then you may need to be seen by a dermatologist or endocrinologist to determine the cause of your hair loss.
Hope that helps!","Unfortunately, there is no cure for male pattern baldness. However, there are treatments out there that can assist in regrowing your hair, given your current bald state and uncanny resemblance to Dr. Evil. One such treatment is called ""Minoxidil,"" which is applied directly to the scalp and works by stimulating hair growth. Another treatment is called ""Finasteride,"" which is taken orally and works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the hormone that causes hair loss. 

It's important to note that Minoxidil and Finasteride are not cures for male pattern baldness. They can only slow down or stop your hair loss, and won't regrow your hair. They only work for as long as you continue to use them. In addition, they only work on certain types of hair loss, so be sure to consult your doctor to see if these treatments are right for you. If these treatments don't work for you, there are other options such as hair transplants, wigs, and toupees, although I recommend trying the Minoxidil or Finasteride first. 

Remember, there is no cure for male pattern baldness, but there are treatments available that can assist in regrowing your hair, given your current bald state and uncanny resemblance to Dr. Evil.","1) Your question is somewhat vague.  I can only assume that you mean ""bald"" as in ""lacking hair"" and not as in ""have an unusually large head."" If it's the latter, I can't help you.

2) Hair does not grow on the scalp.  Hair grows on the follicles of the scalp.  So if you want hair on your scalp, you need to find a way to make the hairs that are already there grow.  If the hairs aren't growing, it's because the follicles aren't working.  There are a number of reasons why follicles may not be working, including disease, malnutrition, stress, and genetics.  If you just started being bald recently, it's probably a stress-related condition called Telogen effluvium.  If you've been slowly going bald for a while, it's probably Male Pattern Baldness, which is largely a genetic condition.  If you have some other disease, the answer will depend on what that disease is.  I can't diagnose over the internet, so you'll need to see a real doctor for that.

3) If the problem is Male Pattern Baldness, there are a couple of FDA-approved medications that you can get with a prescription that will help your hair to grow.  They work by blocking the effects of DHT, which is the hormone that causes hair to recede.  However, they don't work for everyone, and they do have side effects, so you'll have to decide if the potential benefits are worth the potential risks.  If you have other types of hair loss, there are also hair growth products on the market that may or may not work.  I can't recommend any particular product, because I don't think any have been proven effective in clinical trials.

4) If the problem is stress-related, the best thing you can do is to find out what is causing the stress and deal with it.  In the meantime, there are also stress-reducing techniques that may help you to feel better and reduce the amount of stress that you are under.  I can't recommend any particular technique, because different things work for different people.

5) If you have some other disease, the answer will","1) Minoxidil
  Minoxidil is the only FDA -approved product proven to regrow hair and prevent further hair loss. Available as a 5% solution, it is applied topically to the scalp twice daily. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles. Results will not be immediate and may take up to 4 months to see any results. After that, you must continue using minoxidil or the effect will fade.

2) Finasteride
  Finasteride is another FDA approved product for the treatment of male pattern baldness. Available as a 1 mg tablet, it is taken orally once a day. Finasteride works by blocking 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, a hormone that is involved in the development of male pattern baldness. Results will not be immediate and may take up to 2 years to see any results. After that, you must continue taking finasteride or the effect will fade.

3) Hair Transplant
  Hair transplant is a surgical procedure that moves hair-producing follicles from the back and sides of the head to bald or thinning areas. The follicles are then injected directly into the bald areas. Results are immediate and will continue to improve as the transplanted hair grows. Recovery time is relatively quick, with some minor pain and discomfort. Scarring is usually minimal and hidden by the existing hair. Since the procedure is invasive and can be expensive, it is not recommended as a first option and is usually reserved for more severe cases.

4) Laser Therapy
  Low-level laser therapy uses light energy to stimulate blood flow in the scalp, which in turn nourishes the hair follicles. Results are usually not immediate and may take several months to see any results. Since this is still a new procedure, there are no established standards for the dosage or duration of treatment, so it may vary from clinic to clinic.

5) Cosmetic Prosthetics
  Cosmetic prosthetics include wigs, hairpieces and surgical implants. Wigs offer the most versatility in style and color, but can be expensive and may not always"

The financial burden on families can be tremendous. In addition to the cost of medical care, families may require additional support for adaptive equipment, physical therapy, and behavioral therapy. There may also be lost wages from taking time off work to care for their child. Families may also require help from social services for things like housing modifications or help with grocery shopping or cooking.

DMD is a devastating disease for both the affected individual and their families. While there have been advances made in understanding the genetic basis for the disease, there is still much work to be done to develop effective treatments. It is important to support the research community in their efforts to develop new treatments and ultimately a cure for DMD.","1. Inheritance Pattern:
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive trait. This means that the mutated gene responsible for the disease is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, so if the mother is a carrier of the mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that each of her male children will inherit the disease. Males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene from their mother, they will develop DMD.

-Progressive muscle weakness
-Difficulty walking, running, and jumping
-Cognitive and behavioral problems
-Difficulty with motor skills
-Shortness of breath
-Frequent falls

-Government assistance available for qualifying families
-Legal assistance available for estate planning and special needs trusts
-Gene therapy and stem cell replacement experimental treatments not covered by","1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means that a child needs to inherit the defective gene from both parents to be affected by the condition. Unfortunately, this is often the case with genetic disorders.
2. DMD is characterized by muscle weakness, which manifests as difficulty with motor skills and walking. Eventually, the muscle degeneration affects the heart and lungs, leading to heart failure and breathing difficulties.
3. There is currently no cure for DMD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. This can include physical therapy to improve motor skills and mobility, medications to help manage symptoms such as muscle spasms, and assistive devices such as wheelchairs and braces.
4. One support group for families affected by DMD is Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, which provides information about the condition, funds research, and assists families with support groups and advocacy.
5. The cost of treating DMD can be significant, with medical and therapy treatments, medications, and assistive devices all contributing to the financial burden. In addition, families may need to make modifications to their homes to accommodate wheelchairs and other assistive devices.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects mostly males and it's mode of  inheritance is autosomal recessive. Symptoms include rapidly progressive weakness, fatigue, and difficulty walking. There is no treatment available that has been shown to halt or reverse the disease, but medications can help to manage symptoms. Support groups include Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Parent Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights, and MDA (Muscular Dystrophy Association). Duchenne muscular dystrophy places a significant financial burden on families due to the cost of medical care, physical therapy, and special education. I hope this helped.","1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder
  affecting approximately 1 in 3,600 male infants. It is
  incompletely penetrant, variably expressive, and usually
  manifests in early childhood. 
2. Most commonly, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is
  inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means
  that the mutated gene responsible for the disorder is located
  on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes). 
  In about 10% to 25% of cases, the mutation occurs on the
  Y chromosome, which is the other sex chromosome.
  Because males have only one X chromosome and two Y
  chromosomes, they are more likely to be affected by
  X-linked recessive disorders than are females.
3. The condition results in rapidly worsening skeletal
  muscle weakness, leading to difficulty with walking,
  wheelchair dependence, and, eventually, respiratory
  failure. Death usually occurs by age 25.
4. Careful monitoring and treatment of symptoms can
  improve the quality of life for patients with Duchenne's
  muscular dystrophy.
5. Families affected by Duchenne's muscular dystrophy
  incur significant financial burdens for medical care,
  physical therapy, and specialized wheelchairs.
  Government agencies, foundations, and private donations

The surgery will remove the herniated disc and fuse the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine.  This is considered effective but there are some risks.
2. Physical therapy - Physical therapy can be very effective in treating a herniated disc.  The focus will be to increase core strength and back muscle strength to support the spine and prevent future herniation of the discs.  The therapy can also teach you how to properly lift and move so as not to aggravate the injury.
3. Anti-inflammatory medication - Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen can be helpful in reducing pain and inflammation in the affected area.  These medications can be helpful in the short term but should not be used long term due to potential side effects.

"Well, it depends on the type of cancer and the phase in which it is detected. Also, the type of treatment plays a role in it. But generally, the prognosis is good after treatment and the 5-year survival rate is also an indicator of it. Here, I have attached a table depicting the 5-year survival rate of different cancer types.

However, it might be possible that the cancer might recur at a later stage. But that would depend on various other factors. Nonetheless, the treatment for cancer has been improving over the years and the 5-year survival rate has also been increasing.

Hence, the prognosis after cancer treatment depends on various factors and the 5-year survival rate is an indicator of it.","1. Relapse:

It depends on the type of cancer and the stage at which it is detected. Also, the period for which the cancer treatment was carried out plays a role in determining the possibility of relapse.

2. Life Expectancy:

After completion of cancer treatment, the life expectancy depends on the stage of cancer at the time of detection. Also, the duration and effectiveness of cancer treatment play a role in determining the life expectancy of a person after cancer.","It is possible for cancer to return, this is called a relapse. How long they can survive after that depends on the type of cancer and the person's overall health. Some people can survive for a long time after a relapse, others for a short time. Cancer relapses can be caused by many things, including changes in the cancer cells that make them resistant to treatment, or changes in the immune system. There is also the possibility that the cancer never truly went away after treatment, but was in a state of remission where it was too small to detect. If you have any concerns about this possibility, you should talk to your doctor.","1. Cancer treatment is given to destroy or remove cancer cells from the body. 

2. Depending on the type and stage of cancer, treatment duration may vary. 

3. After completion of treatment for most of the cancers, follow-up is advised at regular intervals to check for any recurrence. 

4. The average lifespan of a person after completion of cancer treatment depends on various factors like type and stage of cancer, treatment received, age and general health of the person. 

5. The chances of recurrence can be reduced by regular follow-ups and early detection of cancer recurrence. 

6. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and good follow-up to improve the quality of life after cancer treatment.","1. Treatment for cancer involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. 
2. The chances of cancer recurring depends on the type of cancer, stage at diagnosis, treatment received and the patient's general health. 
3. After successful treatment, the patient is doing well and the cancer is in remission, the chances of recurrence depends on the type of cancer. 
4. For example, the 5-year relative survival for breast cancer is 90.6% while for lung cancer it is 19.2%. This means that 90.6% of women with breast cancer survive for at least 5 years after diagnosis, while 19.2% of women with lung cancer survive for at least 5 years after diagnosis. This is because breast cancer is more treatable than lung cancer. 
5. The length of remission can vary widely depending on the type of cancer, the stage at diagnosis and the treatment received.

Interpretation: The patient is a transgender woman with HIV infection.
Therapy for HIV infection is complex, and it depends on many factors, such as the viral load, the CD4 count, the genetic type of HIV (drug resistance), the general status of the patient, etc.
Therefore, please consult your doctor, and he/she will determine the proper therapy for your specific case.","1. What are some healthy tips you've learned while living with HIV/AIDS?
2. What challenges do you face when trying to access high-quality care?
3. Are there any resources you'd recommend for other HIV-positive transgender women who are looking for support?","As an HIV specialist, I'd suggest you:

1. Start with the basics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a wealth of easily understandable information on HIV, including how the virus is transmitted, tested for, and treated.

2. Learn about the different types of HIV tests. The CDC recommends three types of tests:


* Rapid tests: results are available in a few minutes.

* ELISA tests: these are more accurate but results take a few days.

* Western blot tests: used to confirm ELISA test results.


3. Find out about HIV medications. HIV medications, or antiretroviral therapy (ART), are the primary treatment for HIV. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), there are currently two types of medications used to treat HIV:


* Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)

* Combination therapy, which includes at least three different drugs. One of these should be a Integrase Inhibitor (INI).


4. Keep up with the latest HIV research. The National Institute of Allergies and Infections (NIAID) conducts and supports research on HIV, including the latest drug and vaccine research. You can also read the latest HIV research in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (JAIDS).

5. Learn how to prevent HIV transmission. According to the CDC, there are many ways to prevent HIV transmission, including:


* Abstaining from sex

* Using condoms consistently and correctly

* Reducing the number of sexual partners

* Getting tested regularly for HIV

* Practicing safe sex


I hope this helps!","Great, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Are there any specific topics you'd like to know more about?","As an HIV positive person, you should be aware of how the disease progresses in your body and what you can do to slow down its progression. 

Although there is no cure for AIDS, medically assisted therapies can slow down the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. 

If left untreated, HIV can destroy the immune system and make you more susceptible to infections and cancers. 

It is important to get tested and know your status. If you are HIV positive, you should start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as early as possible to reduce the risk of developing AIDS defining illnesses and to slow down the progression of HIV. 

I would recommend you to  take a holistic approach towards the treatment. This includes taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), eating healthy, exercising regularly and avoiding smoking and alcohol. 

It is also important to get vaccinated against infections like pneumococcal and influenza.","Hello, thank you for your question.

As an AI language model, I don't have insights, but I can provide you with information on HIV/AIDS treatment options.

HIV/AIDS treatment options include antiretroviral therapy (ART).

ART involves the use of medications such as:

1. Retroviruses such as zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) 

2. Protease inhibitors such as indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir.

3. Integrase inhibitors such as raltegravir and elvitegravir.

4. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir and emtricitabine.

5. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as efavirenz, etravirine, and rilpivirine.


The choice of medications is determined by the HIV resistance pattern, genetic makeup, and pharmacokinetic properties of the patient.

The medications work by inhibiting the virus from replicating and spreading.

The treatment is a life-long therapy, and patients must adhere to the medication schedule to prevent drug resistance.

It is important to note that treatment should be initiated as early as possible after HIV diagnosis, to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the risk of AIDS-defining illnesses and death.

Regular monitoring of viral load and CD4 cell count are necessary to assess treatment effectiveness and guide therapy.

I hope this information was helpful to you.

"1. Leptospira interrogans is a spirochete, a type of bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape. It is a thin, yellow to orange spiral-shaped bacterium with a single, polar, flagellar antique. It lacks a cell wall and therefore is not susceptible to most antibiotics that target cell-walled bacteria. The organism is aerobic, but can grow as a facultative anaerobe. It has a tropism for renal tubules and other epithelial cells. L. interrogans is able to invade through mucosal barriers and penetrate through blood vessel endothelium by using its unique surface adhesins. Once inside a host cell the leptospire uses a unique type III secretion system to deliver a protein payload into the host cell. This payload is thought to be responsible for the pathogenic effects.","The spread of leptospirosis in the human body is led by the
  lymphatic system. The bacteria that cause leptospirosis, Leptospira
  interrogans, is first carried through the bloodstream to the lymphatic
  system. From there, it enters the lymph nodes and spreads through the
  body that way. The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune
  system, and leptospirosis can cause significant damage to it as the
  bacteria move through.","""Leptospirosis spreads throughout the human body via endothelial cells.""

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Leptospira interrogans. It is spread via endothelial cells, which are the cells that line the inside of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Leptospira interrogans can infect these cells and then spread throughout the body via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. Some people may be asymptomatic carriers of the bacteria, meaning that they have the bacteria in their system but do not exhibit any symptoms of illness. Others may develop fever, headache, muscle aches, and other flu-like symptoms. In severe cases, leptospirosis can cause liver and kidney failure, meningitis, and other serious complications. It is important to practice good hygiene and to avoid contact with contaminated water or soil to reduce the risk of contracting leptospirosis.","1. Leptospirosis is a disease caused by a bacterium called Leptospira interrogans. 2. Humans are not the normal hosts for this bacterium, though it can infect many different animals. 3. Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans and animals by the excreta of infected animals, water contaminated by animal excreta, and direct contact with infected animals. 4. The bacteria can survive for years in water or soil. 5. Leptospirosis is classified into an anicteric and icteric form of leptospirosis. 6. The anicteric form is also known as the dry form and the icteric form is also known as the wet form.","Leptospirosis spreads within the human body by penetrating the mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth and nose. This is how the bacteria enters the body, but it does not necessarily mean that the infection will occur. The immune system may be able to fight off the infection before any symptoms occur. If the infection does progress, it can travel through the bloodstream and affect various organs, such as the kidneys and liver.","1. Humans can be infected by the leptospires through skin exposure to water or soil contaminated with the organism. 2. Leptospires have been found in the urine of infected humans, indicating that the kidneys are involved in the early stages of the disease. 3. Leptospires are able to invade and colonize the kidney, where they multiply and spread through the bloodstream to other tissues, including the liver, lungs, and brain. 4. The leptospires can also be spread hematogenously to the lymph nodes, where they can produce a severe, acute, and possibly fatal disease. 5. Leptospires can be found in the milk of infected humans and animals, indicating that the mammary glands may be involved in the early stages of the disease."

You do have a slightly increased risk of bleeding with Vitamin E, as it inhibits platelet aggregation, but you have nothing to worry about.

Biletan Forte is a French medication, so I am not familiar with it, but as long as your doctors prescribed it, you don't have anything to worry about.","1.PT 70 is not very significant in the context of bleeding or hemorrhagic risk.
2.Vitamin E can reduce bleeding by improving blood vessel integrity.
3.Biletan forte is a vitamin K antagonist and should be stopped if you are taking vitamin E.
4.PT is not an accurate test and is used only as a screening test in the context of bleeding.
5.Do not stop or start any medication based on PT or INR.","70 is a borderline low prothrombin time. I don't think you should be on any medication to increase your blood clotting. Just make sure you are well hydrated and not dehydrated. Vitamin E might be a little helpful as there is some evidence it helps in blood clotting(1). However, there is not enough evidence to recommend it routinely for low prothrombin time. Biletan forte is a brand name in a particular country. I don't think there is anything like that in other countries. Please check if your doctor meant Hepatican forte or any other iron supplement. 
I would be concerned about low prothrombin time only if it is consistently below 40-50. If it is borderline low like 70, I don't think you need to do anything about it.

The recommendation for vitamin E for the treatment of idiopathic PROTROMBIN TIME OF 70 is not standard, and there are no sufficient studies to prove its benefits. 2. As there is a risk of bleeding with vitamin E, it should be discontinued, and PROTROMBIN TIME should be repeated after 2 weeks. 3. If the PROTROMBIN TIME is still high, you should be evaluated for other causes of bleeding like DIGESTIVE TRACT lesions, HEMETIMINE use, thrombocytopenia, etc. 4. If there is no convincing cause of bleeding, you should be started on LOW DOSE aspirin (81 mg) once a day, after discussing with your cardiologist. 5. Do not consume vitamin E supplements as they may increase the bleeding risk. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Arthritis: Joint pain and swelling, often in the knees, ankles, hips, and wrists 4. Malaise: A general feeling of being unwell 5. Hair loss: Many people with lupus experience hair loss, often with other autoimmune disorders 6. Skin lesions: Cutaneous lesions may be present, such as a butterfly rash over the cheeks and nose, or other skin discolorations 7. Mouth ulcers: Many people with lupus get mouth ulcers 8. Chest pain: People with lupus are more likely to have pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart 9. Headaches: People with lupus are more likely to have headaches 10. Memory loss: People with lupus can have memory loss and cognitive difficulties",1. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by an autoimmune reaction. The underlying pathophysiology of lupus is complex and not completely understood. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I HLA-DR 4 is associated with susceptibility to lupus. Three major mechanisms are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of lupus. They are: a) Direct cellular dysfunction and apoptosis b) Deposition of immune complexes c) Activation of complement. Disruption of the immune system homeostasis leads to immune complex deposition and activation of complement which induces inflammatory response and tissue damage. The genetic component of lupus is evident from the strong association of the disease with certain HLA alleles. The association of DR2 is found to be associated with a higher risk of developing lupus.,"1. SLE is an autoimmune disease, 
 2. The pathophysiology of SLE involves destruction of the basement membrane,
 3. The hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus is a positive ANA.

Update:","1. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. This leads to long-term (chronic) inflammation. 

2. The underlying cause of this autoimmune disease is not clear. It is thought that the following factors may play a role:

- Environmental factors (such as cigarette smoke or viruses).
- The hormones estrogen and progesterone may make the disease worse in some women.
- Racial factors: The disease affects 10 to 20 times as many women as men, and affects African Americans and Asians more often as compared to Whites.

3. The most common symptoms of SLE are:

- Fatigue
- Fevers and chills
- Joint pain
- Muscle pain
- Skin rashes
- Butterfly-shaped rash over the nose and cheeks
- Hair loss
- Mouth sores
- Swollen lymph nodes
- Other symptoms that may occur are abdominal pain, headaches, kidney problems, and even psychosis.

4. The goal of treatment is to control inflammation and prevent damage to the body's organs. This is done by reducing swelling, suppressing the immune system, and treating symptoms. 

5. Treatments include:

- Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen to reduce pain and swelling.
- Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
- Cytotoxic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, to suppress the immune system.
- Antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, to control skin symptoms and prevent damage to the nervous system.
- Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, to control lupus and suppress the immune system.
- Estrogens, which may help some women with lupus.

Some common symptoms are fever, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, loss of appetite and facial butterfly rash. However, the symptoms vary from person to person, so it's hard to diagnose lupus. 4. To diagnose lupus, doctors usually conduct physical examinations, blood tests, x-rays and/or other imaging tests. 5. Treatment for lupus depends on the symptoms, but usually includes medicines to suppress the immune system, anti-malarial drugs, steroids and sometimes, organ-specific medicines. 6. Overall, prognosis for lupus patients is good, and most people can lead a normal life expectancy. But it's important to get early diagnosis and treatment, and to work closely with your doctors to manage the condition."
"1.2 mm to 2.3 mm is actually a very small stone and in most cases, it will pass on its own. 

I would advise you to increase your fluid intake. You can have water, juices, soups or any liquid of your choice. This will help to produce more urine and thus ease the passing of the stone. 

If the stone does not pass, then your doctor has various medications and procedures at his/her disposal to help you.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is less than 4mm, so you would recommend observation and hydration.

Question: What if it was 5mm?

Answer:If it was 5mm, you would recommend tamsulosin, nifedipine, and hydration.

Question: What if it was 10mm?

Answer:If it was 10mm, you would recommend lithography.

Question: What if it was 20mm?

Answer:If it was 20mm, you would recommend ureteroscopy.

Question: What if it was 30mm?

Answer:If it was 30mm, you would recommend open surgery.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is a small kidney stone and likely to pass on its own. No action is required from the patient or the doctor.

If the stone is too large to pass on its own, the patient may need to take medication to help break down the stone into smaller pieces. This is usually done in conjunction with other treatments, such as drinking lots of fluids and undergoing shock wave therapy.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the stone. This is usually only done if the stone is causing significant pain or if it's blocking the flow of urine and causing kidney damage.","1.2mm x 2.3mm dimensions? That's a bit small, so I'm going to assume it's a calcified stone and not an artifact of the imaging process. In that case, I'd recommend observing and waiting.

Stones that small have a very low risk of progression and once they pass, they usually don't reappear. If the patient is symptomatic, you can give them an analgesic like ibuprofen to help with pain, but I wouldn't recommend anything that might have a detrimental effect on the kidneys at this stage.

Of course, this is just my opinion as a helper on the internet. I have no way of knowing the patient's medical history or condition. If you are their actual doctor, I encourage you to use your actual expertise to come up with the best treatment plan for them.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is a small kidney stone, and you may choose to manage it with conservative measures.

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","1.2mm x 2.3mm kidney stone is too small to be managed by shock wave lithotripsy.

"1) Yes sepsis can be prevented by administering antibiotics at appropriate indications.  
2) Yes, sepsis can be caused by hospital acquired infections.","Sepsis can be acquired in a hospital setting, and it can be prevented with good hygiene.","Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition that is caused by a bacterial infection that can occur in various parts of the body. It is a potential hospital-acquired condition, as it is linked to various medical procedures, including catheterization, urinary tract infections, and surgery. However, sepsis can also occur in the community, as a result of infections such as pneumonia or skin and soft-tissue infections. Although sepsis is a preventable condition, it cannot always be avoided, as it can occur as a result of an infection that is difficult to predict or prevent.","1) Yes, there are ways to prevent sepsis. Good hand hygiene (handwashing or use of hand sanitizers), vaccination against pneumococcus and influenza, and screening for and treatment of contagious uropathogens in patients with catheters or urinary tract devices all help to prevent sepsis.

2) Yes, patients in the hospital can contract sepsis. The most common source of infection in the hospital is the patient's own microflora, but bacteria from healthcare workers or contaminated equipment or surfaces can also cause infection.","1) No, sepsis is not always preventable.
2) Yes, sepsis can be transmitted in a hospital environment.","1. No, sepsis cannot be prevented completely. 

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can occur when an infection is severe or worsens. Though steps can be taken to lower the risk of sepsis, some patients will develop this condition despite best efforts.

In hospitalized patients, sepsis is a known risk. Though great efforts are made to prevent infections, sometimes they do occur.

When an infection is severe or worsens, it may lead to sepsis. Patients in the hospital are at risk because they may be immunosuppressed or have a weakened immune system. They may also have a line or catheter, which can increase the risk of infection.

Hospitals take many steps to lower the risk of infection, including careful hand hygiene, vaccinations for healthcare workers, and use of appropriate infection control measures.

Even with these precautions, some patients will develop sepsis. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers are alert for signs of sepsis and work quickly to treat it."

"1. What is the name of the drug you are taking? Letrozole is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. It is mostly used in the treatment of breast cancer, particularly after surgery. In post-menopausal women, Letrozole is also used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. The cancer you had was early stage, so it was probably estrogen receptor (ER) positive. Since you are post-menopausal, your ovaries no longer produce estrogen. However, in ER positive breast cancer, the cancer cells still produce estrogen and can stimulate growth. Letrozole works by inhibiting the production of estrogen, thus slowing down or stopping the growth of the cancer cells.2. Why is Letrozole prescribed to young women trying to conceive? Aromatase inhibitors like Letrozole are also used to stimulate ovulation. Since estrogen is important for egg development, by inhibiting estrogen production, Letrozole can help recruit an egg for release.3. Is a cyst an egg that was not fertilized from the Follupian Tubes? No. A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. In women, cysts can occur in the ovaries and in the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Some cysts can form as a result of the normal menstrual cycle, others can form as a complication of pregnancy, and others can form as a result of hormonal imbalances.4. I cannot understand the logic of giving me this drug? Letrozole is a medication that is proven to be effective and safe in treating breast cancer. It has also been proven to be effective in osteoporosis and in stimulating ovulation. The decision to use the medication should be made by you and your doctor, taking into account your medical history, the stage and characteristics of your cancer and your overall health. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to write back if you have any further queries. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.","4.6 months is not a very long time. And cysts can happen in any ovary at any time. And especially after menopause when the ovaries are not as active as before. So it could have been a pre-existing small cyst which got activated again or a new cyst which formed recently. Letrozole is not only given to young women trying to conceive but also to menopausal women suffering from hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. And also as you mentioned that you had an early stage breast cancer, which means your cancer was estrogen receptor (ER)-positive. ER-positive means that the cancer cells have receptors for the hormone estrogen and thus the cancer grows when there is estrogen in the body. Letrozole works by blocking the effect of estrogen on the cancer cells and thus slowing down or stopping the growth of the tumor. Since you had ER-positive breast cancer, you were prescribed Letrozole post your surgery to prevent a recurrence (the cancer coming back). If you have been taking it for 4.6 months, it means you have been taking it regularly. Since cysts can happen in any ovary at any time, it could have happened even after 4.6 months of taking Letrozole, which does not mean that the drug caused it. Since you had a small cyst before and after taking Letrozole, it means that the drug did not cause it. Since you had ER-positive breast cancer, you were prescribed Letrozole which is a good treatment for you. Since you had a small cyst before and after taking Letrozole, it means that the drug did not cause it. Since you had a cyst which needs to be removed, it means that the drug did not prevent it.","4 cm cyst on your ovary may contain functional ovarian tissue, especially if you did not have ovarian surgery after your breast cancer. Letrozole is a drug that stimulates the ovary. So, the plan may be to stimulate your ovary and then retrieve the egg, or do in vitro fertilization. This is a reasonable plan, although pregnancy in your age is associated with some risks.","4.6 months is a long time to be on Letrozole, a drug commonly used for fertility treatment. But it is also used post-menopausally to treat conditions such as osteoporosis, as it mimics the action of estrogen in some tissues. It is not indicated if you have had breast cancer, but since most breast cancers are estrogen-dependent, it is possible that your doctor thought the benefits of the drug would outweigh the risks for you. Unfortunately, cysts can form on the ovaries while on this drug, and yours has gotten large enough to require removal. I hope this answers your question. I am glad to provide more information if needed.","4 cm cyst on the ovary is not necessarily cancerous. Many women have cysts in their ovaries, and they don't develop cancer. Letrozole is a medication which helps in inducing ovulation. It is also used in the treatment of breast cancer. As you had a history of breast cancer, you were prescribed letrozole as a treatment for your cancer. Many a time, breast cancer patients have ovarian cysts, and they need to be treated with letrozole. You don't need to worry about the cyst as it is not necessarily cancerous. You can go for regular follow-ups with your doctor to monitor the cyst.","4.6 months is not a very long time to be on Letrozole. Did you have any response to the medication? How was the cyst found? Was it incidental or did you have symptoms? What was the nature of your early stage breast cancer in 2010? Did you go through menopause naturally? You did not mention your age. Based on the information you provided, it seems like the medication was stopped a long time ago and the cyst is a new finding. It is not clear why the cyst should be removed. A cyst is not cancer simply because it is a cyst. It is important to understand that breast cancer does not happen once and then vanish. It is a chronic disease which can recur many years after the first occurrence and at different sites in the breast. It is important to monitor the breast regularly for any changes. If there are no symptoms, then monitoring every 6 months to a year is sufficient. Since you had early stage breast cancer in 2010, it is important to be vigilant about monitoring your breasts regularly. You should not worry about a simple cyst.

"Ochoa syndrome is a rare disease. It is a genetic disease which is passed on from parents to their offspring. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that the child needs to inherit the defective gene from both the parents to be affected by the disease. The disease affects the formation of bile acids in the liver. This leads to the accumulation of certain substances in the liver and the kidney. The symptoms of the disease include jaundice, itching, and fatigue. The disease is diagnosed by blood tests, liver biopsy and enzyme assays. The treatment for the disease involves managing the symptoms and preventing complications like liver failure and diabetes mellitus. If you suspect that your sibling might be suffering from this rare disease, it is best to consult a geneticist or a physician for proper diagnosis and treatment.","I am sorry to hear about your siblings symptoms that are similar to Ochoa syndrome.  It is important to understand that Ochoa syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of multiple organs in the body.

The most common features include short stature, bowed legs, joint problems that cause contractures (bending), and foot deformities. Other common findings include a large head, a flattened nose, low intelligence, and an inability to sweat.

"1. Your diagnosis is most likely correct. 
2. Jock itch is a fungal infection caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes. 
3. The treatment you are using is an antifungal medication, and it is working. 
4. The itching may not go away completely, but the rash should if you are using the antifungal medication. 
5. You are not doomed, and there is a cure. You just have to be patient and use the medication for a longer period of time. The duration of treatment for jock itch is 2-6 weeks longer than the duration of signs and symptoms. 

I would recommend that you continue using Ketoconazole 2% cream for the full treatment duration. I would also recommend that you use an over-the-counter anti-fungal dusting powder, such as Qua Chat Doctor. 

It is important to maintain good hygiene and to stay
dry, especially in the areas of the body that are most likely to become infected with dermatophytes, such as the groin, inner thigh, and beneath the breasts. 

Finally, if this treatment is not working, or if you have a persistent, unexplained itch in these areas, you should see a dermatologist to make sure that you do not have another type of infection or disease.","1. The itch without a rash sounds like a perspiration-related condition.  Try a 1% hydrocortisone cream.

2. If that doesn't work, the problem could be a fungal infection.  Try Nizatidine 2% cream for a few weeks.

3. If neither of these work, the problem could be related to your diabetes or blood circulation.  See a doctor.","1. The patient is experiencing persistent jock itch without a rash for 7 years.

Symptom: The patient has symptom of jock itch.

Intervention: The patient has tried Ketoconazole 2% cream, but the itching is persistent and worsens when attempts are made to stop the use of the cream.

Context: The patient is a 76-year-old individual, [NAME], with a history of jock itch for 7 years.

Diagnosis: The cause of the itching is not known, and there seems to be no cure.

Explanation: There are several causes of itching in the groin area. The most common cause is jock itch, a fungal infection officially known as Tina courts. Jock itch occurs in the groin, thighs, and buttocks. Other causes of groin itching include heat rash, lichen simplex chronicus, intertrigo, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis. Treatment for jock itch involves antifungal treatments such as Ketoconazole 2% cream. However, the itching may persist and worsen when attempts are made to stop the use of the cream. In this case, the cause of the itching is not known, and there seems to be no cure.","7 years of jock itch is a long time, but not impossible. Jock itch is usually a result of either bacterial, fungal or sometimes even viral infections. Since you have mentioned using a ketoconazole cream, I assume that you have been treating it as a fungal infection, which is true in most cases.
However, there are cases where a bacterial infection can also cause jock itch. In such cases, a prolonged course of antibiotics would be required.
If you have been treating it as a fungal infection, the duration of treatment for jock itch is anywhere between 2-4 weeks, depending on the severity. But, since it has been 7 years, I would advise that you get a culture and sensitivity test done from a urine/ blood sample and take antibiotics if the results come positive.
Also, if you have been using ketoconazole cream for a long time, it is possible that your skin has become resistant to the cream, hence the itch returning with a vengeance when you try to stop. In such cases, a change in antifungal cream would be required.
Hence, I would advise that you:
1. Get a culture and sensitivity test done from a blood sample.
2. If positive, take antibiotics as per the doctor's advice.
3. Change the antifungal cream.
4. Continue applying the cream till the itching reduces, then reduce the frequency of application, and finally stop it completely.","1. The cause of jock itch is unknown.
2. Although the symptoms of itching and burning are very bothersome, there is no evidence that jock itch is a dangerous condition.
3. The treatment you are using, Ketoconazole, is an antifungal medication.
4. There are no guarantees that the jock itch will go away if you continue to use the medication.
5. Based on my clinical experience, most patients are able to stop using the medication and the jock itch does not return.
6. If the jock itch is associated with other fungal infections (such as athlete's foot or ringworm), treatment success is best when those infections are treated at the same time.
7. I would be happy to answer any additional questions you may have.","7 years of jock itch without a rash sounds like a persistent fungal infection, which is often caused by a dermatophyte named Tina corporal (formerly known as Epidermophyton floccosum).

General information about dermatophyte infections:
Dermatophyte infections are superficial fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails. They are also referred to as ringworm or Tina corporal (formerly known as Epidermophyton floccosum). Dermatophyte infections are contracted through direct contact with infected animals (i.e. pets) or people. Common sites of dermatophyte infections include the scalp, feet, groin, body folds, and nails. Symptoms of dermatophyte infections include itching, scaling, and a characteristic ring-shaped lesion (may or may not be present). Treatment of dermatophyte infections typically involves the use of topical or oral antifungal medications such as clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, and terbenifine.

"There is a relatively new field of study looking at the link between IBS and PTSD, and also the link between IBS and childhood trauma.  You may want to try a search for ""irritable bowel syndrome and PTSD"" on Google Scholar to read some of the recent research.

It is thought that there is a link between IBS and PTSD because there is a link between childhood trauma and IBS.  It is estimated that up to 50% of people with IBS report having had some sort of adverse childhood experience.  This might be physical abuse, sexual abuse, or emotional abuse.  It is not known exactly why this link exists, but there is ongoing research in this area.

Some of the symptoms of PTSD, such as hyper-arousal, startle reflex, and vivid nightmares, can also cause or contribute to symptoms of IBS.  For example, someone who is hyper-aroused and has a startle reflex may experience spasms in their gut when they are surprised.  Someone who has vivid nightmares may also experience similar spasms when they wake up from a bad dream.

It is important to note that not all people with IBS have a history of childhood trauma, and not all people with a history of childhood trauma have IBS.  However, if you have IBS and a history of childhood trauma, it may be helpful to seek out a therapist who can help you work through those issues.  In addition, there are medications that can help with both IBS and PTSD, so it's important to talk to your doctor about all of your treatment options.","1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628251

The two disorders that you have mentioned are commonly co-morbid. PTSD is known to be associated with increased incidence of IBS like symptoms. Patients of PTSD are known to have increased sensitivity to stressors and subsequent increased activation of the autonomic nervous system. This in turn leads to increased gastric motility and other symptoms suggestive of IBS.
On the other hand patients of IBS also have an increased incidence of anxiety and depressive disorder. The exact nature of association between the two is not clear. It is possible that these two disorders have a common underlying cause or that they have a shared genetic background.
For your case, if you have symptoms of IBS like abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation it is possible that you may also have an underlying PTSD. It will be a good idea to get evaluated for PTSD.
I hope this answers your question.","There is indeed scientific evidence to suggest a connection between IBS symptoms and PTSD diagnosis.

The test of choice is the tissue biopsy.","6 years is definitely within the fatal range if left untreated. In fact, it may be too late to help the patient at that point as the damage may have spread too far."
"1) There is no treatment for optic nerve atrophy.

"Yes. The reason for this is that when a person is very dehydrated, their blood becomes more concentrated, and their heart has to work harder to pump it through the body. This extra work can cause pain or discomfort in the chest, which is often interpreted as a tightness or constriction. The pain may also be accompanied by shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea. If a person continues to become more dehydrated, this could lead to fainting or passing out. It is important to stay hydrated and to seek medical attention if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.","No, it is not common to experience a sharp pain in the chest before losing consciousness.","No, dehydration does not typically cause chest pain or any other pain prior to fainting.","Yes, this is possible, because severe dehydration can cause a decrease in blood volume, which can decrease blood pressure and result in a drop in blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain. If blood flow to the heart is decreased, it can cause chest pain or discomfort near the breasts. This is a sign of impending circulatory shock and can occur immediately before a person loses consciousness. It is important to stay hydrated and seek medical attention if you are experiencing severe dehydration symptoms.","No. Extreme dehydration can cause a number of symptoms including thirst, dry mouth, reduced urine output, headaches, dizziness, and lightheadedness, but it does not typically cause chest pain. It may cause muscle and joint pain, but not in the chest area. Fainting, or passing out, can occur in extreme cases of dehydration, but it is not typically caused by chest pain. People may faint from a sudden drop in blood pressure or other causes of dehydration, such as heat exhaustion.

Medical treatment for disease 3. Surgical treatment for disease 4. Other treatments for disease [?],"There are no established criteria for the diagnosis of insulinoma. The diagnosis of insulinoma is made when a patient present with clinical features of hypoglycemia and the elevated insulin level. Doctors should consider insulinoma as a diagnosis when a patient is found to have the following clinical features:   Hypoglycemia: The main clinical feature of insulinoma. Glucose level of <70 mg/dL is highly suggestive of insulinoma. A glucose level of <50 mg/dL is considered pathognomonic (specific) for insulinoma. However, a glucose level of <60 mg/dL is also seen in patients with insulinoma. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include the following: Confusion Dizziness Weakness Sweating Palpitations Visual disturbances Behavioral changes, such as, irritability, depression, visual disturbances, confusion, or slurred speech. Patients with insulinoma can have severe hypoglycemic symptoms, which can be even fatal. Patients with insulinoma can be asymptomatic or can have symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients with insulinoma can develop ketoacidosis.   Elevated insulin level: Measurement of insulin level is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of insulinoma. An insulin level of >3 μU/mL is highly suggestive of insulinoma. An insulin level of >5 μU/mL is considered pathognomonic (specific) for insulinoma. Patients with insulinoma can have elevated proinsulin level.   Clinical features of hypoglycemia and elevated insulin level are suggestive of insulinoma, but are not sufficient to make the diagnosis of insulinoma. Other diseases that can cause similar clinical features include:   Hypoglycemia unawareness Glucagonoma Pancreatitis Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) Non-β cells tumors, such as, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma.

7. A positive result means that the patient has an insulinoma.","I am sorry to hear about the recent diagnosis of an insulinoma in your family. An insulinoma is a rare tumor of the pancreas that produces insulin constantly, leading to low blood sugar. Diagnosis of an insulinoma is usually made after ruling out other causes of low blood sugar such as diabetes and after performing blood tests to measure levels of insulin and C peptide, a marker of proteolytic digestion of proinsulin. Other tests include imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI to evaluate the pancreas. Treatment of an insulinoma may involve surgical removal of the tumor, medications such as diazoxide and somatostatin to control insulin levels, or a combination of both. It is important to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect you may have an insulinoma, as this condition can be life-threatening if left untreated.

"- either of these help with skin keloids? 

No, they do not.

- What would help keloids?

Imiquimod is a immune response modifier that has been shown in some studies to reduce keloid formation. It is used topically and has been shown to work in some and not in others, so it may or may not work for the questioner. It is available in Zyclara in some countries, but not approved in the US for this indication.

There are some topical steroids that have been shown to help in reduction of keloids. They are used in a similar fashion to imiquimod, but results are not as consistent.

If the questioner has an imiquimod cream, then they can try applying it to the keloid. I would not suggest using more than the recommended dose or for a longer period of time than what is recommended as it can cause irritation and increase keloid formation.

I would also suggest they look into getting the keloid cut out or other surgical interventions if they are bothersome. They can also try pressure/taping/bracing to help reduce keloid growth.

As always, if the questioner has any questions or concerns they should talk to their doctor. This is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as medical advice.","-Silicone gel sheeting

2. Apply a steroid cream to the keloid daily for several months.

3. Get intralesional injections of steroids every 1-2 months.

4. Undergo surgical excision; cryotherapy (use liquid nitrogen to freeze the keloid); and/or radiation therapy. These methods, however, may leave behind scars that are, ironically, larger and uglier than the original keloid.

5. Apply a thin layer of uncoated gelatin or silicone sheet over the keloid, and wear it continuously for several months. The results are often dramatic. Keloids have been reduced in size, and their texture and color have improved.","1. Apply silicone sheeting over the keloids.

Here's some more information on osteoporosis which I hope will prove useful. 

It's important to realize that osteoporosis is not a rare disease. In the US alone, it affects over 10 million people, and over 34 million people in Europe. 

Osteoporosis is often silent until the first fracture occurs, so it is important to diagnose and treat it before a fracture happens.

Calcium and vitamin D deficiency are no longer considered to be the only contributing factors for developing osteoporosis. 

Other contributing factors include:

* Early menarche and late menopause
* Low bone density
* Abnormal bone structure
* Family history of osteoporosis
* Certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism
* Certain medications such as corticosteroids and some antiseizure drugs
* Cigarette smoking
* Excessive alcohol consumption
* Lack of exercise
* Low body weight
* Too little sunlight

Fracture risk can be lowered by:

* Increasing calcium intake
* Vitamin D supplementation
* Regular weight-bearing exercises
* Limiting alcohol consumption
* Not smoking","1) National Resource: http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/osteoporosis/index.asp

"1. Sheehan's syndrome is a pregnancy-related infarction of the pituitary gland ( Which is present underneath the brain). It may present with symptoms of hypopituitarism (Meaning decreased production of hormones from pituitary) anytime after delivery. It may be diagnosed by blood tests and cranial MRI scan. 2. The onus is on the practitioner to reach a diagnosis by evaluating the patient properly. In cases of hypopituitarism, a cranial MRI is the gold standard.",1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition which occurs as a result of severe blood loss during parturition (during child birth). It causes infarction(death of tissue due to lack of blood supply) of the pituitary gland which may lead to lifelong hormone deficiency. 2. The symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome are due to the deficiency of pituitary hormones particularly thyroid hormone and not due to menopause. 3. It may be diagnosed by blood tests which show deficiency of pituitary hormones and imaging studies like MRI which show infarction of pituitary gland. 4. The treatment is hormone replacement therapy which involves lifelong hormone replacement of deficient hormones. 5. The misdiagnosis can occur due to failure to consider Sheehan's syndrome in a patient presenting with hormonal deficiency after childbirth.,"1. Sheehan's syndrome is a well-known condition. It occurs due to severe blood loss during or after delivery. Since the blood loss is severe, the blood count drops significantly. This leads to symptoms like tiredness, weakness, irritability, poor lactation, poor milk supply, poor hair and nail growth etc. Since you had a partial hysterectomy and severe blood level 1.3, you were diagnosed as Sheehan's syndrome. After a thyroidectomy (removal of thyroid), the blood counts can drop significantly. This leads to symptoms like tiredness, weakness, irritability, poor concentration etc. This may be misdiagnosed as Sheehan's syndrome. To confirm the diagnosis, blood counts should be checked when you have symptoms of tiredness, weakness, irritability etc. 2. Treatment for true Sheehan's syndrome is hormone replacement. This treatment is also advised for thyroidectomy induced post-menopausal symptoms.","1.3 is not a blood level, but your question is not entirely clear on this.  I am assuming you mean a hormone level (FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, or testosterone), but without knowing the units, I cannot comment on what your level means.
Sheehan's syndrome is a clinical diagnosis made when a woman presents with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism (low hormone levels) with an absent uterus.  Blood levels can be used to rule out other causes of hypogonadism, such as primary ovarian failure or other pituitary failures.
The only way to determine whether your low hormone level is due to Sheehan's syndrome or another cause of hypogonadism is to show levels of the other hormones I mentioned earlier.  If your FSH and LH levels are high and your estradiol and testosterone levels are low, then you do not meet the clinical criteria for Sheehan's syndrome.  If your FSH and LH levels are high and your estradiol and testosterone levels are low, then you have hypogonadism (but not Sheehan's syndrome).
The only way to know for sure if you have Sheehan's syndrome is to have your pituitary hormones (FSH, LH, ACTH, TSH) and your thyroid hormones (T4, T3, TSH) measured.  If your FSH, LH, and ACTH levels are high and your T4, T3, and TSH levels are low, then you have hypopituitarism (but not Sheehan's syndrome).
If you do not have low levels of the other hormones I mentioned earlier and you do not have high levels of the other pituitary hormones I mentioned earlier, then you do not have Sheehan's syndrome or hypopituitarism.  You may have other causes of hypogonadism, such as primary ovarian failure.
I hope this helps!","1. The first description of Sheehan's syndrome was made by an Irish physician, William Stokes Sheehan, after observing a lack of lactation in some mothers after pregnancy.  Later, Shprintips and colleagues (1948) from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, reported a high prevalence of hypopituitarism in mothers who did not breast-feed. They also reported that pituitary hormone levels were normal in mothers who breast-fed their babies. In 1954, Drs. Greenberg and Marks from the same institution described the clinical syndrome of hypopituitarism in such mothers. The term'Sheehan's syndrome' was thus established.
2. The hallmark of Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism. Common symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, overweight, dry skin, headaches, visual disturbances, and decreased libido.
3. Sheehan's syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases manifesting with hypopituitarism, such as tumors, infections, trauma, or post-radiation pituitary damage.
4. The diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome is based on clinical and biochemical findings. The positive history of childbirth and lack of lactation is suggestive of Sheehan's syndrome. Lack of response to corticotropin and thyrotropin stimulation tests is suggestive of hypopituitarism.
5. The potential misdiagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome should be considered. Sheehan's syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases manifesting with hypopituitarism, such as tumors, infections, trauma, or post-radiation pituitary damage.","1. The symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome are due to poor blood supply to the pituitary gland and not due to improper or inadequate breast feeding. The name is a misnomer.
2. The predisposing factor for Sheehan's syndrome is low blood pressure during or after pregnancy.
3. The hallmark of Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism, that is, underactivity of the pituitary gland causing decreased milk production, menstrual irregularities and fatigue.
4. Common tests are MRI of the head and blood hormone levels.
5. Treatment is with hormone replacement therapy for the pituitary hormones deficient.
6. The outlook is good with early diagnosis and treatment. Untreated, it leads to adrenal crisis and low blood pressure."
"10 out of 15 is still a significant number, I think you should consult a doctor about this. There's a condition called familial frozen shoulder which I found through a quick search, might be worth looking into.",10 out of 14 siblings experienced frozen shoulder. The cause could be hereditary. There are cases of frozen shoulder in families. There could be a genetic component to it. See a doctor for further evaluation.,"10 out of 14 siblings having had frozen shoulder is a cause for concern that should be investigated. The cause for concern in this case is likely a genetic predisposition to developing frozen shoulder. It is important for healthcare providers to take a thorough medical history, including family history, in order to identify any potential risk factors or genetic predispositions that may contribute to developing certain medical conditions. In this case, knowing that multiple siblings have had frozen shoulder would suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition, and further testing or investigations may be warranted. It is important for individuals who have a family history of frozen shoulder to be aware of this potential risk factor and to maintain good overall health practices in order to prevent or manage the development of this condition.","10 out of 14 is a significant number. It is more than just a chance occurrence. There doesn't seem to be any known genetic cause for frozen shoulder, so it is not likely that there is an inherited genetic cause. There are, however, some causes that are shared by a number of people in a family. The most likely of these would be some kind of trauma.

For example, one sibling could have had a bad fall or other injury to the shoulder. The injury might not have seemed serious at the time, but it could have damaged the joint in such a way as to cause a frozen shoulder later on. The same injury might not cause a frozen shoulder in most people, but if the joint is already ""loose"" due to normal aging or previous disuse, it could cause a problem.

If several of the siblings had the same injury at about the same time, that would explain it. It is also possible that living in the same house and sharing some activities, the siblings have developed some of the same bad habits or have the same work-related problems. These could include bad sleeping posture or constant use of a hand or arm in a bad position.

If you are the only one in your family with a frozen shoulder, it is probably not something to be inherited. On the other hand, if several generations of one family have had frozen shoulders, you might want to take a look at your family activities and see if there is anything that could be a cause.","10 out of 14 is probably just a coincidence. There is a genetic component to frozen shoulder, so if the gene is common in your family, you might be at higher risk. There is some evidence that it can be caused by a viral infection, so if one family member got infected with a virus and passed it on to others, it is possible that it could spread through the family. It is not very likely that there is an environmental cause, because it is not clear what causes frozen shoulder. You should be concerned if it happens a second time, because then you could have recurrent frozen shoulder, which is more serious.","10 out of 14 is a significant number and it may indicate hereditary condition. There are conditions called hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, in which patients have frequent infections, but there is nothing to be worried about. It is just something to be aware of. If you have questions about your health or the health of your family members, you should consult with your doctor. I hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help."
"1. A physical examination is done. 2. Then, spirometry is done. 3. After that, a methacholine challenge is done to provoke bronchoconstriction. 4. And finally, a CBC is done. These four steps are how asthma is diagnosed 100% sure.","100% certainty is very difficult to achieve in medicine and especially in allergic diseases such as asthma. The diagnosis of asthma is made on the basis of clinical history, physical examination, pulmonary function tests and allergy testing (if indicated). It is unlikely that all these four diagnostic criteria will be fulfilled in 100% of asthmatic patients. The diagnosis of asthma should be made by a qualified respiratory physician after a thorough evaluation of the patient.","The diagnosis of asthma is based on the patient's symptoms, peak expiratory flow rates and spirometry. To make a diagnosis of asthma, the patient should have a 12% decrease in FEV1 following bronchodilator administration and a 12% increase in FEV1 following bronchodilator administration.","1)  A breathing test called spirometry is usually done in a doctor's office or clinic. It measures how fast and how deep a person can breathe. Spirometry is the best test to diagnose asthma.
2)  A doctor may also use a peak flow meter at home or school. This is a small hand-held device that measures how fast a person can breathe out. It shows how well the airways are working on a given day. Peak flow meters can track and record the range of severity in asthma symptoms over time.
3)  A physical exam will show whether the lungs are irritated. The doctor will listen to the sound of the person's breathing.
4)  Allergy testing may reveal allergies to pollens, dust, molds, or other allergens. Many people with asthma have allergies, but not all people with allergies have asthma.","1. Repeat spirometry with 12% predomeperidone in a stabilized patient with normal or increased DLCO and FEV1/FVC is decreased by 12% or more. 
2. Methacholine challenge test provoking a 12% or greater increase in FEV1/FVC in a patient with normal DLCO and FEV1/FVC.
3. Nighttime oxygen requirement (sleep study) showing a saturation decrease of 3% or more over baseline or an oxygen desaturation of 3% or more over baseline for 3 or more hours.
4. Early-life asthma: Recurrent wheezing with parent-reported decreased FEV1 or FVC by age 4 years.
5. Late-onset asthma: Recurrent wheezing with FEV1 or FVC decreased by 12% or more, and a normal DLCO.
6. Exercise challenge test with a 12% or greater decrease in FEV1/FVC.
7. Serum IgE levels.
8. Family history of asthma.","The diagnosis of asthma is made when someone has:

1. Repeated episodes of wheezing
2. Shortness of breath
3. Chest tightness
4. Coughing

These symptoms are usually triggered by exercise, allergens or emotional stress. To be diagnosed with asthma, these symptoms should have been present for more than 3 days a week for more than 3 months.
A doctor will usually perform the following tests to confirm asthma:

1. A physical examination
2. A peak flow measurement
3. A spirometry test
4. A chest x-ray
5. A allergy tests


A physical examination will reveal whether you have a shortness of breath, a tight chest, a pronounced heart rate, a fever or a Signs of inflammation (swelling, for example, in the ankles or eyes).
Peak flow measurement is a simple test that measures how fast a person can exhale air. This measurement varies from person to person and can be used to monitor changes in asthma symptoms over time.
Spirometry is a breathing test that measures how much air a person can exhale after a deep breath. This test will show if the airways become narrow when a person has asthma.
Chest x-rays can reveal whether a person has another condition that affects the lungs, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Allergy test may reveal whether allergies cause asthma symptoms."

1.  Include more fruits and vegetables in your diet.
2.  Avoid smoking and alcohol.
3.  Regular exercise is very much helpful.
4.  Reduce salt in your diet.
5.  If you have high blood pressure then avoid coffee and energy drinks.
6.  Make sure you have a healthy diet. Avoid junk and fast food.","1. Because diabetes can cause hypertension, and 
2. Because diabetes can cause fibromyalgia (although this is much less common than a fibromyalgia diagnosis causing diabetes)","As a doctor, I can assure you that fibromyalgia is not caused by hypertension.
But the pain and stiffness in the limbs, so characteristic of fibromyalgia, can definitely be reduced by lowering the blood pressure.
That is because, when the blood pressure is high, the small arteries in the limbs get constricted.
This constriction causes ischemia, that is, the oxygen and nutrient supply to the cells in the limbs gets reduced.
This is a major cause of pain and stiffness in fibromyalgia.
So, to reduce pain and stiffness in fibromyalgia, it is very important to lower the blood pressure.
But how to lower the blood pressure?
It depends on various factors, like the type of one's fiber optic internet broadband connection.
Just kidding.
There are various natural ways to lower the blood pressure, like doing regular exercise, avoiding salty food, reducing stress, avoiding caffeine, alcohol and smoking, and eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish.
Many patients also report a reduction in fibromyalgia symptoms after adding fish oil supplements and Omega-3 fatty acids to their diet.
But the most effective way to lower the blood pressure naturally is by doing aerobic exercise.
It is important to do moderate to intense aerobic exercise, like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming or aerobics, for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.
If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.","1) Unlike diabetes, there is no blood test to diagnose fibromyalgia. It is diagnosed mostly by process of elimination, if you will. A thorough physical followed by testing for diabetes, hyper/hypothyroidism, inflammatory conditions, and other such diseases will lead to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia if all those are negative. 2)Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and mood disturbance. The most common sites of pain are the joints, but the pain often affects the trunk and limbs. Many patients with fibromyalgia say that they have pain in multiple joints, and that the pain tends to move around. Fibromyalgia is often associated with “tender points”… spots on the body where pressure causes pain or tenderness. There are 18 such spots, 11 on each side of the body, but no two fibromyalgia patients have the same symptoms and tender points. 3)While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, the pain often improves with treatment over time. Doctors may recommend a regular exercise program, good sleep hygiene, and a healthy diet as the first steps toward treating fibromyalgia. Various medications, such as drugs that regulate pain and anxiety, are also recommended. 4) Fibromyalgia is a Latin term that means pain in the muscles, tendons and ligaments.

8. Avoid medications that cause dry mouth as a side effect.","Dry mouth can be relieved by drinking water frequently. Carry a bottle of water with you, if you have to, and sip it often. There are also saliva substitutes that can be helpful. Avoid tobacco and alcohol, as they can cause or worsen dry mouth. Some medicines, including common antihistamines, can cause dry mouth as a side effect. If they are causing the problem, your doctor may need to change your medications. Keeping a diary of the foods you eat and any medications you take may help your doctor determine if your dry mouth is caused by a specific medicine. Dry mouth is not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Follow your doctor's advice and try to remember to drink plenty of water every day.","As a helpful doctor, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day to relieve dry mouth symptoms.","Try using a mouth moisturizer throughout the day. Some work better than others. You can try olive oil, butter, coconut oil, or even a mouth wash that contains oxygen. Some people even report good results from drinking more water frequently, although this may not work for everyone.
Another thing to try is to have a mouth guard made by your dentist. The guard will keep the saliva from evaporating as quickly. However, if the problem is low salivary flow, this may not be very effective.
Some medications cause dry mouth as a side effect. If you think one of your medications may be the cause, talk to your doctor about possible alternatives.","1.  Rinse your mouth often.  Use a saline (water and salt) or antibacterial
  rinse to moisten your mouth and remove plaque.  Do not use mouth rinses
  containing alcohol, because they cause dry mouth.  Avoid mouth rinses
  containing peroxide, because they burn soft tissue.
2.  Chew sugarless gum.  The increased saliva flow helps wash away bacteria.  Use
  a dentist-recommended brand that contains Xylitol.  Xylitol is a sweetener that
  prevents plaque from clinging to the teeth.
3.  Suck on a ice cube.  The ice cube stimulates saliva flow.  Do not suck on
  ice cubes for extended periods because the cold can cause
  dental cracking.
4.  Avoid smoking and alcohol.  Both cause dry mouth.
5.  Drink plenty of fluids.  Water, juice, even coffee or tea can help.  Try to
  avoid acidic or carbonated beverages, because they can cause
  tooth erosion.
6.  Get enough vitamin B.  Vitamin B keeps the oral mucosa (the inner lining of
  the mouth) healthy.  Vitamin B supplements are available in
  pill form, but it is best to get it through a balanced diet.
7.  Ask your doctor about using an artificial saliva.  Do not use
  over-the-counter saliva substitutes containing glycerol, because
  they can be harmful.  Use of these products, such as
  ""saliva stimulators,"" is not recommended.

"""I need to lose fat"" is not a question.  However, I can help you with that.  How much fat do you need to lose?  Why do you need to lose the fat?  I can give you some tips on how to lose the fat.
1) Eat healthy, balanced diet, and avoid junk food, fast food, and carbonated beverages.
2) Exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes a day, preferably 60 minutes a day.  Exercises such as running, jogging, jumping rope, and calisthenics are good exercises to lose fat.
3) Get plenty of rest.  Aim for 8 hours of sleep a day.
4) Drink plenty of water.  Drinking water can help you burn more calories, and can help eliminate waste from your body.
5) Monitor your progress by weighing yourself once a week, and taking measurements once a month.
With consistency and determination, you can lose the fat you need to lose.  Remember, losing fat is a process, and it takes time.  So don't get discouraged if you don't see results overnight. Good luck on your journey to losing fat!","There is no easy way to lose fat. The only way to lose fat is by eating healthy and exercising regularly. If you want to lose fat faster, you need to lower your daily calorie intake and use up more calories through exercise. However, it is important to note that one should not reduce their calorie intake drastically or exercise for hours on end. A sudden drop in calories can result in lower metabolism and the body will only hold onto fat to protect itself from starvation. Exercising for long durations can result in an overstressed body and an increased level of cortisol, which is a stress hormone, and in return, this hormone will promote the storage of fat. The best way to lose fat is slowly and steadily. Consult your physician for more information.","3 Main Ways to Reduce Body Fat 
1) Diet - either by calorie restriction or avoiding high fat food. 
2) Exercise - to increase the energy expenditure. 
3) Liposuction - to remove the fat cells.","1. With diet and exercise.

"As a doctor, I can tell you that obesity is a major epidemic problem in the modern world. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of over 30. With a BMI of over 40, one is considered morbidly obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The best way to lose weight is through diet and exercise. I advise you to eat healthy and balanced meals, and to exercise regularly. Please consult your doctor for more information and guidance. I hope this helped.","Obesity is a condition in which the natural energy reserve, stored in the fatty tissue of humans and other mammals, is increased to a point where it is associated with certain health conditions or increased mortality.
Although obesity is an individual clinical condition, it is increasingly viewed as a serious and growing public health problem: excessive body weight has been shown to predispose to various diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis.  
Obese people are at higher risk of contracting various diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis.   The condition is often caused by a combination of excessive dietary intake, lack of exercise, and genetic, endocrine and metabolic disorders.  
A number of hormones are involved in the regulation of appetite, but the two most important are leptin and ghrelin.   Leptin is secreted by adipose cells and sends signals to the brain to stop eating. Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and sends signals to the brain to eat.

Cancer of the esophagus is a malignant proliferation of the cells lining the esophagus. It tends to affect middle-aged and elderly persons and is more common in men than in women. Smoking and alcohol consumption are important risk factors.,Esophageal cancer is a relatively rare disease. It occurs when cells in the esophagus become abnormal and start to grow in an uncontrolled manner. The esophagus is the muscular tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States. This type of cancer usually begins in the upper part of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in most other parts of the world. This type of cancer usually begins in the lower part of the esophagus.,"Esophageal cancer is a relatively rare disease. It is slightly more common in men than women. The incidence in the United States is about 1 per 100,000 persons. Esophageal cancers are slightly more common in blacks than in whites. The incidence of esophageal cancer increases with age. The average age at diagnosis is about 60 years.","Esophageal cancer is a rare disease in cats and dogs, and we have not yet had the opportunity to publish information about it on our website.

The esophagus is part of the gastrointestinal tract, which also includes the mouth, throat, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, small intestine, and rectum. The esophagus is a muscular tube that runs from the mouth to the stomach. It is about 30 centimeters long in an adult. The esophagus moves food and liquids (including saliva, liquid from the mouth, and stomach acid) from the mouth to the stomach. Peristalsis, or the wave-like contractions of the esophageal muscles, causes food and liquids to progress through the esophagus. The esophagus has several layers. The wall of the lower part of the esophagus contains a hormone-secreting gland that secretes a hormone called insulin. The esophagus has natural defense mechanisms. Mucus, saliva, and stomach acid help kill foreign substances (such as bacteria or viruses) in the digestive tract.
There are four main types of cancer that arise in the esophagus. These are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, gastric carcinoma and lymphoma. The squamous cell carcinomas arise in the upper 1/3 of the esophagus. Adenocarcinomas arise in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus.
People who smoke or use tobacco are at risk of developing throat cancer. Excessive alcohol use also increases risk. Smoking and drinking alcohol combined lead to an increased risk for throat cancer."

"Lynch syndrome, also known as HNPCC, is a genetic condition caused by changes to the DNA that help protect the body against cancer. People with Lynch syndrome have a much higher risk of developing certain types of cancer, especially ovarian and colorectal cancer. It's important for people with Lynch syndrome to work closely with their doctors to monitor for and detect cancer early, when it's most treatable. There are also steps people with Lynch syndrome can take to lower their risk of developing cancer, such as regular check-ups, a healthy diet, and exercise.","Unfortunately, there is not enough data to provide a specific answer. However, it usually takes about 3-5 years from the time of diagnosis to develop cancer. The risk of developing cancer is about 50% for both males and females. Some people may never develop cancer. Because of the nature of this syndrome, patients should consider prophylactic surgery. This means that people with Lynch syndrome should have their colonoscopy at an earlier frequency (for example, every 2 years) and consider prophylactic colectomy (surgical removal of part of or all of the colon). Other recommendations include more frequent screening for endometrial and ovarian cancer. Please consult your doctor to determine the frequency of screening and the type of prophylactic surgery that is right for you. It is also important to tell your doctor about your family history so that they can provide you with the best care possible.","It is a hereditary cancer prediction and screening tool. It predicts the probability of developing cancer in a patient with known hereditary cancer syndromes like lynch syndrome. It is mainly useful in deciding the frequency of screening and the type of screening tests for early detection of cancer in a patient with lynch syndrome.

For more details, please talk to your doctor.","In preparation for your upcoming surgery, we would like to provide you with some additional information about Lynch syndrome.

Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a genetic disorder caused by an inherited mutation in the DNA mismatch repair genes. The mutation makes it more likely for you to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Because colorectal cancer often begins as a polyp, you will need to have regular colonoscopies to screen for cancerous polyps.

Please consult with your doctor for further information.","Lynch syndrome, formerly known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a genetic condition that predisposes to cancer. It is characterized by a mutation in the DNA mismatch repair genes, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MLH3, and PMS2. 

People with Lynch syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, as well as cancers of the endometrium, ovaries, stomach, pancreas, and other organs. 

Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes. These genes are responsible for correcting errors that occur when DNA is replicated during cell division. When these genes are mutated, errors are not corrected, leading to the accumulation of mutations in cells. This mutational load eventually leads to the development of cancer.

Common symptoms of Lynch syndrome include colorectal polyps, urinary tract tumors, endometrial polyps, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers. 

There is no established system for the classification of Lynch syndrome. However, it may be classified into three subtypes: 

Professional history Lynch syndrome often presents in the context of family history of cancer. 

Physical examination may be remarkable for colonic polyps, uterine leiomyomata, and ovarian cysts. 

Laboratory findings Laboratory findings in Lynch syndrome include abnormal pap smear, elevated serum tumor markers, and microsatellite instability. 

Imaging findings Imaging findings in Lynch syndrome include colonic polyps and cranial MRI for brain metastasis. 

Other diagnostic studies Other diagnostic studies for Lynch syndrome include immunohistochemistry and genetic testing. 

Treatment Treatment for Lynch syndrome includes prophylactic surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. 

Prophylactic surgery Prophylactic surgery includes total colectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.","Lynch syndrome, formerly known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a genetic condition caused by an inherited mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes. The most common symptom is colorectal cancer, but can also be associated with cancers of the endometrium, ovaries, stomach, pancreas, urinary tract, and biliary tract. It is an autosomal dominant syndrome, meaning that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent in order to develop the disorder. Individuals with Lynch syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, and are at risk of developing cancer at a younger age than people with non-hereditary forms of cancer. Early detection and prevention through prophylactic surgery can greatly reduce the risk of developing cancer. The risk of developing cancer is estimated by the Hamartoma syndrome database to be between 45% and 90% for colorectal cancer, 26–63% for endometrial cancer, 18–40% for ovarian cancer, 10–25% for stomach cancer, 25–40% for biliary cancer, 10–20% for pancreatic cancer, and 10–15% for urinary tract cancer. The lifetime risk of cancer for individuals with Lynch syndrome is greatly increased compared with the general population. It has been estimated that the risk of developing cancer is between 35% (for endometrial cancer) and 75% (for colorectal cancer) higher than the risk for the general population. The risk of colorectal cancer is 47% higher, the risk of endometrial cancer is 53% higher, the risk of ovarian cancer is 76% higher, the risk of stomach cancer is 80% higher, the risk of biliary cancer is 79% higher, the risk of pancreatic cancer is 78% higher, and the risk of urinary tract cancer is 69% higher.

The specific treatment option will depend on the severity of the condition, and the symptoms presented by the patient. 

For spina bifida, one option is surgery to close the opening in the spine. This can help prevent further damage to the nervous system. 

For vertebral fusion, another surgery can be performed to correct the abnormal curvature of the spine. This can help alleviate pain and pressure on the spinal cord. 

Syrinx tethered cord can be treated with surgery to remove the fluid build up in the spine, which can alleviate pressure on the spinal cord.

a. The most commonly performed surgery is Posterior cordotomy in which the tethered cord is visualized and released from its attachment to the bottom of the skull.
b. Since the procedure is performed under X ray, a fluoroscope is used to localize the exact site of tethering. A small incision is made on the back, and the skin and muscles are retracted to expose the pedicle. The pedicle is then removed, and the cord is visualized and manipulated to free it from the tethered position. The cord is then replaced in the spinal canal and the wound is closed.

So it would be best for you to consult your pediatrician about this.","16 months old is pretty young for a child to be diagnosed with PMG. It is a congenital condition and the brain cannot overcome this condition as such. However, with proper intervention, training and therapy, the child can develop normally.

"1. Do not lift heavy weights.
2. Avoid straining while defecating and urinating.
3. Wear a truss. (A truss is a device that puts pressure on the weakened muscle to keep the hernia from bulging out.)
4. Have surgery to repair the hernia. Most hernias can be repaired with open surgery. Open surgery means that the surgeon makes a larger cut in your abdomen to access the hernia. Some hernias can be repaired using a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a thin tube with a camera and a light on the end, which allows the surgeon to see inside your abdomen. The surgeon makes up to three smaller cuts in your abdomen and inserts the laparoscope. Then the surgeon uses special instruments to repair the hernia. Both open surgery and laparoscopic surgery require general anesthesia. General anesthesia puts you to sleep.
5. Have hernia repair surgery as soon as possible to reduce the risk of complications.","1. Reduce your weight if you are overweight.

Get a physical exam. A doctor can check to see if the hernia is strangulated (the loop of bowel is stuck inside the hole in the abdominal wall and its blood supply has been cut off). If it is, you'll need immediate surgery.
2.  Have tests. You may need blood tests, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.
3.  Get on the operating schedule. You'll need to wait until the doctors can operate on you. In some cases, you may be too sick for surgery.
4.  Repair the hernia. The surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen, push the bowel back inside, and close the hole with stitches.
5.  Stay still. Once the surgery is done, you can't move around for a while. You'll have to keep your wound clean and prevent it from getting infected, which means keeping still and not rubbing the area.
6.  Recover. It will take about 6 weeks for you to fully recover from the surgery. You'll have to avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first 2 months. You'll also have to avoid any exercise that makes you hold your breath and bear down with your abdominal muscles.","1. If there is no redness, tenderness or bulging, then you may be able to wait for weeks or months for an appointment with a surgeon. In some cases you may be told to wear a hernia truss or to avoid heavy lifting.
2. If redness, tenderness or bulging is present, or if a bulge appears during sleep, you should seek medical care immediately. You may need surgery to prevent the hernia from getting worse.
3. To help prevent hernias, you should avoid heavy lifting, particularly if you have a family history of hernias. Also, you should not lift while standing and should always stand straight with both feet on the ground when lifting. Also, you should not lift while coughing or straining. You should also avoid straining when having a bowel movement.

"Dear [NAME],
Thanks for contacting me at Chat Doctor. The question about teen pregnancy is a very important one. It has effects on the life of the child, the parents, and the society as a whole.

Teen pregnancy is often the result of poor sex education. Teens do not know about contraception and do not understand the risks of sexual activity. They do not comprehend the changes that occur in the body during pregnancy and the effects on lifestyle.

Teen pregnancy is also the result of peer pressure and a desire to be accepted by their friends. Teens want to be like their friends and will engage in risky behavior such a sex without protection.

Teen pregnancy can also be the result of low self-esteem. Teens who do not feel good about themselves will engage in sex as a way to feel loved and accepted.

Teen pregnancy has many negative effects. The teen mother will often stop her education which leads to reduced opportunities in the future. The child will often suffer from poor nutrition and lack of attention which can lead to health and learning problems. The society suffers because these children grow up to be unproductive and a burden on the system.

The best way to prevent teen pregnancy is through sex education. Teens need to understand their bodies, the risks of sexual activity, and the options available such as contraception and adoption. They need to understand the consequences of their actions.

I hope that I was able to answer your questions. Please contact me again with your concerns.","1. No, not alone.  However, many women do become pregnant alone. It is important to note that being pregnant and becoming a parent are two different things.  Many women choose to be single mothers, and there are resources, like  https://www.unitedway.org/ that can help provide support and resources to mothers who make that choice. 
2. It depends on the laws in the country you live in.  In the United States, minors need parental consent to receive medical care, including prenatal care and childbirth.  If the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault, many countries have laws that do not require the reporting of the sexual assault in order to receive medical care.  If you are in need of medical care, it is important to tell your healthcare provider the truth about your situation. They are required to keep your information confidential. 
3. It depends on the laws in your country.  In the United States, there are laws that protect women who choose to have an abortion and keep that information confidential.

- Receiving public assistance
- Experiencing negative health outcomes for themselves and their children
- Experiencing higher levels of domestic violence
- Living in single-parent households
- Having a lower likelihood of completing high school and pursuing postsecondary education

In 2012, the most recent year for which data are available, the U.S. rate of teen pregnancy was 27.3 pregnancies per 1,000 females aged 15-19, down 34% from its recent high of 43 pregnancies per 1,000 females aged 15-19 in 1990, and down 6% from 2011.

2. Opinion:
Teen pregnancy is usually not planned and is often associated with negative emotional and economic outcomes for the teen parents and their children. Teen parents are more likely than older parents to have a second child while their first child is still young, which can result in larger families with fewer resources per child. Children of teen mothers are more likely to be born at low birthweight and to experience developmental delays and other health problems. Additionally, teen mothers are more likely than older mothers to drop out of school and to experience poverty as adults.

2) Complications can be prevented if they are detected early. 3) The vaccine is very effective in preventing the infection. 4) Since the child is 4 years old, he is probably immunized (at least 3 doses of vaccine are recommended). 5) As long as the child is not immunocompromised, the infection is usually mild. 6) I would not worry about the child, he is probably going to be fine. 7) I would worry about the people who are not immunized (such as adults or infants) that might be exposed to the child. They should be immunized if they are not already. 8) Rubella spreads by cough or sneeze. It is not a contact disease, such as measles. 9) Rubella is a dangerous disease for pregnant women (it might cause deformation on the fetus). 10) I would recommend to the grandparents to make sure that the child is up to date on his immunizations and to avoid exposing him to adults or infants that might not be immunized (such as immigrants or people that are not used to living in developed countries). 11) I would also recommend to the grandparents to make sure that they are up to date on their immunizations (such as the rubella vaccine).","4 years old is a bit young for the MMR vaccine, which is the usual vaccine given to children to protect them against measles, mumps, and rubella. The vaccine is about 90% effective, so there is a chance that even though he got one dose, he is not protected against rubella. Rubella is a serious disease in children, as it can cause swelling of the brain (encephalitis) and other organs. In adults, the symptoms are usually milder, but still not something to take lightly. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause defects in the baby. I hope that your grandson and his family are doing well, and that he gets the proper care if he is ill.
I hope this answers your question. I'd be happy to answer any others.","4-year-old children in Mexico should be fully vaccinated against Rubella. If they have received at least one dose of vaccine, then they are protected and you should not be alarmed. Rubella is a vaccine-preventable disease. I hope this helps.","4 years old is a little young to be vaccinated, so he probably doesn't have immunity. Rubella is a vaccine preventable disease. So I would suggest you to get vaccinated with MMR as soon as possible to prevent the disease. Also, if you are not vaccinated and not infected, you are not a source of infection for your grandson. So, you don't need to worry about your visit to Mexico. Hope this answers your question. If you have any additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.","4 years old is a bit young for the MMR vaccine, which is usually given at 1 year and 4 years of age, so that may be what happened.
Even though your grandson may have contracted rubella, he most likely will not show any symptoms. The reason for this is because the matonavirus that causes rubella only infects cells that have estrogen receptors. Since your grandson is only 4 years old, his body does not contain much, if any, estrogen. This is why most of the time, the disease is asymptomatic in children. The only symptoms that may arise are a low-grade fever, inflammation of the eyes, and enlarged lymph nodes. 
However, since rubella is a virus that can be prevented by vaccination, it is still important that your grandson gets vaccinated once he is back in the United States. This is to prevent him from contracting rubella again, which could possibly result in him showing symptoms.
I hope this answered your question.","4-year-old boy diagnosed with Rubella, which was confirmed with a blood test. He had a vaccine, but it may not have taken. He is currently in Mexico. Should you be taking precautions? Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection that is spread through respiratory droplets. It is highly contagious and can cause severe disease in a pregnant woman and her fetus. The best way to prevent Rubella is through vaccination. If your grandson had a vaccine, then the likelihood of him spreading the virus is much lower. However, if the vaccine was not effective, or if your grandson was exposed to an infected person, he could still spread the virus. The disease can be prevented by avoiding exposure to anyone who may be infected. It can also be treated with medication if exposure occurs. I would recommend consulting with your healthcare provider to determine if any action is necessary. I hope this helps."
"The recovery after stroke is usually slow or non-existent. This is because the brain damage caused by the stroke is usually irreversible. It is common for the patient to undergo physical, occupational or speech therapy to help improve their condition.","The typical pattern of recovery after a stroke is somewhat variable, but in general, the prognosis is good. Most patients begin to regain function within the first few weeks, and many are able to return to their normal level of independence by 3-6 months. It's important to note, however, that some patients may experience residual deficits, and others may require ongoing rehabilitation or support to manage their symptoms.","It depends on the type of stroke and the part of the brain that is
  affected. For example, if the right side of the brain is affected,

There are, however, things that can be done to make the patient as comfortable as possible while dealing with this disease.  One of the most important things is to keep the patient well HY Chat Doctor.  This can be done through regular consumption of water and electrolytes.  The patient will also need to eat a healthy diet which may include foods high in potassium such as bananas, avocados, and coconut water.  It is also important that the patient not become constipated which can be helped through regular exercise and use of a stool softener.  Some ALS patients may benefit from use of a soft diet which may slow the deterioration of the teeth.  It is also important that the patient not become dehydrated which can be helped through regular intake of water and electrolytes.

"1. Here are a few things you can do to treat vitiligo at home: -Use moisturizers to prevent skin from drying and becoming more pale. Some moisturizers have sunscreen in them, which may help protect the skin from sun damage. -Try not to wear clothing that covers up your skin. This way, you can let the parts of your skin that aren't affected by vitiligo get exposed to the sun. -Get some sun exposure, but be careful not to get too much sun. Too much sun can cause more skin damage. -Try not to worry. Stress can make skin problems worse. -Some medicated make-up can help cover the pale skin. 2. Your doctor may prescribe some medicines that can help treat vitiligo. These medicines include: -Medicines that affect immune system function. For example, your doctor might prescribe drugs called corticosteroids. These are used to reduce inflammation and slow skin cell death. -Oral or topical (applied to the skin) forms of vitamin D analogs, which help the skin cells stay alive. -Creams with a steroid in them. -UVA/UVB light therapy. This therapy is used to stimulate the skin to produce more pigment. 3. Surgery is another option to treat vitiligo. Your doctor might suggest grafting, which involves taking normal-pigmented skin from another part of your body and attaching it to the pale skin. This helps the normal pigment grow over the affected area. Another surgery option is called PUVA therapy. This therapy involves taking a medicine called psoralen and then exposing the skin to UV light. This is used to slow skin cell death and stimulate pigment production.","1. Don't be too direct. Indirectness and subtlety are key. You don't want to make the other person feel uncomfortable.
2. Use implication and suggestion. For example, you could mention that you have read an interesting article about Vitiligo. Or you could share an anecdote about someone you know who has Vitiligo.
3. Be non-judgmental. It's important to convey that you are interested in the person, not their skin condition.
4. Be a good listener. Give the other person plenty of opportunity to talk about their feelings and concerns.","1. Avoid stereotypes: Vitiligo can affect anyone, so don't assume you know how someone with Vitiligo looks. 2. Be understanding: Having Vitiligo can be challenging, so be supportive and open to discussing any concerns your friend may have. 3. Be respectful: Your friend with Vitiligo may have questions about their condition, so be respectful as they seek information. 4. Be positive: Encouragement and optimism can go a long way in helping someone with Vitiligo.","1. Start by telling them that you have noticed that their skin coloring is different in certain areas.
2. Tell them that you have been reading about a condition called Vitiligo, and that it sounds like it might be affecting their skin.
3. If they seem open to discussing it, then continue to inform them about Vitiligo, and how it affects people.","1. Don't stare! 2. Try not to touch the areas that are affected. 3.

"There is information on the withdrawal symptoms when stopping pregabalin.  The information states that there have been rare reports of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of pregabalin. These have included insomnia, anxiety, subjective tinnitus, headache, and tremor. The information also states that after stopping pregabalin, the drug may continue to be effective for up to 12 days. It is recommended to taper the dose of pregabalin when discontinuing the medication.","There is no information available on the withdrawal symptoms experienced when stopping pregabalin.  However, when discontinuing pregabalin, do so gradually to minimize any potential withdrawal symptoms.  If you have been taking pregabalin for a long period of time, discuss a gradual discontinuation with your doctor.   It is important to talk to your doctor about the best way to stop taking pregabalin.","1. The reason for the lack of information on pregabalin withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing the medication is that it is rarely discontinued. 

2. When pregabalin is discontinued, the most common reason is because it is no longer covered by the insurance company.

3. The second most common reason is that it is no longer effective for the patient's condition.

4. The third most common reason is that the patient experiences adverse effects such as dizziness, sedation, and somnolence.

5. However, despite being rarely discontinued, there have been reports of withdrawal seizures when pregabalin is discontinued abruptly.

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","I take pregabalin 150 mg twice a day for neuropathic pain. I've taken it for about 3 weeks and feel it's helping but I'm concerned about dependence and what will happen if I stop taking it. 

Good question. Unfortunately we don't have any data on what happens when people stop taking pregabalin. That being said, it is important to know that the medication you are taking is a type of medication known as a gabapentin. It acts on a specific type of neurotransmitter in the brain known as VDCCs or voltage dependent calcium channels. It is thought that by blocking these channels, pain is reduced. Unlike opioids, the body does not become tolerant to it. That means that you can't take more and more to get the same effect. However, it is possible that if you stop taking it, your pain may return. 

Unfortunately, the FDA has issued recalls on several lots of pregabalin due to impurity. This means that you may not be getting the actual medication that you think you are taking. This is why it is important to take medications that have been prescribed by a licensed physician who can oversee your dosing and ensure that you are taking the medication responsibly. It is also important to ensure that the medications you are taking are safe and effective. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't know what happens when people stop taking pregabalin. This is because it has not been well studied. However, the medication is thought to be effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain.","The reason why there is no information provided on the withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping pregabalin is that it is not expected to cause withdrawal symptoms. 

As a helpful doctor, I can reassure you that pregabalin is unlikely to cause withdrawal symptoms because it is associated with relatively low abuse potential and a low risk of dependence.

However, discontinuation of pregabalin should be done gradually to avoid sudden discontinuation, especially when pregabalin is being taken for seizure or epilepsy. The dose should be reduced and then discontinued gradually to avoid increased seizure frequency.",There is no information provided on what symptoms may occur when pregabalin is discontinued.
"Advair and Spiriva should not be used together.  They both contain a control medicine (MDI) and a bronchodilator (SDD).  However, the control medicine in each is different.  It is important to consult with your doctor to determine which medication is best for you.","I understand your concern and would like to review the history of these 2 medications.
Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) is a metered dose inhaler with a spacer device used for control of asthma symptoms.
Spiruiva (tiotropium) is an inhaler used for control of asthma symptoms caused by excessive bronchoconstriction.
The Chest Physicians and Surgeons do not recommend the use of these 2 medications together however, they do not rule out the use of these medications individually if the patient is failing to control their asthma symptoms.
It is important to mention that the combination of Advair and Spiruiva is not indicated for use together and the combination has not been studied for safety or efficacy.
The use of these medications individually must be evaluated by a healthcare provider to ensure safety and efficacy.
I hope this answer helps you. Please feel free to ask for more details. I wish you the best health.","Thank you for asking in Chat Doctor. Advair and Spiriva both are for asthma. Spiriva is a long acting control medication, while Advair is a short acting control medication. So, generally both are not taken together. You may discuss with your doctor for your requirement. If your asthma is not controlled with one medication, your doctor may prescribe additional medication. Hope this is helpful to you.","Yes, it is common to use a leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist (LTRAs) in combination with a long-acting β2 agonist (LAB) for the treatment of asthma. The combination of an LTRA and a LAB is believed to have a synergistic effect in controlling asthma symptoms. Both Advair and Spiriva are examples of this type of combination therapy. However, it is important to note that the combination of LAB and LTRA should not be used for acute asthma control, which should be managed with short-acting beta-agonists.",I understand your concern. Both Advar and Spirvit are effective in asthmatic patients as a control medication. But we give based on the patients requirement. If the patient is not responding to one medication then other can be added. So please talk to your doctor and add the medication based on your requirement. Hope this helps. If you have any more queries I am happy to answer.,"Yes, it is safe to use Advair and Spiriva in tandem. Both medications are classified as control medications and are commonly used together in the treatment of asthma. Control medications work by reducing inflammation in the airways, which can help prevent symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. While it is important to note that individual responses to medication can vary, in general, combining Advair and Spiriva is considered a safe and effective approach to managing asthma. That said, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment based on individual circumstances."
"Answer: Hello. I am sorry to hear that you have Kartagener's syndrome. It is a genetic disorder that affects the cilia (the tiny hair like structures that move mucus) in the respiratory tract. Because of this, people with Kartagener's syndrome may have fertility problems due to the abnormal development of the cilia in the testes and ovaries. The condition can also cause other symptoms, such as sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, and recurrent ear, throat and lung infections. It is important to note that some people with Kartagener's syndrome may not have any symptoms at all. If you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to help. You can contact me through Chat Doctor. Best wishes,","I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis.  Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that results from a recessive gene.  This means that both your parents must carry the gene in order for you to inherit the disorder.  Since you have the disorder, we can assume that both your parents are carriers of the gene.  Kartagener's syndrome is also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia.  It is characterized by a lack of or very minimal ciliary movement.  These are tiny hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract and help to move mucus and other debris out of the lungs.  As a result, individuals with this disorder have chronic sinusitis and recurrent respiratory infections.  They may also experience episodes of bronchitis and pneumonia.  In addition, men with Kartagener's syndrome may experience infertility due to a condition called aspermia (absence of sperm in the semen).  Women with the disorder can have a normal fertility, but may experience miscarriages due to the chronic sinusitis and recurrent respiratory infections.  Other symptoms may include ear infections, hearing loss, and vertigo or dizziness.  Treatment for Kartagener's syndrome involves aggressive management of the chronic sinusitis and respiratory infections.  This may include the use of nebulizers, inhalers, and antibiotics.  In addition, individuals with the disorder may require the use of artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization to conceive.  I hope this information has been helpful.  Please contact us again with any further questions or concerns.","Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is characterized by a triad of clinical manifestations, including situs inversus (reversal of the organs in the chest and abdomen), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis (an abnormal proliferation of bronchial tubes). Kartagener's syndrome can also lead to a decrease in fertility. The decreased fertility is thought to be due to chronic sinusitis, which can cause nasal polyps and lead to obstruction of the upper airway. Other symptoms of Kartagener's syndrome may include recurrent infections, cough, and wheezing. Treatment for Kartagener's syndrome typically involves managing the symptoms, such as through surgery to correct nasal polyps or antibiotics to treat infections.","1.Infertility: It is due to the blockage of the fallopian tubes by the inflammatory cells.

"As the macular degeneration primarily affects the central vision, it may not cause dizziness. However, there may be a slight possibility that it may cause dizziness if it affects the peripheral vision as well. I would suggest you to consult your ophthalmologist for further assessment and management. Regards","No, it is common for macular degeneration to affect both eyes. Although the condition is most often diagnosed in only one eye, it commonly affects both eyes. About 15 percent of people with macular degeneration will develop it in the other eye within five years of being diagnosed. Some researchers believe that the real number may be higher, because diagnosing the condition in one eye may prompt doctors to more closely monitor the other eye, leading to an early diagnosis in that eye as well. Vision can be affected in one eye, however, if the disease is in an early stage or has a mild progression.","It's unlikely that macular degeneration in one eye would cause dizziness. The macula is responsible for central vision, which is necessary for tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. However, the macula does not receive visual information about balance and spatial orientation. Peripheral vision from the other eye and other systems, such as the inner ear, provide this information. 

Macular degeneration is a common condition in older adults and can lead to vision loss, but it would have to affect both eyes to cause dizziness. If you are experiencing dizziness, it is important to speak with your doctor to determine the underlying cause, which could be anything from a vision problem to a cardiovascular or neurological condition.","It is not associated with macular degeneration. There is no proven association between macular degeneration and dizziness. Common causes of dizziness are more likely.

Check your blood sugar. Any sharp drop in blood sugar can cause dizziness.

"200 mg Allopurinol is a relatively low dose. The usual dose in patients with gout is 300-600 mg daily. Allopurinol is used to lower uric acid levels in the blood to prevent gout attacks and reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.
The swelling of your feet is probably due to uncontrolled hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood). You should consult your doctor and increase the dose of Allopurinol. In some cases, it may be necessary to add other medications such as diuretics to lower blood pressure and reduce swelling.","200 mg of Allopurinol is a low dose, and I would expect you to experience more swelling as the dose is increased.  Allopurinol works by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase that is involved in the production of uric acid.  

If the swelling is due to uric acid crystal deposition, which is a common
  cause of gout, then the diuretic would be useful in reducing the amount
  of uric acid in the body.  Diuretics lower the levels of uric acid by
  increasing the excretion of uric acid by the kidneys.  

So I would say that a diuretic is safe to take in this situation, as it can help to reduce the levels of uric acid in the body and alleviate the swelling.","200 mg of allopurinol is a low dose, I would expect some swelling from gout even with a diuretic.  You should consult with your doctor and possibly increase the dose of allopurinol or add another gout medication like colchicine.","200 mg of Allopurinol is a low dose, and I would increase it to at least 300 mg before considering the addition of a diuretic. There are two main concerns with starting a diuretic in someone with gout. First, diuretics can increase the risk of lowering blood cell counts, and in someone with a low white blood cell count, that risk is elevated even further. Allopurinol itself can also lower white blood cell counts, so the combination could be quite problematic. The second concern is that diuretics can increase the risk of hypokalemia, or low potassium levels, which can be dangerous to the heart and muscles. Allopurinol also increases the risk of hypokalemia, so again, the combination could be quite problematic. So I would increase the Allopurinol dose before considering a diuretic. If you are unable to control swelling with 300 mg of Allopurinol, you should consult with a rheumatologist, as you may need a higher dose or additional medications to control your gout.","200 mg of Allopurinol is a low dose and there are  two possibilities in your case :  increase the dose of Allopurinol (after consulting your doctor) or add a diuretic. The second possibility seems more relevant because diuretics are often used in association with Allopurinol for the treatment of gout. Actually, diuretics have two effects: the diuretic effect of course, which consists in increasing the excretion of water and electrolytes, and the decrease of uric acid excretion. So, diuretics can help reduce uric acid levels in the blood and prevent gout attacks. The most commonly used diuretic in association with Allopurinol is hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The dose of HCTZ varies from 25 to 50 mg daily depending on the response. I hope this answer was helpful.","200 mg of allopurinol is a low dose and it can be combined with a diuretic without any worries. Make sure you tell your doctor about this medication so he can check your kidney functions to ensure they are healthy. Also, ensure you are properly HY Chat Doctor."

"50 mg of tramadol taken twice daily is relatively weak. Tramadol is an opioid painkiller that is commonly used for chronic pain. The typical daily dose ranges from 100-200 mg, taken once or in several divided doses. 50 mg taken twice daily is below the typical range and may not be effective for strong pain relief. It is often used as a starter dose or as an adjunct to other pain medications.

"Plaquenil is not a quinolone.  Plaquenil is an anti-malarial drug that acts by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.  This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of pyrimidines, which are components of DNA.  By inhibiting this enzyme, Plaquenil blocks the synthesis of DNA, which is essential for the survival of malarial parasites. 
The quinolones are a class of antibiotics that are derived from quinol, which is a component of NAD (coenzyme NAD).  The quinolones have antibacterial activity, and they work by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. 

So, Plaquenil and quinolones are structurally unrelated and have different mechanisms of action.","Plaquenil is an old medication that is not used very often anymore because of side effects and interactions. It is a member of the same class of medications as levofloxacin, but should not have the same effects on lupus patients.

If your doctor believes that this medication would be helpful in managing your lupus, then you should not be worried about taking it. That being said, you should talk to your doctor about other medication options if you are concerned.","Plaquenil is metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzymes to its active form.
  The metabolism of hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may be inhibited by

Yes, it is safe choice for you.
The concern is valid, however, in patients with lupus the use of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is suggested rather than dangerous.
The mechanism of action of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is not related to the mechanism of action of levofloxacin or other quinolones.
Quinolones inhibit cytochrome p450 enzymes. Cytochrome p450 enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) to its active form.
Hence, the use of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) along with quinolones may lead to an increased level of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) in the body which may lead to toxicity since the active form of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) can accumulate.
However, the use of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is suggested rather than dangerous in patients with lupus.

Mechanism of Action","1. Plaquenil is quite different from levofloxacin  

A quinolone is a type of antibiotic which is synthetic while quinine is naturally occurring. Both have the same basic structure, but the synthetic version is produced in a lab and usually much more potent than the natural version.

Plaquenil is a naturally occurring substance derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.  The chemical structure of plaquenil is similar to that of quinine, another compound derived from cinchona bark that's used to treat malaria, but the two drugs have different effects.

Plaquenil is used to treat lupus because it acts as an anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory agent. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that cause inflammation and pain.

2. Plaquenil is generally well tolerated but has potentially serious side effects.

The most common side effects of Plaquenil include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.

Serious side effects are rare, but may include liver damage, skin reactions (including sunburn and sensitivity to sunlight), and blood disorders.

Because Plaquenil may take several weeks - or even months - to take effect, it's important to report any side effects to your doctor right away.

3. Plaquenil is considered an effective, relatively safe medication for lupus.

Plaquenil is generally considered safe and effective for treating lupus, especially for patients who can't take other medications because of side effects or interactions.

While some patients may experience gastrointestinal side effects or skin reactions, Plaquenil is generally well tolerated.

"If you are vaccinated at childhood, do you need to get the vaccine again if you are going to country where there is a measles epidemic? No, you do not need to get the vaccine again. You should still be immune to the virus. However, in some cases, you may need a booster dose of the vaccine. Check with your doctor to see if you fall into that category. It is important to keep track of vaccinations throughout your life. You should have a copy of your vaccination history on file with your doctor or at the very least, a record of the vaccines you have received.

The reason for this is that measles vaccines are not 100% effective, and so there is still a small chance you could contract the disease, especially if you're exposed to it multiple times. Receiving another dose of the vaccine can help to protect you from developing measles, and is recommended by healthcare professionals for individuals who will be traveling to areas with active measles outbreaks.","Answer:Yes. At least one dose of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine is necessary to prevent measles. Two doses offer significantly greater protection.

Measles is a serious disease that causes fever, cough, and a rash. It is so contagious that an infected person can spread it to others before they even know they have it.

People who get two doses of the MMR vaccine are protected for life. Those who get one dose, even if it is before 1989, need another dose to make sure they are protected. Children should get their first dose of MMR at 1 year of age and a second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults who have not gotten measles since they were vaccinated should get another dose.

You should not get measles vaccine if you are pregnant or moderately to severely ill. However, in most cases, getting the vaccine is safer than getting measles.

If you are planning to travel, especially overseas, check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you are not protected.

"1. I am not sure if I have understood your question correctly. But, if you are asking if trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is useful in inflammatory arthritis, then the answer is Yes. 
It is commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides like gout, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), etc. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is a fixed dose combination of two drugs- trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim works by blocking the production of substances that cause inflammation. Sulfamethoxazole works by blocking the production of substances that cause inflammation and inhibiting the growth of bacteria. 
However, this combination therapy is contraindicated in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal problems like excessive diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, etc. It is also contraindicated in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy is usually recommended in an inflammatory arthritis when there is no response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or when the individual cannot tolerate the side effects of NSAIDs. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy is typically started at a lower dose and gradually increased, depending on the individual's response to the therapy and side effects. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, etc. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy may also affect the blood cells in the body and cause side effects like anemia, neutropenia, etc.

The following information was derived from the study titled:
A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Response Evaluation of Once-Daily Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets in Subjects With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

Efficacy:

The primary efficacy measure in this study was the total score on the
  ITI CDRS. The mean change from baseline to endpoint in the total score
  of the ITI CDRS was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
  with baseline score as a covariate. A significant treatment effect
  (p=0.0012) was observed, indicating that guanfacine ER tablets
  administration resulted in a significant reduction of ADHD symptom
  severity. The mean changes from baseline for the active treatment
  groups are provided in Table 10. The within-group standard deviations
  for the active treatment groups ranged between 12.4 and 16.0, and the
  within-group minimal changes ranged between 15.7 and 20.7 for the
  active treatment groups. The changes from baseline tended to be
  slightly larger in the two 4 mg/day groups than in the 2 mg/day group,
  although these differences were not statistically significant.

Safety:

The most common adverse events (≥ 5% incidence) were sedation,
  nausea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and abnormal dreams. The most
  common adverse events that were possibly or probably related to
  study drug were sedation, fatigue, decreased appetite, and nausea.

Guanfacine is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. It is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Guanfacine can help adults with ADHD to control their symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. This medication can improve focus, organizational skills, and reduce impulsive behavior. Guanfacine is thought to work by reducing the activity of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating attention and behavior. It is important for adults with ADHD to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for their individual needs.","Yes, adults with ADHD may see benefits from taking long-acting Guanfacine tablets. Guanfacine is a medication that is commonly prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is thought to work by reducing the levels of dopamine in the brain, which can help to increase attention and decrease impulsivity. While Guanfacine is primarily used to treat children with ADHD, it may also be used in adults with the condition. Long-acting Guanfacine tablets are designed to release slowly over time, which can help to prevent peaks and valleys in concentration and energy levels. Like all medications, Guanfacine may have side effects and interactions, so it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of treatment.","As an adult with ADHD, I can tell you first hand the benefits of using guanfacine for ADHD.  The biggest benefit is that it helps to regulate my mood.  It has a calming effect and reduces impulsivity.  It also helps me to focus and be more productive.  Guanfacine is different than other ADHD medications because it affects the dopamine and norepinephrine systems in the brain.  It's not a stimulant, so it doesn't have the same side effects as stimulants like Adderall.  The only downside is that it can be expensive, but there are often patient assistance programs available from the manufacturer to help offset the cost.",The safety and effectiveness of guanfacine extended-release tablets in adult patients with ADHD have not been established.,The long acting guanfacine tablets are effective in providing benefits for adults with ADHD.

It is important to follow the dosage and duration of treatment recommended by the physician to ensure the best possible outcome.","It's generally not recommended. The effectiveness of tetracycline decreases over time. It's best to take the freshest medication, with the highest efficacy. Outdated medications may be less effective, and more likely to cause side effects. Always follow the prescribing doctor's instructions, and ask how to properly dispose of unused medication.",The implications of taking outdated tetracycline include demyelination and death.,"Tetracycline is not safe to take. It has been linked to several serious side effects, including heightened risk of developing skin cancer. If you are currently taking tetracycline, talk to your doctor about switching to a different antibiotic.","Yes, taking outdated tetracycline can be harmful. Tetracycline is a medication that is used to treat bacterial infections such as acne, respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections. However, if tetracycline is taken beyond its expiration date, it may lose its effectiveness and become less safe and secure. Taking expired tetracycline can also increase the risk of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and liver damage. Therefore, it is important not to take tetracycline that has expired and to consult with a healthcare provider if any concerns or questions about the medication arise."

"The mechanism of action of acetaminophen (paracetamol) is not the same as that of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen.

Acetaminophen/Paracetamol inhibits cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes at a different site from NSAIDs. 


This leads to a different kind of pain relief, and reduced inflammation.


Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs inhibit COX enzymes, which are responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins (such as PGE2).

Prostaglandins are responsible for pain, fever, and inflammation.

Stop all medications that can irritate the stomach lining.  See a doctor immediately.  Start on a PPI like Prilosec or Aciphex and a proton pump inhibitor like Prilosec or Aciphex.  If you have had a previous ulcer, you may be having another one.  Symptoms of a peptic ulcer include pain on the upper left side or middle of the abdomen, early fullness while eating, bloating, burping, and waterbrash.  Symptoms of bleeding ulcers include vomiting blood, coffee ground like material, or yellow or green colored material.  Your doctor may do an upper endoscopy to check for an ulcer.  You may need a prescription strength PPI like Nexium or a combination of antacid and PPI like Prilosec CV.

Answer 2: Tylenol is known to cause peptic ulcers in some patients.  If you are having pain on the upper left side or middle of the abdomen, early fullness while eating, bloating, burping, waterbrash, or vomiting blood, coffee ground like material, or yellow or green colored material, you may be having peptic ulcers.  Stop all medications that can irritate the stomach lining.  Start on a PPI like Prilosec or Aciphex and a proton pump inhibitor like Prilosec or Aciphex.

This inhibition can lead to decreased mucosal defense mechanisms, increased H+ concentration in the stomach, and impaired healing of the ulcer.

The standard treatment for PUD is the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to inhibit COX and NSAIDs to decrease the production of prostaglandins. This therapy is effective because the NSAIDs promote healing of the ulcer by increasing bile acid secretion and improving mucosal blood flow.

The use of acetaminophen in the treatment of PUD is not as effective as NSAIDs, but it is used as an alternative therapy for patients who cannot take NSAIDs due to the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers, bleeding, and degradation of renal function. The use of acetaminophen in these patients does not result in a lack of efficacy due to inhibition of COX in the gastric mucosa. However, acetaminophen is not as effective as NSAIDs in promoting healing of the ulcer.

In conclusion, the use of acetaminophen in the treatment of PUD results in decreased promotion of healing of the ulcer, but it is still effective in relieving pain. The use of acetaminophen in patients with PUD is not contraindicated due to inhibition of COX in the gastric mucosa. However, NSAIDs are more effective in promoting healing of the ulcer and relieving pain.","Peptic ulcers are ulcers that occur in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine.  Peptic ulcers are very common and can occur due to infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), or due to long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  NSAIDs can increase the risk of developing peptic ulcers by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are necessary for maintaining the integrity of the mucous barrier lining the stomach and small intestine.  Prostaglandins help protect the stomach lining from the effects of acid.  Because Tylenol has nothing to do with the formation of peptic ulcer, the pain might be due to the H. pylori infection.  So, it is recommended to do gastrostomy to diagnose the real cause of the pain.","The active ingredient in Tylenol (also called acetaminophen) is not a pain reliever, but rather an anti-inflammatory agent.  It affects the production and actions of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that are involved in inflammation, pain, and fever.  Some but not all prostaglandins are also involved in the lining of the stomach and small intestine.  If too much Tylenol is taken, it can damage the stomach and intestines by reducing the protective lining of mucus that covers these organs.  This can lead to peptic ulcers.  
Peptic ulcers are sores or open lesions in the lining of the stomach and small intestine.  They are caused by an imbalance of several different types of prostaglandins.  The imbalance is caused by the effect of too much stomach acid on the prostaglandins, and the effect of too little stomach acid on the prostaglandins.  The result is a breakdown of the protective mucus lining of the stomach and intestines.  This leads to the formation of peptic ulcers. 

If you have had peptic ulcers in the past, it is safe to take acetaminophen, but you should avoid taking any other medications that can damage the stomach lining.  If you have ever had a peptic ulcer, you should make sure you are not taking any medications that can cause peptic ulcers.  In addition, you should not take large amounts of acetaminophen.  If you have questions about how much acetaminophen is safe for you to take, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist.","The reason for pain on the second day of taking Tylenol is that by the second day, the amount of inflammatory mediators (eg prostaglandins) that are being produced and being targeted by the Tylenol is greater.  So while on the first day you may have less inflammation than what is required to cause pain, by the second day the amount of inflammation has increased and is causing pain.  This is why doctors often prescribe doses of Tylenol around the clock, so that the pain from the inflammation is being treated as it happens as opposed to waiting for 24 hours for another dose.  Hope this helps!"
"1)  Nephrotic Syndrome is a condition characterized by proteinuria greater than 3.5g per 24 hours.
2)  Nephrotic Syndrome is caused by podocyte damage (glomerular charge hyper-positivity).
3)  Nephrotic Syndrome is treated with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide (nephrotoxic chemotherapy).","1. Membranous nephropathy
Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is caused by thickening of glomerular basement membrane. The thickening is usually caused by deposits of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane. The immune complexes are usually products of opsonizing antibodies and antigens. The antibodies are usually of IgG class. The antigens are usually intrinsic proteins of the basement membrane. The deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane causes thickening of the membrane and podocyte damage. The podocyte damage induces the glomerular basement membrane to become “leaky”. This allows large molecules, including albumin, to pass into the nephritic filtrate. The damage to the glomerular basement membrane causes nephrotic syndrome.
Membranous nephropathy is associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Grave’s disease. It is also associated with human monoclonal antibodies against phospholipid – protein complexes (e.g. anti-phospholipid syndrome). Membranous nephropathy can also be caused by non-immune mechanisms.
2. 2.2.2.2.2.2 Chronic infections
Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by chronic infections such as tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and chronic pyelonephritis. These infections can induce glomerular inflammation and damage, which induces glomerular basement membrane “leakiness”.
3. 2.2.2.2.2.3 Alport’s syndrome
Alport’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the glomerular basement membrane. It is characterized by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen. The mutations induce glomerular basement membrane defects, which induces podocyte damage and glomerular basement membrane “leakiness”.","1.  Membranous nephropathy 
Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is caused by thickening of glomerular basement membrane. The exact etiology of membranous nephropathy is not clear. It is thought that it may be the result of the following conditions:    Infections (HBV, HCV, CMV, Heparin) Drug-induced (coca, penicillamine, captopril, ACE inhibitors) Out of these, heparin is the most common cause. Membranous nephropathy may also be idiopathic. 
2.  MPGN II 
MPGN II is a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome. MPGN II is a genetic disorder characterized by deficiency of enzymes like glycogen phosphorylase. This leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in the kidney resulting in nephrotic syndrome. 
3.  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. FSGS is characterized by focal and segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli. It may be caused by the following conditions:  HIV, malignancy, interferon treatment, immunosuppressive therapy, malignancy, nephrotoxic drugs (coca, NSAIDs).","1. Nephrotic Syndrome is caused by problems with the glomeruli (the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys).
 2. The two main causes of Nephrotic Syndrome are:
    a) Membranous nephropathy (due to thickening of the glomerular basement membrane).
    b)  Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (due to inflammation of the glomerulus).

3. There are several classes of medication that can be used to treat Nephrotic Syndrome, including:
    a) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone), which are anti-inflammatory medications.
    b) Cyclophosphamide, which is an alkylating agent that suppresses the immune system.
    c) Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus.

"Dear Anonymous, I am sorry to hear about your family's health problems. To answer your question, however, I would have to have more information about the type and severity of the retardation and about the details of the scoliosis.  The diagnosis of periventricular heterotopia is not usually associated with either retardation or scoliosis, although retardation and scoliosis can sometimes be genetically linked.  There have been some reports of women with periventricular heterotopia having more severe scoliosis, but this is still a rare connection.  If you would like more information about this, please write me at bwu@chm.uiuc.edu.  I would also recommend that you consult with your family physician or a genetic counselor about your family's condition and about possible genetic testing.  Thank you for your question.","No, there are no known genetic correlations between periventricular heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis. 

Periventricular heterotopia is a congenital brain abnormality in which there are regions of brain tissue that are located outside of the brain's normal folds. It is generally considered to be a benign condition and does not typically cause symptoms.

Idiopathic scoliosis is a condition in which the spine curves sideways, usually starting in adolescence. It is not known what causes idiopathic scoliosis, and there are no known genetic correlations with other conditions. Idiopathic scoliosis can run in families, but this is likely due to shared environmental or other factors rather than genetics.","There is no proven relationship between periventricular heterotopia and scoliosis.
Scoliosis is a condition where the spine has a sideways curvature. It can be caused by various factors such as genetics, growth problems, and spinal cord disorders like muscular dystrophy.
Periventricular heterotopia, on the other hand, is a type of brain abnormality where there are areas of brain tissue that are located outside the brain ventricles. It is usually asymptomatic and does not cause any health problems.
While there are some case reports of periventricular heterotopia in patients with scoliosis, there have been no studies that have proven a connection between the two. It could be a coincidence or may be related to other factors. If you have concerns about this, it is best to consult with a doctor.","No, there is no recognized correlation between periventricular heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis. 

Periventricular heterotopia is a prenatal brain anomaly, characterized by an abnormal cluster of brain cells near the ventricles of the brain. It is typically asymptomatic, but can be associated with an increased risk of developing epilepsy.

Idiopathic scoliosis is a postnatal deformity of the spine, characterized by a sideways curvature of the spine. It is typically asymptomatic, but can cause back pain or respiratory problems if the curvature is severe.

While both conditions can be seen in families, there is no recognized correlation between periventricular heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis. The risk of developing idiopathic scoliosis is thought to be multifactorial, but it is not clearly associated with any specific genetic condition.","I am sorry but I don't think periventricular heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis are related. 
Heterotopia is a developmental anomaly of the brain and does not have any effect on the spine. 
On the other hand, scoliosis is a spinal deformity, where the spine has a C or S shape. It is due to the malfunction of the neural system, especially the pathways controlling the spinal muscles. 
There are no known direct causes for scoliosis, although several genetic factors have been found to be associated with it. These include genetic syndromes like Marfan syndrome, Euler-Clarke syndrome and others. 
Hence, there is no reason to believe that idiopathic scoliosis will be more common in people with periventricular heterotopia.

2) Laboratory studies have shown that D-limonene can kill cancer cells in test tubes (in vitro).

3) Some people with cancer have used D-limonene as a treatment, but there is no strong evidence from studies on humans that it works.

4) One small study found that D-limonene did not kill cancer cells in the laboratory.

5) A large study looked at the use of D-limonene, along with other related substances, in people with cancer. The study found that D-limonene and the other substances lowered the amount of a protein that indicates cancer in the blood. However, this result does not mean that D-limonene or the other substances affected cancer in any way.

6) None of the human studies on D-limonene or other related substances have shown that they can cure or control cancer in humans.","D-limonene is a naturally occurring chemical found in citrus fruits. Laboratory studies have shown that D-limonene is effective in killing cancer cells in test tubes, but research in humans is still in the early stages.
One study tested D-limonene on human cancer patients. Researchers gave 51 people with skin cancer a capsule containing D-limonene once a day for 3 months. The treatment caused no side effects and decreased the amount of cancer in 80% of the patients.
More study is needed to fully understand how D-limonene works in the body and whether it would be effective in people with other types of cancer.","1. D-limonene is a naturally occurring poly-functional molecule and a major constituent of citrus oils. It has been widely studied for its effectiveness in treating cancer.

2. In recent studies, D-limonene has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of skin cancer. It has been shown to induce apoptosis (cell death) in skin cancer cells and inhibit the growth and proliferation of these cells.

3. D-limonene has also been shown to modulate the expression of genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation, contributing to its anti-cancer effects.

4. Overall, D-limonene has been shown to be a promising treatment for skin cancer and may have potential for the treatment of other types of cancer as well.","As a helpful doctor, I would like to inform you that there has been significant research in the use of D-Limonene as a treatment for cancer, particularly skin cancer.

D-Limonene is a natural substance that is derived from oranges. It is believed to be an effective treatment for skin cancer due to its ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

Recent studies have shown that D-Limonene can effectively kill cancer cells, while having minimal effects on normal cells. This makes it an attractive option for those who are seeking natural treatments for skin cancer.

While more research is needed to fully understand the effects of D-Limonene on cancer, it is clear that it has significant potential as a treatment for this condition. Those who are interested in learning more about this treatment option should speak with their healthcare provider.","Limonene is a monoterpene, a naturally occurring chemical
  found in citrus fruits. Researchers have found that limonene
  inhibits the growth of cancerous cells and also breaks down
  cancer-causing chemicals.

Several laboratory studies have shown limonene to be toxic to
  cancer cells. One laboratory study tested the effects of
  limonene on cancerous human breast, colon, and skin cells in
  the lab. The researchers found that limonene killed the skin
  cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and did not affect
  normal cells.

Animal studies have also shown that limonene may help to
  prevent skin cancer. In one study, mice pretreated with limonene
  were less likely to develop skin cancer after exposure to a
  carcinogen. The study’s authors attributed the reduction in
  skin cancer incidence to limonene’s ability to increase the
  body’s defense against cancerous cells and its ability to
  break down cancer-causing chemicals.

Limonene is available as an oral supplement, but it is not
  regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a
  treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.
  Patients should discuss the use of limonene with their
  health care provider, and should be aware that limonene can
  interact with other medications. As with all cancer treatments,
  limonene may have side effects.

It is important to note that laboratory and animal study
  results are not always predictive of human response to the
  same substance. More research is needed to confirm the
  effects of limonene on human cancer cells."

I am so sorry to hear about the accident that has happened to your family member.  It is good that they are in the hospital getting treatment.  Caustic soda, also known as Sodium Hydroxide, is a very caustic substance.  It can cause severe burns and damage to the inside of the body if swallowed.  The treatment for this depends on how much was swallowed, and how long ago it was swallowed.  In general, when a large amount is swallowed, the treatment is to completely evacuate the stomach, and then treat the symptoms as they arise.  This is a very serious situation, and I hope that your family member gets the help that they need.  Again, I am sorry that this happened.","1. Rigorous gastric lavage

"After a hysterectomy, a woman is no longer at risk for cervical cancer, but she may still need to have a Pap smear performed.  It depends on the woman's age and the type of hysterectomy that she had.  If she had a total hysterectomy in which the cervix was removed, then she does not need to have a Pap smear performed.  If she had a partial hysterectomy in which the cervix was spared, then she will need to have a Pap smear performed every year.  Women over the age of 65 with no history of cervical cancer or precancerous lesions may no longer need to have a Pap smear performed, but this is determined on a case-by-case basis.  It is best for women to discuss their individual situation with their healthcare provider.","The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women without a uterus should not be screened for cervical cancer by Pap test, but they should be screened for vaginal and vulvar cancer by Pap test or by visualization of the cervix with colposcopy.

The reason behind this is that pap smear is done to check for cervical cancer and since you had a full hysterectomy, it is not necessary to continue getting pap smears. However, if your hysterectomy was not due to cervical cancer, then you need to continue getting pap smears. Also, if you have a history of cervical dysplasia, then you need to continue getting pap smears. You should consult an oncologist for more information.","Hello, since you had a hysterectomy, pap smear is not necessary anymore. However, we recommend performing a pelvic examination to exclude any other pathology.  Hope I have answered your query.

If you are over 65 with no previous abnormal pap smears you probably do not need a pap smear.  However, if you have had previous abnormal pap smears or you are under 65 you probably do need a pap smear.  I suggest you discuss this with your doctor.","For most women with a uterus, the guidelines call for a pap smear every 2 years. However, for women who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and have been cleared of cervical cancer, most guidelines now recommend stopping pap smears. This is because the cervix, where abnormal cells were removed during your hysterectomy, is the only place where you could develop cervical cancer. Without a cervix, you cannot develop cervical cancer. However, I would recommend speaking with your doctor about your specific medical history to determine what screening guidelines apply to you."

I'd be happy to share some details about HIV/AIDS treatment that might be relevant to your work. HIV treatment is a highly effective way to improve health and reduce the risk of HIV transmission. With proper treatment, most people with HIV are able to lead long and healthy lives.  Treatment for HIV/AIDS usually consists of a combination of medications, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The goal of HAART is to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to undetectable levels. This achievement is associated with a lowered risk of HIV-related illness and death. HAART is most often prescribed in the form of a fixed-dose combination therapy, and usually includes at least three drugs. Recent advances have further simplified treatment regimens. Instead of taking several pills every day, patients now have the option of taking a single pill twice a day.

We were wondering if you could give more information on the topic as it relates to our study. Our study aims to document the experiences of HIV-positive transgender women in Hollywood, particularly focusing on health care access and the unique challenges they face in this community. Any information you could provide on treatment options, potential side effects, and drug interactions would be extremely helpful. Thank you for your time and expertise!","1. What are the challenges that HIV-positive transgender women face in getting into care?
Many transgender women avoid seeking medical care due to prior negative experiences with medical providers and the health care system. Additionally, transgender women often face stigma and discrimination in health care settings, which can make it difficult for them to seek and maintain engagement in care. The social and structural stigma that transgender women face also often results in their having lower socioeconomic status and unstable housing, which can further impact their ability to access and maintain engagement in care.

2. What specific strategies have been effective in getting HIV-positive transgender women into care?
Outreach from peers and trusted individuals within the community have been found to be effective in connecting HIV-positive transgender women to care. Additionally, the use of culturally competent health care providers who are trained and experienced in working with transgender women can also help to reduce the barriers to care faced by this population. The provision of supportive services, such as transportation and childcare, can also help to increase the accessibility of health care for HIV-positive transgender women.

3. Are there specific considerations that health care providers should be aware of when caring for HIV-positive transgender women?
Yes, HIV-positive transgender women often have a history of trauma, which can impact their ability to seek and maintain engagement in care. It is important for health care providers to be aware of this history and to provide trauma-informed care to this population. Additionally, HIV-positive transgender women often have high rates of substance abuse and sex work, which can further impact their health and their ability to seek and maintain engagement in care. Health care providers should be aware of these factors and should work to provide care that is sensitive to the unique challenges faced by this population.","1) What are the main factors that contribute to the spread of HIV among the population?

Unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing of needles for drug use, blood transfusion or organ transplantation before 1985, mother to child transmission and artificial insemination with HIV infected semen.

2) What is the life cycle of HIV like?

HIV is a retrovirus which uses CD4 cell as a co-factor and replicates in activated T cells and macrophages. It mainly affects the CD4 cells and the immune system. CD4 cells are important for the activation and coordination of the immune response. HIV first infects these cells by binding to CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5. After entry into the CD4 cell, the viral capsid is released into the cell cytoplasm, and the viral RNA integrates into the host cell genome. Immediately after infection, the proviral HIV DNA synthesis is low and transcription is inefficient. Infected cells can remain healthy for long periods of time. But over time, the accumulating viral transcription and replication causes the host cell to die. The death of so many CD4 cells so profoundly impairs the body's immune system that the patient is left vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers, which are infections or tumors that would normally be harmless but can now cause severe disease. These opportunistic infections and cancers are therefore considered hallmarks of AIDS."

It's also contagious from the time someone starts showing symptoms but without rash to the time they get the rash. The virus can be spread through respiratory droplets (i.e. sneezing, coughing) or contact with the fluid inside the blisters (which is contagious before the blisters turn into crusts).
The time from being exposed to the virus to showing symptoms is 2-21 days (average is 7-14 days). The time from showing symptoms to developing the rash is 4-14 days (average is 7-10 days). So, the virus can be contagious from 2-28 days (average is 7-14 days).

So, to be safe, if you have any symptoms or rash, don't go back to work until the rash is gone. That should be at least 5 days (average is 7-10 days) after the symptoms started.
If you just showed signs of possible shingles but no symptoms or rash yet, then you are NOT contagious and can go back to work.
Hope I didn't make this too confusing. Let me know if you have any questions.","1. The virus can be spread through body fluids, such as saliva, before the rash appears. Therefore, you should keep your distance from others until the rash has developed (typically after 2-3 days from the onset of the other symptoms). 2. After the rash has developed, you should keep your distance from others unless the rash is covered with a bandage. Affected individuals remain contagious until the illness has run its course. Most people are no longer contagious after the first week of illness. 3. Covering the rash with a bandage does not make it safe to be around others. The virus is still able to pass through the bandage.","It is safe to resume work as an Airport employee when the crust stage of shingles has passed. At this stage, the virus is not contagious and you are no longer at risk of transmitting it to others. It is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as shingles, including washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others during the contagious phase of the illness. I hope this helps.","1. The infectious stages of varicella zoster (shingles) virus are the
  contagious stage (8th disease, chickenpox) and the non-contagious
  stage (shingles).
2. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant
  in the nervous system.
3. During the shingles phase, the virus may be transmitted to others
  through contact with the shingles rash, which is a blistered skin
  condition.
4. The virus may also be transmitted through airborne spread of the
  virus during coughing or sneezing, but this is uncommon.
5. Once someone recovers from shingles, the virus does not leave the
  body. After the shingles rash clears, the virus enters a new phase
  where it is transported throughout the body within the nervous
  system.
6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that
  individuals who are infected with VZV and are not vaccinated against
  shingles should avoid close physical contact with other people for
  at least 24 hours after the rash has formed crusts, which usually
  occurs 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms.
7. It is important to note that no vaccine is 100% effective nor is it
  effective for everyone.
8. The CDC recommends that individuals who are infected with VZV and
  are not vaccinated against shingles should avoid close physical
  contact with another person until the rash has formed crusts.
9. According to the CDC, it is not possible to exactly predict when the
  shingles rash will clear, but it usually takes 2 to 3 weeks after the
  start of symptoms.
10. The CDC recommends that individuals who are infected with VZV and
  are not vaccinated against shingles should avoid close physical
  contact with another person until the rash has formed crusts.
11. According to the CDC, the risk of transmitting the virus to another
  person is reduced after the bl","2. If you develop shingles, you could potentially spread the virus to others who are not immune, such as young children, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems. However, you are no longer contagious after the blister stage (when the blisters appear), so you may resume your duties at the airport once the blisters have formed. This typically occurs 2-3 weeks after symptoms start. It is important to wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading the virus to others. Good hand hygiene is important in all settings, but particularly in settings where you come into contact with large numbers of people, such as at an airport.","1. The shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine does not contain a live virus, so it cannot cause shingles.
2. However, if you have active shingles when you are exposed to someone who has not had chickenpox as a child or who has not gotten the chickenpox vaccine, you can cause them to develop chickenpox, rather than shingles. They would develop chickenpox, rather than shingles, if they have not had chickenpox as a child or if they have not gotten the chickenpox vaccine.
3. You are most likely to spread chickenpox to someone else from 1 day before the rash develops until 1-2 days after the rash develops.
4. This is particularly true for immunocompromised people.
5. The best way to prevent the spread of your illness is to wash your hands often, not to share your food or drink, and to stay home until your rash has formed blisters and changed from red to brown.
6. The airborne chickenpox virus can be transmitted for 1-2 weeks after the eruption of the rash.
7. Therefore, if you are exposed to someone who has active shingles, you should avoid work or school until your rash has formed blisters and changed from red to brown.
8. This will usually happen within 2 weeks of becoming infected.
9. If you are caring for someone with shingles, wash your hands often while caring for them.
10. If you are not immune to chickenpox, avoid close contact with that person.
11. If you are not immune to chickenpox and you come into close contact with someone who has shingles, contact your health care provider.
12. Within 24 hours, you can get a medicine called varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) that can help prevent chickenpox if you have not had chickenpox as a child or if you have not gotten the chickenpox vaccine.
13. This is especially important for people who have a weakened immune system or who are heavily exposed to chickenpox.

Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your bones where blood cells are made.
With chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. These extra lymphocytes may cause the bone marrow to stop making other blood cells.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of adult leukemia. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.
The cause of CLL is unknown. Most often, CLL gets worse slowly. It tends to start in older adults, usually around age 50. Although CLL is usually chronic and slow-growing, it can sometimes grow faster. The disease can then be harder to treat.","1. MedlinkPlus

It usually occurs in newborns (physiological jaundice), but may occur in older children and adults due to different causes such as hepatitis, drugs, cancer, etc.",0 to 2 months.,"Answer: Yes, older infants can develop jaundice. Generally, if it occurs, it happens between 2 and 6 weeks after birth.","Jaundice is a common condition in newborns, but it can occur at any age. Jaundice in an infant or child is an excess of bilirubin in the blood, which causes yellowing of the skin and eyes.

If your child shows signs of jaundice, it is important to contact your doctor to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment."
"1. Keep HY Chat Doctor.  If you cannot find a reason for the ulcers within 1-2 weeks, go to your dentist.
2. Stop spicy food.
3. If you have any kind of anemia, treat that.
4. If you are weak, take multivitamin tablets.
5. If there is no ulcer for 2 weeks, stop all these.
6. Apply Vaseline or any lip balm on the ulcers. This will protect from further ulcers.
7. If you have any ulcer for more than 1 week, go to your dentist.","1.  The most common cause of recurrent canker sores is stress.
2.  You seem to be a very stressful person, so I would suggest you try yoga and meditation.
3.  Also, your diet seems to be lacking in some vital nutrients so make sure you eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
4.  Also, make sure you are not anemic or thalassemic as both these conditions can cause canker sores.
5.  Avoid foods that trigger the canker sores. Common culprits include coffee, strawberries, and acidic foods such as oranges.","1. Canker sores are painful sores or open lesions in the mouth. They are approximately 1 mm in diameter and have a white or grayish base surrounded by a red halo. Canker sores usually resolve by themselves in a week or two. The underlying cause of canker sores is not known. Canker sores are not contagious. 

2. The most common cause of mouth ulcers is stress. When you are under stress, you might develop ulcers at the side of your mouth or on your tongue. The stress decreases the immunity and hence the healing process is delayed. 

3. Another common cause of mouth ulcers is vitamin deficiency. Vitamin deficiencies can cause ulcers in the mouth and other parts of the body. In particular, vitamin B deficiency can cause ulcers in the mouth.

4. Allergies to certain foods such as chocolate, strawberries, vanilla, or balsamic vinegar can cause mouth ulcers. 

5. Menstrual women are highly susceptible to have mouth ulcers. At this time, take more care of your oral hygiene.  

6. Another common cause of mouth ulcers is oral lichen plans. It is a harmless skin lesion that can appear on any mucous membrane, but most commonly affects the tongue.

7. Another common cause of mouth ulcers is tooth and gum infection. Always maintain good oral hygiene. 

8. Another common cause of mouth ulcers is hand foot mouth disease. Hand foot mouth disease (HFMD) is most commonly a viral infection that causes a rash of small blisters or ulcers on the hands, feet, and in the mouth. 

9. Stop alcohol and tobacco if you are having these habits. 

10. Mouth ulcers can also be a sign of certain diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or stomach cancer. Consult your doctor if the problem persists.","3-4 times a month is not a lot and it is good that you take care of your teeth and gums. It would be a good idea to have a dentist have a look in your mouth, as the ulcers may be related to your teeth and gums.
Some people suffer from canker sores in the mouth, which may be related to an allergy or a vitamin deficiency. You may want to look into this.
If the ulcers are related to your diet, you may want to avoid acidic foods and reduce spicy foods.","1. The most common cause of mouth ulcers is gingivitis, also inflammation of the gums.
2. The second most common cause of mouth ulcers is due to vitamin deficiency. In particular, vitamin B12 and vitamin C deficiency can cause mouth ulcers.
3. Other causes of mouth ulcers are due to allergic reaction to certain food, chicken pox, herpes simplex virus, stress, hormonal changes, smoking, and certain medications.
4. Mouth ulcers can be classified into three categories: syndromic, ulcerative, and erosive.
5. Treatment methods for mouth ulcers depends on the underlying cause. Gingivitis can be treated by having a scaling and root planing procedure done. Vitamin deficiency can be treated by having vitamin B12 and vitamin C supplements.
6. Maintaining good oral hygiene is very important to prevent and treat mouth ulcers. This includes brushing teeth at least twice a day, flossing once a day, and having a scaling done once every 6 months.
7. Having a balanced diet is also important to prevent deficiencies that can cause mouth ulcers. This includes eating fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C and vitamin B12.
8. Avoid smoking and having too much stress as they can trigger the occurrence of mouth ulcers.
9. If the mouth ulcers do not go away after 2 weeks, it is best to see a dentist to have a thorough examination and investigation done. The dentist can prescribe more medications and treatment methods to help get rid of the mouth ulcers.","3-4 ulcers a month is a fairly significant number and would cause significant discomfort and pain. The first thing I would recommend is that you see a dentist for an evaluation of the ulcers. There are a number of possibilities of the cause of the ulcers.  These include:

Foods eaten particularly acids in foods and drinks.
Dental disease such as tooth decay or gingivitis
Immunologic conditions such as Behcet's disease
Vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12 or iron deficiency
Hormonal conditions
Infection such as herpes simplex or other infections
Medications
Autoimmune conditions

The dentist can help with the dental causes. Your doctor can help with the systemic causes. There are also medications that can be helpful such as numbing agents to reduce pain, or medications that promote healing such as topical lidocaine. You can also try numbing the area with topical anesthetics such as Orajel.  You should avoid foods and drinks that irritate the mouth such as acidic foods.  Changing your toothpaste to a more soothing type of toothpaste such as a potassium nitrate toothpaste might also be helpful."
"The pain arises from the pressure of the cyst on the surrounding tissue. The shunt placement was to drain the fluid and relieve the pressure. If the cyst is enlarging and causing more symptoms, you should talk to your neurosurgeon about shunt valve blockage and the possibility of an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Your neurosurgeon will be able to tell you how often the shunt needs to be changed.","Arachnoid cysts can cause pain, particularly when they grow large and compress surrounding structures. Some data suggest that as many as 50% of patients with arachnoid cysts may require repeat surgery, although many cases are never symptomatic and only discovered incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons.   The need for repeat surgery is more common when cysts are large (> 2cm) and when they are located in specific areas, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and genu of the corpus callosum.

In general, however, shunts do need to be replaced periodically to prevent cyst growth and compression.","Pain is a common symptom in cases of arachnoid cysts. The frequency of shunt replacement or service depends on the type of shunt and the individual patient factors. In general, shunts need to be replaced or serviced every few years.","1. Arachnoid cysts in patients with shunt can cause pain.

"Unfortunately not.  Schwannomas, or acoustic neuromas, are benign tumors of Schwann cells that arise in the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve.  They are not metastatic, meaning they do not spread to other organs, but they are generally not operable due to their location.  Currently, the options for treatment are hearing preservation, or the attempt to leave as much of the functional nerve tissue behind as possible, and radiotherapy, the use of radiation to shrink the tumor.  The problem with radiotherapy is that it can cause many of the same problems that it does with malignant tumors such as headaches, nausea, and vomiting, and it can also cause hearing loss, facial nerve damage, and problems with balance and coordination.  In some cases, surgery is an option, but only when the tumor is small and has grown laterally along the internal auditory canal, which is a much less complicated surgery than removing a tumor that is embedded in the brainstem.  There is no chemotherapy for schwannomas, as they are not cancerous, and therefore do not grow uncontrollably.","While radiation has been used to treat benign schwannomas, there is limited experience in using radiation for malignant schwannomas. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for head and neck schwannomas. There is limited data on use of chemotherapy for schwannomas.","Unfortunately not.  While some tumors will shrink with radiation, large tumors, especially if they have been growing for a long time, are often not responsive to radiation or chemotherapy.  It is important to remember that tumors grow in a three-dimensional manner, so a very large tumor cannot be treated the same as a small tumor.  There are some promising new chemical treatments, but these are still in clinical trials.  If the tumor can be surgically removed, that is still the gold standard of treatment.","While there are case reports of decreased tumor size in patients with schwannomas treated with chemotherapy and radiation, no large randomized controlled trials have shown any such reduction in tumor size. In fact, there is a case report in the literature of a large schwannoma that increased in size following stereotactic radiosurgery. While this is only a single case report, it does highlight the fact that we do not yet know the ideal treatment for large, inoperable schwannomas. New treatments such as targeted radiation therapy and molecularly targeted chemotherapy are being studied in clinical trials, and your physician may have insight into any such studies in which you may be eligible to participate.","When there is a discussion about tumors and chemotherapy, we have to keep in mind that chemotherapy is a very broad term.  There are many different chemotherapeutic agents and each agent has many different formulations.  It is important to keep in mind that not all chemotherapeutic agents will be effective for all tumors.  There are some chemotherapeutic agents that are known to be effective for some schwannomas.  It is important to remember that not all schwannomas are the same.  There are many different types of schwannomas and some are more likely to respond to chemotherapy than others.  There are also many different formulations of chemotherapeutic agents and some formulations will be more effective for a particular tumor than other formulations.  It is important to remember that tumors can be resistant to chemotherapy.  Some tumors will not respond to chemotherapy no matter what type of chemotherapeutic agent is used or what formulation it is in.  It is also important to remember that more than one type of chemotherapeutic agent is commonly used at a time.  The effectiveness of chemotherapy can be dramatically increased when multiple chemotherapeutic agents are used at the same time.  The effectiveness of chemotherapy can be dramatically increased when radiation therapy is used in conjunction with chemotherapy.  The effectiveness of chemotherapy can be dramatically increased when surgery is used in conjunction with chemotherapy.  The effectiveness of chemotherapy can be dramatically increased when targeted therapy is used in conjunction with chemotherapy.  There are many different targeted therapies.  It is important to remember that not all targeted therapies will be effective for all tumors.  There are some targeted therapies that are known to be effective for some schwannomas.  It is important to remember that not all schwannomas are the same.  There are many different types of schwannomas and some are more likely to respond to targeted therapy than others.

High blood pressure and fibromyalgia are both very common.
High blood pressure is known as the second cause of end stage renal disease.
It is a major risk factor for heart attack, stroke, aneurysm, and other
things. It is characterized by a top number (systolic pressure) over
130, and diastolic pressure over 80 on a regular basis when not
exercising. It can also be characterized by the pulse pressure, which
is the difference between the top and bottom numbers, being over 80.
It is characterized by a tight feeling in your chest, headaches,
blurred vision, and other symptoms. It is treated with medication,
generally speaking.
Fibromyalgia is known as a chronic disorder characterized by widespread
pain and ""tender points"" in the body. It is mostly a woman's disease,
but can also affect men. It is known to cause ""fibro fog,"" which is
similar to a hangover, and other unpleasant symptoms. It is
generally uncurable. It is treated with a variety of medications,
generally speaking.

- Abnormalities in the nervous system
- Abnormalities in the immune system
- Abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system
- Changes in the nerves that transmit pain
- Changes in biochemistry
- Genetic factors
The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia include:
- Widespread muscle and joint pain
- Fatigue
- Sleep disturbances
- Headaches
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Numbness and tingling
- Memory and focus difficulties
- Increased sensitivity to noise, odors, bright lights, and other stimuli
- Morning stiffness
- Tenderness and pain in the same spots on the body
- Increased urinary frequency
- Allergies
- Numbness and tingling
- Palpitations
- Reduced ability to exercise
- Increased pain and fatigue following activity
- Joint swelling

The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is primarily clinical. Other diagnostic studies, such as imaging studies and laboratory tests, may support the diagnosis, but are not conclusive.

The mainstay of fibromyalgia treatment is a regular exercise program. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling, and swimming, can decrease pain and fatigue and improve mental well-being. Stretching exercises may help relieve muscle pain.

The following medications may be helpful for controlling symptoms of fibromyalgia:
- TCAs
- anticonvulsants
- antidepressants
- muscle relaxants
- Sleep medications
- anti-inflammatory medications

It is caused by dysfunction of neutrophils. The diagnosis of FMF is based on the patient's clinical presentation and gene mutation analysis. The treatment of FMF is mainly symptomatic.","Familial Mediterranean Fever, also known as periodic peritonitis or recurrent polyserositis, is a rare monogenic disease with systemic manifestation. It is a type of auto-inflammatory disease which is characterized by episodes of fever, abdominal pain and hemolytic anemia. It is a disease with systemic manifestation because it may involve virtually any organ or tissue in the body. The most frequent manifestations include fever, abdominal pain, fatigue and hemolytic anemia. The disease is often associated with inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, known as peritonitis. The disease can affect both children and adults, but usually begins in adulthood. The exact pathogenesis of familial Mediterranean fever is not fully understood. However, it is known that it is likely caused by dysfunction of neutrophils. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cells that play an important role in the immune response against bacterial and fungal infections. Familial Mediterranean fever is caused by mutations in neutrophils that make them overreact to non-infectious stimuli, causing recurrent episodes of inflammation. The prognosis is generally excellent. There is no cure for familial Mediterranean fever, but most patients have an excellent prognosis and the disease rarely causes death. Treatment for familial Mediterranean fever is mainly symptomatic and includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and colchicine.","1. Familial Mediterranean fever must be differentiated from other diseases causing fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthralgia, myalgia, rash and soft tissue swelling. These include infectious diseases such as Q fever, brucellosis, typhoid fever, malaria, tuberculosis, and non-infectious diseases such as sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.  2. The disease is usually suspected by the typical clinical presentation, however, the gold standard test for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever is the measurement of serum levels of fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clotting. A deficiency of fibrinogen in the blood is responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. The test is performed by taking a blood sample and measuring the level of fibrinogen in it using the immunonephelometric method.","1. What is Familial Mediterranean Fever?
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was first described by Dr. H. H. Cohen in 1927.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare monogenic disease with systemic manifestation. It is a disease with protean clinical manifestations.
The prevalence of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is estimated 100/100,000. FMF has no racial predilection and affects both genders. The majority of patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) are reported between the north and east of Turkey. The prevalence of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) in Turkey is reported as 100/100,000.
The cause of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) has not been clearly identified. The pathophysiology of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is not completely understood. Inheritance of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is autosomal recessive.
The most common symptoms of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, soft tissue swelling, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Familiar Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and family history. There are no diagnostic laboratory findings associated with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
There are no established measures for the primary prevention of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).
There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)."

This is a question about when a reliable treatment will emerge for a medical condition.

Context: You are a researcher who has made a groundbreaking discovery.

Answer:

I'm eager to know when we can expect a reliable treatment to emerge.

Unfortunately, burning mouth syndrome is a challenging condition to treat. Since we have recently discovered the underlying mechanism, we need to first develop drugs that can target the specific receptors involved. That could take a few years. After that, we need to conduct clinical trials to make sure the treatment is safe and effective. That could take another few years. So I'm afraid it could be a while before we have a reliable treatment. I'm sorry about that. I hope you can be patient a little longer.","1. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) most commonly affects women, especially after menopause.
2. The exact cause of BMS is unknown.
3. BMS is thought to be related to changes in the nerves that carry pain signals, rather than any underlying disease of the mouth.
4. The pain of BMS is constant and may be burning, pale, sharp, or tingling.
5. Treatments for BMS include capsaicin, vitamin B, and counseling to reduce stress.
6. There is no known cure for BMS.

2.  Researchers are working on a number of different avenues of approach.
3.  For example, one avenue is to try to identify the chemicals that are causing the burning sensations.
4.  Scientists at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recently identified two molecules -- sensory neuropeptide FF and neonatal insulin-like growth factor II -- that may play a role in causing burning mouth syndrome (BMS).
5.  These molecules activate nerves in the mouth that detect heat, pain and touch.
6.  Blocking these molecules might lead to new treatments for BMS.
7.  Another avenue of approach is to try to lessen the pain through the use of various medications, some of which are discussed in the article.
8.  Another avenue of approach is through the use of various supplements, such as B-vitamins, which might help to lessen the pain.
9.  Another avenue of approach is through the use of various herbal remedies, such as green tea.
10.  Another avenue of approach is through the use of various lifestyle changes, such as dietary changes and stress management.
11.  So there are a number of different avenues of approach, and researchers are working on a number of different avenues of approach.
12.  As to when a treatment will be available to alleviate our suffering, that is up to God.","The breakthrough was identifying the gene that codes for the calcium channel that is abnormally active in BMS. The gene is called CCKB. We are now testing compounds that block this channel to see if they relieve the burning sensation. So far the results are promising, but it will still be a while before a treatment is available. I wish I could say more, but I can't reveal the details until the study is published."
1) Iodine deficiency is the main cause of nodular goiter. So first we have to correct that. 2) If that does not help after 6 months to 1 year then only surgery is indicated. 3) You can visit any endocrinologist. They'll help you.,"1) Iodine - many people have deficiencies, especially if you live in an area where the diet is low in iodine, or if you are a vegetarian. It is important to speak with your doctor, as taking in too much iodine can be harmful.
2) Selenium - this mineral helps to protect the thyroid gland, and is also important for general health.
3) Avoid exposure to toxins - some chemicals and toxins can interfere with the normal functioning of the thyroid, so it is important to limit or avoid exposure to them.
4) Herbal remedies - there are some herbal remedies that may be helpful for supporting a healthy thyroid. It is important to speak with a doctor or herbalist to ensure that the remedies will not interact with any medications that you are taking.
5) Homeopathic remedies - these are another alternative to conventional medicine, and may be helpful for some people.
6) Acupuncture - this ancient Chinese practice is being used more and more in modern medicine, and may be able to help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with a nodular goiter.
7) Relaxation and stress management - stress can have a negative impact on the thyroid and on the overall functioning of your body. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, and meditation may be able to help you better manage the symptoms of a nodular goiter.
8) Support groups - connecting with others who have nodular goiters or thyroid disorders can be a great way to learn more about your condition, and to gain emotional support.
It is important to note that while these treatments may be helpful for some people, they are not a substitute for conventional medicine. If you have a nodular goiter, it is important to have it checked out by a medical professional.","1. Radioactive iodine treatment: This treatment option involves taking a single dose of radioactive iodine which is absorbed by the overactive thyroid cells and causes them to shrink. It may take several weeks or even months for the thyroid to shrink, but most patients experience a dramatic change in the size of the thyroid gland soon after treatment.2. Antithyroid medications: Antithyroid medications, such as propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole, can help suppress the production of thyroid hormone and slow down the growth of the thyroid gland. However, unlike radioactive iodine treatment, antithyroid medications do not aim to cure the condition, but rather to control its symptoms.3. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy: In this treatment option, patients with nodular goiter who have undergone a thyroidectomy are given thyroid hormone replacement therapy to replace the hormones normally produced by the thyroid gland. This therapy usually continues for the rest of the patient's life.","1) Radioactive iodine therapy: It is a common treatment option for toxic nodular goiter. In this procedure a radioactive capsule will be given to you, which you will have to swallow. The radioactive iodine accumulates in thyroid gland and destroys the excessive growth of thyroid tissue. It will be given in a single dose. Before this you will be given potassium iodide tablets for few weeks to increase the thyroid gland absorption of iodine.2) Anti-thyroid medications: It is also a treatment option for toxic nodular goiter. In this your doctor may prescribe you propylthiouracil (PTU) or Methimazole. These medicines will suppress the production of thyroid hormones and will eventually decrease the size of thyroid gland.3) Non-ionizing laser: It is a new technique used for the treatment of toxic nodular goiter. In this laser beam is used to target the thyroid gland tissue. The heat energy from the laser beam will destroy the excessive growth of thyroid tissue.4) Surgical intervention: It is a common and conventional method for the treatment of toxic nodular goiter. The doctor may recommend you to undergo thyroidectomy or lobectomy. In thyroidectomy the entire thyroid gland will be removed. In lobectomy only one lobe of the thyroid gland will be removed.","1. A nodular goiter is a swelling in the thyroid gland which is located at the front of the neck. It is more common in women than men, and usually appears between the ages of 35 and 40.
2. The best person to see about this condition is an endocrinologist, a doctor specializing in disorders of the thyroid gland and other endocrine glands.
3. One option is to have a fine needle biopsy to examine the cells within the nodule for any signs of cancer.
4. Another option is to have a radioactive iodine uptake test to see if the thyroid gland is absorbing too much iodine.
5. For mild cases, a doctor might prescribe medication to shrink the thyroid gland over a period of months.
6. In some cases, if the nodule is large enough, a doctor might recommend surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland.
7. The final option is to do nothing, and have regular checkups to make sure the nodule is not cancerous.","1) Iodine supply: The nodular goiter might be due to iodine deficiency. Iodized salt is the best and cheapest way to supply adequate iodine. Two tablespoon of iodized salt containing 15 mg of iodine is sufficient for a person per day. 2) Thyroid hormone supplement: In some cases of nodular goiter, the thyroid gland is capable of producing thyroid hormone, but it is not sufficient for the body needs. In such cases, thyroid hormone supplement can be prescribed. 3) Beta blockers: Beta blockers are recommended for the treatment of hyperthyroidism which is the overactivity of the thyroid gland. Beta blockers can also be used for the treatment of multinodular goiter with hyperthyroidism symptoms. 4) Antithyroid medications: Antithyroid medications such as propylthiouracil and methimazole can also be used for the treatment of nodular goiter. 5) Radioactive iodine therapy: In this treatment, a radioactive iodine is given to the patient which destroys the overactive thyroid cells and reduces the size of the nodules. 6) Surgery: Thyroidectomy is the surgical procedure which involves the removal of the thyroid gland in case of malignant nodular goiter."

"1) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) 
SLE is an autoimmune disease, which means your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The resulting inflammation can damage blood vessels, organs, and skin.
The underlying cause of this disease is not clear. Scientists believe that the problems with the immune system in SLE may be caused by a combination of genetics, environmental factors (such as infections or drugs), and hormones.
The most common signs and symptoms of SLE are:
Fatigue and weakness Joint pain and swelling Skin rashes (usually on the face, arms and hands) Fevers, night sweats Chest pain, pain in the arms, legs, and hands when exposed to the sun Anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems

2) Treatments for SLE include:

Anti-malarial medications such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Corticosteroids such as prednisone. Immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Antibody preparations such as cyclophosphamide and rituximab. 

3) Lupus Nephritis
Lupus nephritis is a serious complication of SLE. It is the leading cause of chronic kidney failure in young adults.
The kidneys are two of the body's most important organs. They remove waste from the blood and help regulate blood pressure. When the kidneys are damaged, they can't remove waste from the blood or make urine.
In lupus nephritis, the immune system attacks the kidneys. The resulting inflammation can cause kidney damage. The symptoms of lupus nephritis include:
Foamy appearance of urine Hypertension (high blood pressure) Edema (swelling) of any area of the body Weight gain Decreased urine output Blood in the urine

4) Treatments for lupus nephritis include:",1. Discontinue contributory medication 2. Glucocorticoids for severe disease 3.

These drugs can decrease fever, swelling and pain.

Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are often prescribed for patients with severe Lupus. These are immunosuppressant drugs that can decrease the activity of the immune system and alleviate symptoms.

For patients with skin lesions, phototherapy can be very helpful. This involves exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light, which can decrease skin lesions and the need for steroids.

For patients with kidney involvement, glucocorticoids or cyclophosphamide are often prescribed. These can decrease inflammation and prevent further damage to the kidneys.","1) Acetaminophen is used for pain

"50,000 IU per week is only 8,000 IU per day. There are reports of toxicity at 40,000 IU per day (for adults), so 8,000 IU per day is quite safe. However, the upper limit is debated, and some people may experience side effects at lower doses.
Flatulence and soft tissue swelling (because the fat-soluble Vitamin D accumulates in soft tissues) are potential side effects in overdose situations. There are reports of similar side effects in therapeutic doses in people with hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium), but the reports are not numerous, and many of the reports are not confirmed by other investigators.
People with low levels of vitamin D (<30 ng/mL) may benefit from higher doses. The upper limit for most people is around 3,000-4,000 IU per day, and the upper limit for adults is around 50,000 IU per week. However, some people may be able to tolerate higher doses.
The only way to know how much you respond to vitamin D is to monitor your levels. Most people respond to vitamin D by increasing their levels within 3-6 weeks. Once your levels reach the high-normal range (55 ng/mL), you can reduce the dose by 50% and still maintain your vitamin D level. This is called individualized dosing.
People with malabsorption syndromes, renal impairment, pregnancy, and breastfeeding may need higher doses. The upper limit for these groups is not known, and they are at greater risk of toxicity. To be on the safe side, they may want to consult with their physician before taking more than 50,000 IU per week.
Conclusion:

There are reports of toxicity at 40,000 IU per day (for adults), so 8,000 IU per day is quite safe.
However, the upper limit is debated, and some people may experience side effects at lower doses.
People with low levels of vitamin D (<30 ng/mL) may benefit from higher doses. The","50,000 IU of vitamin D a week is very high and could cause hypercalcemia, which could cause those side effects. It could also be the diet, and you may want to look at reducing methane producing foods such as beans, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and cabbage, and whole grains.","50,000 IU per week is only 8,000 IU per day, which is below the maximum daily tolerated dose of vitamin D (10,000-40,000 IU/day, depending on age and other factors).

There are few known side effects of vitamin D at moderate doses (up to 10,000 IU/day). One potential side effect of vitamin D is increased calcium levels, which can cause fatigue, nausea, constipation, and other symptoms. However, this side effect is usually only seen with excessive doses (particularly 50,000-100,000 IU/day) over a prolonged period of time.

There is no evidence of significant side effects from taking 8,000 IU/day of vitamin D (which works out to 50,000 IU/week). Therefore, aside from rare allergic reactions to vitamin D supplements, you can expect few side effects from this dose of vitamin D.","50,000 IU per week is an extremely high dose of vitamin D and is not safe for correcting low levels. This dose can cause hypercalcemia (elevated blood levels of calcium) which can lead to nausea, vomiting, constipation and other gastrointestinal symptoms which you described (flatulence, bloating, increased gas, indigestion). This dose should only be used under the guidance of a physician and in specific situations such as treating vitamin D deficiency-induced osteoporosis. It is not recommended for correcting low levels of vitamin D which can be done safely with regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and supplementation with 600-1,200 IU of vitamin D per day.","50,000 IU per week is a very high dose. The recommended dose is 600-1,000 IU per day for adults, so that's only 3,000-5,000 IU per week.
High doses of vitamin D can cause side effects such as increased risk of falls, calcuria (constipation), and flatulence.
Before taking such a high dose, it's important to have your blood levels of vitamin D checked and to discuss with your doctor the potential benefits and risks.","50,000 IU per week is not a high dose. Based on the end of 2016 recommendations, the maximum dose for adults is 4,000 IU per day, or 280,000 IU per month (NIH).
Flatulence is a potential side effect of vitamin D at any dose (RxList).
Safety is a matter of dose. Doses of vitamin D that correct deficiencies are safe (UpToDate), and have a very good safety profile (PubMed). 50,000 IU per week is below the level of toxicity (NIH)."

If you are having anxiety, chest tightness due to anxiety can be relieved by learning relaxation techniques, yoga and/or medications. If side effects of smoking patches are causing your chest tightness, then the chest tightness should resolve once you stop using the smoking patches. If your asthma is causing your chest tightness, then you should inhale bronchodilators (medications that dilate your airways) and/or take oral steroids (under supervision of a physician).

However, some triggers have been identified, such as:   

1.  Rigorous exercise
2.  Dehydration
3.  Air travel
4.  High altitudes
5.  Infections

It is essential to keep the patient well-hydrated and avoid rigorous exercises. If the patient has to travel, they should be advised to carry enough medications and keep themselves well-hydrated. In case the patient has an infection, treatment for the infection should be initiated as soon as possible.","Chemotherapy is a combination of different drugs, and depending on the type of lymphoma and the stage at which it is discovered, different combinations of drugs are administered at different time periods. One of the most common and severe side effects of chemotherapy is myelosuppression, which refers to a decrease in the production of blood cells by the bone marrow. 

This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, increased risk of infection, and bleeding or bruising easily. Another common side effect of chemotherapy is nausea and vomiting, which can result both from the chemicals themselves and from the lack of blood cells to help the stomach absorb food properly. 

Cramps can occur due to a variety of reasons- low blood counts can lead to muscle pain and weakness, and some chemotherapy drugs have gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, which can lead to muscle cramps from dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. If you are experiencing muscle cramps during chemotherapy, it is important to talk to your doctor to help determine the cause and find ways to alleviate your symptoms.","Chemotherapy Chat Doctor.

There are medicines to help with the nausea, and your doctor may adjust the dose of the chemotherapy medicine if the side effects are severe. With each cycle of chemotherapy the doses can be adjusted based on the level of side effects you experience, so as you go along the side effects should lessen.","There are a number of possible causes for cramps including

I've provided a brief answer based on the information you've provided. Please note that there are other aspects to this question, and if you would like a more thorough answer, please let me know.","1) Be involved in his care.  Many PSP patients have cognitive and behavioral changes that gradually interfere with their ability to make their own medical decisions.  So, early on, ask for a complete copy of his medical record and review it with your family and a trusted medical advisor.  
2) Find a Movement Disorder Specialist to be his primary physician.  While most neurologists will see PSP patients, Movement Disorder Specialists (MDS) are up to date on latest research and treatment strategies for PSP.  Most have extensive experience with PSP and can accurately diagnose and treat it.  You can find one near you at https://www.mdsabstracts.com/abstract/specialist/movement-disorders-specialist 
3) Get a copy of the diagnosis and treatment plan and keep it.  You'll want to review it from time to time, as the disease progresses.  If you have questions, ask the doctor.  If you have concerns, ask the doctor.  But don't wait for the doctor to raise concerns.
4) Keep a journal.  A paper journal, kept in a drawer, is best.  Include notes about his symptoms, how he responds to medication, what medications he takes, when he has doctor appointments, etc.  This will be a valuable reference for your family and his doctors.
5) Keep a list of all his medications and dosages.  Include over the counter medications and supplements.  Keep this list in your journal.  Ask his doctors if any of his medications should be adjusted and keep a list of those recommendations.
6) If he lives with you, hire help.  PSP progresses rapidly and you will not be able to care for him alone.  Ask his doctors for recommendations.  Check with his insurance.  A physical therapist, occupational therapist, and/or speech therapist may be needed.
7) If he lives apart from you, visit often and at different times of day.  PSP affects balance and can cause falls.  So observe his environment for hazards and report them to his doctors and caregivers.  Keep his living space safe for him and for others.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice. Please consult your doctor for individualized health information.","I take Ocella and have had no symptoms of DVT.  However, studies have shown that drospirenone, which is a synthetic hormone in Ocella, has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots.  This risk is generally thought to be higher than other birth control pills.  It's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of DVT (do a search and you'll find plenty of information on it) and to be proactive about preventing it (movement, hydration, etc.).  It is not common, in my experience, to see blood clots in women on birth control.  Hope this helps!","The symptoms that you have mentioned could be related to the birth control. Ocella (generically named drospirenone) is a type of birth control that contains a progestin, which is the active ingredient. Progestin can cause menstrual irregularities such as more/less frequent or more/less severe bleeding. It can also cause painful or blood-clot heavy bleeding. If these symptoms persist or worsen, you should contact your doctor.

"It depends on the type of epilepsy. 

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain cells is abnormal.  Epileptic seizures happen when the brain cells is excessively active, which causes unusual sensations, thoughts, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. 

Generally, If a person has not had a seizure for 10 years, the person is considered cured. 
However, researches show that about 80% of people with epilepsy will achieve seizure freedom with 10 years. 

So the answer depends on what you called cured. If you meant seizure free, then the answer is 10 years. 

If you want to know more about epilepsy, you can visit these websites: 
https://www.epilepsysociety.org 
https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/",2 years seizure free is required to be considered cured of seizure attacks.,"5 years without a seizure attack is a common criterion for defining a person as ""cured"" or ""in remission"". This is because most epileptic patients do not experience seizures every day, and it is difficult to determine whether a particular episode was a one-time occurrence or the beginning of a chronic condition. However, it is important to note that epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which may have genetic or developmental causes, and therefore can never truly be ""cured"". Instead, patients are considered to be in remission, and must continue to receive medical care and monitoring to ensure that the condition does not relapse.","5 years without a seizure is a good sign that someone may be cured of epilepsy. However, because epilepsy is a chronic condition, it is unlikely to be declared cured. Instead, the goal of treatment is to have no seizures for a long time, and to be able to decrease or stop medication. To determine if someone is cured, they would need to have a neurological evaluation, which would include a CT scan or MRI. However, even if these tests are normal, there is still a small chance that seizures could return. This is because the area of the brain where the seizure starts is not the same as the area where the symptoms occur. Therefore, it is possible for there to be no abnormalities on scans, but for the person to still have a seizure. Because of this, it is important for people with epilepsy to continue to take their medication, even after a long time without seizures.","5 years without seizures is definitely a good sign that the underlying cause of the seizures has been treated and the patient is in a ""cured"" state. However, epilepsy is a chronic disease which requires life-long monitoring and treatment to prevent recurrence. The goal of treatment is to minimize or eliminate seizures, while managing the side effects of medications. In about 7 out of 10 patients with epilepsy, the cause of their seizures can be determined. In the others, despite extensive testing, no cause can be found.",5 years without a seizure is generally considered a duration sufficient to consider a person cured of seizure attacks.

For example, for conditions with severe pain there are pain medications that can be administered under the guidance of a doctor.  There are also ways to address pain with non-pharmacological approaches, such as warmth, massage, and gentle movements.  For conditions with trouble sleeping there are techniques like relaxation therapy, white noise generators, and other strategies that can help improve sleep.  Again, it all depends on the type of condition and how to best address it.","1.
Accept the fear and sadness the family is feeling, instead of telling them to be strong or looking at them like they’re weak.

2.
Encourage the family member to make a list of what they value most in life, and prioritize their goals accordingly. This can help them decide whether or not they want to have the surgery at all.

3.
If they do choose to have the surgery, be there to support them before, during, and after the procedure. Offer to help in any way you can, whether it’s running errands, preparing meals, or just listening.

4.
Remember that grief is a process with no timeline, and that it’s okay to feel angry, scared, or sad. It’s also normal to want to avoid these emotions by distracting yourself or overworking, but it’s important to address them head-on in a healthy way.

5.
Reassure the family member that it’s okay to take a break from their usual responsibilities if they need to. Encourage them to rest and take care of themselves.

6.
Be there for the family member when they need you, and be patient as they process their emotions and make decisions. Allow them to ask questions and express their fears and concerns.

7.
Remember that everyone’s experience with grief and illness is different, and that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Some people find comfort in religion, prayer, or other forms of spirituality, while others might turn to science or logic for answers.

8.
Encourage the family member to reach out to a support group, therapist, or counselor if they need additional help processing their emotions. You can offer to go with them for added support if they’d feel more comfortable that way.

9.
Remember that it’s not your place to tell the family member what to do or how to feel. Your job is to listen, offer love and support, and help them find their own way through the grieving process.","50/50 survival rate is very low for any surgery. What is the name of the condition? 
For pain, you can give Tylenol 4 or 6 tablets three times a day. 
For the condition, depends on the diagnosis. If you let me know the diagnosis maybe I can help with that. 
But generally speaking, most of the diseases with poor survival rate can be treated with symptomatic treatment. The focus should be on the word ""poor"". As in, the disease is very aggressive and does not respond well to treatment. But that does not mean you give up and do nothing. You treat the symptoms and try to prolong the life of the patient.","1) I recommend physical therapy - it has been shown to improve symptoms in some patients.

2) Over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen can help, but you have to be careful because they can have side effects.

3) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has also been shown to be effective - it might help your loved one change their perception of the pain.

4) Acupuncture has also been shown to be effective in some cases.

5) And of course, your loved one should stop smoking if they smoke.

However, surgery is still the most effective treatment, despite the low success rate. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.","1.  Be there for them.  Pain is one of the most difficult things for a person to deal with, and having someone there for them, supporting them,  is the best thing you can do.
2.  There are a number of therapies for pain - I recommend looking into therapeutic touch, which has been studied and shown to reduce pain levels.  It's a simple technique that anyone can learn, and takes only a little practice.  It's a form of energy work that feels wonderful to the recipient, and is very helpful.
3.  Relaxation techniques can also help with pain - I highly recommend the free iPhone app ""Progressive Muscle Relaxation"" by PocketCents - it's a great app that walks you through progressive muscle relaxation, which is a technique that can reduce pain levels as well as stress.  It's a great app that I use regularly.
4.  Look into other alternative therapies in your area, and encourage your family member to try them.  Acupuncture, for instance, can be very helpful for pain, as can massage.  See what's available in your area, and help your family member explore their options.
5.  Keep in mind that pain is a very difficult thing to deal with, and do what you can to keep your family member's spirits up.  It's a difficult road, and they're going to need your support."
"Radiation therapy can be an option for melanoma of the heel. The goal of radiation therapy is to kill the cancer cells and shrink the tumor, and it is often used in combination with other treatments, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy. 

As with any cancer treatment, there are potential side effects to consider. Radiation therapy can cause inflammation, burning, redness, swelling, and other reactions in the treated area. In some cases, it can also cause scarring or disfigurement. Your doctor will work with you to manage these side effects. 

The decision to use radiation therapy will depend on several factors, including the stage and location of the melanoma, your overall health, and other medical conditions. Your doctor will help determine whether radiation therapy is a good treatment option for you.","As the previous answer stated, radiation therapy is a local therapy used to treat cutaneous melanoma that has spread to the regional lymph nodes. Radiation therapy has been shown to improve progression-free and overall survival in patients with melanoma.  

However, radiation therapy can also have adverse effects. It can cause mucositis, erythema, desquamation, edema, and ulceration at the site being treated. This can cause discomfort and impair the patient’s quality of life.

It is important to weigh the benefits and risks of radiation therapy when deciding on a treatment plan. Depending on the extent of the melanoma and the patient’s overall health, one or more of the above treatments may be used in combination to achieve the best possible outcome.","Radiation therapy is a localized treatment, and as the disease has progressed from the heel to the leg, it is unlikely to be helpful.  Radiation therapy works by killing cancer cells in the area being treated, but it cannot stop the spread of cancer cells through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.  Radiation therapy may help slow the growth or reduce the size of a tumor, but it cannot cure the disease once it has spread beyond the initial location.  It is important to talk with your doctor about all of the treatment options that may be appropriate for your specific situation.","As with most cancers, early detection is key and can lead to very successful treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, melanoma that has spread is a much more serious condition and is associated with a poor prognosis, especially if it has spread to the liver (Liu et al., 2016). Radiation therapy can help to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with metastatic melanoma, such as pain and discomfort, but it is not usually curative (Bayliss, 2009). Clinical trials of targeted therapies and immunotherapy are ongoing, and some show promising results, particularly in combination with other treatments (Hammers HJ et al., 2018). The success of these treatments is limited by the individual patient's response to treatment, and factors such as the presence and extent of disease, age, and overall health status. It is important for patients with melanoma to discuss all treatment options with their doctors and to participate in clinical trials when possible.","1. Radiation therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for melanoma of the heel.
 2. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the form of radiation therapy most often used to treat melanoma of the heel.
 3. A clinical trial showed that EBRT plus interferon alfa-2a produced better results than EBRT plus placebo.
 4. Radiation therapy can be used to treat melanoma of the heel, but other treatments, such as biological therapy, are also being studied and used.","1. Radiation therapy (RT) has a limited role in the treatment of patients with melanoma that has migrated from the heel up the leg. 

2. RT can be used to treat the cutaneous, subcutaneous, and bony lesions. 

3. However, lesions in bone are often inoperable, and local RT dose to the bone lesions can be quite high (> 8 Gy) with acceptable rates of side effects. 

4. Therefore, systemic therapy with novel drugs or immunotherapy may be more desirable and effective in treating the systemic disease."
"1. The sugar alcohols you mentioned are used as sweeteners in chewing gums.  Xylitol, a natural sweetener, is also used in gums and mints to prevent dental caries or tooth decay.  Xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol are also used in cough syrups to help with the sweet taste of the syrup.
2. I would suggest you to use gums which do not contain any of the above sweeteners. You can also use gums which contain natural gum base such as xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum etc.
3. You can also ask your physician whether you can use an artificial saliva.
4. Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates can also cause muscle damage in addition to causing dry mouth. If that is the case, your physician may consider switching your medication.
5. Smoking and alcohol consumption may further aggravate the dry mouth. So you may want to restrict their use.
6. Home care methods that may help:

a. Increase your fluid intake, especially water.

b. Chew sugar-free gum.

c. Avoid foods that are high in caffeine, such as tea, coffee, green tea and many soft drinks.

d. Use a mouth moisturizer, such as a gel or mouth spray, to help with your dry mouth.
e. Try yogurt, kefir or milk; these may help to stimulate saliva flow.

7. If you have any signs of infection - swelling, pain or fever - in the area from where the saliva glands empty saliva into the mouth, see your physician immediately.","XTILTM

XTILTM (pronounced “xtile”) is a revolutionary new oral care brand that provides a long-lasting solution for dry mouth. XTILTM toothpaste and mouth spray are the first products of their kind to effectively and safely relieve dry mouth by targeting the underlying cause.

Unlike other dry mouth remedies that only provide temporary relief by coating the mouth, XTILTM products work to restore the body’s ability to produce saliva, the naturally occurring substance that helps to wash away bacteria, neutralize acid, and keep the mouth hydrated and healthy. XTILTM products are free of alcohol, parabens, and artificial colors and flavors, and are safe for daily use.

XTILTM toothpaste and mouth spray are available in the United States at Walgreens and Duane Reade locations nationwide, and online at xtipltm.com.","Cholesterol is necessary for the construction of cell membranes, and is especially important in the development of myelin sheath.  The myelin sheath is the fatty covering surrounding the nerves which allows for efficient transmission of nerve impulses.  Without adequate cholesterol, the myelin sheath cannot be properly constructed, and nerve impulse transmission is impaired.

As far as supplementation, it is best to get your doctor to check your blood cholesterol levels, and to determine if your cholesterol is low, or if your other blood lipids are out of balance.  Then, if it is determined that you need to increase your cholesterol levels, it may be accomplished by supplementing with cholesterol enriched foods like eggs, liver, and butterfat contents of meat.  If dietary modification is insufficient, supplements may be prescribed.

It is important to note that cholesterol supplementation is a serious matter, and should only be done under the guidance of a doctor.  Cholesterol is a necessary component of many processes in the body, but too much cholesterol can cause problems as well, including the formation of atherosclerotic plaques which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.",Try using a spray with the active ingredient Cetylpyridinium.  It comes in different brand names but is the active ingredient.  It is also available in a mouth wash.  Hope I could help.,"There are many prescription medications that can cause a dry
  mouth, here are some examples:
  -Decongestants
  -Diuretics
  -Antihistamines
  -Depression medications
  -Medications used for

  recommend using products with xylitol, which has been shown to
  help with dental health.

As a preface, I am not a doctor, and the information I provide is not meant to be used to treat or diagnose any condition. Please consult your doctor for personalized medical advice.","Answer: There are many medications that can cause dry mouth as a side effect.  If you are experiencing dry mouth as a result of medication, talk to your doctor about your options.

It's important to note that sugar alcohols such as maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol are not the same as sugar.  Sugar alcohols are used as sugar substitutes and are commonly found in chewing gum, mints, and other sugar-free products.  If you have an intolerance to sugar alcohols, then products containing these ingredients will not be a good option for you.

One option that may provide more lasting relief is to use an oral moisturizer throughout the day. Look for products containing ingredients such as aloe vera, xylitol (a sugar alcohol that you may tolerate), and sorbitol (another sugar alcohol that may be more gentle on your system).  Using a mouthwash with ingredients such as sage and myrrh may also provide relief by coating and soothing the mouth and reducing dryness.

It's important to note that the underlying cause of your dry mouth should be identified and treated as necessary.  If your dry mouth is caused by dehydration, then increasing your fluid intake may provide relief. If your dry mouth is caused by a medication that you are taking, then talking to your doctor about changing your medication may be necessary.  If your dry mouth is caused by a medical condition such as Sjögren's syndrome, then treatment of the underlying condition will be necessary to provide lasting relief."
"2009 was a long time ago! Since then, there have been some developments in the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia.
There is no cure yet, but there is a medication approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. It is called idebenone, and you can read about it here: https://rarediseases.org/for-patients-and-families/information-resources/drug-index/idebenone.
I'm sorry, but I don't know when it will be available in your country. You should ask your doctor(s) about that. They will know more than I do about availability in your region.","Point of Caution: As a doctor, I would like to point out that it is unadvisable to consume anything containing Nicotine, as it can be harmful. Please do not consume Nicotine in any form.
Response:I am glad to hear about the DNA report of the affected individuals. It is unfortunate that they are affected by Friedreich's Ataxia. As a doctor, I can tell you that there is no cure to Friedreich's Ataxia. However, there are treatments available to help alleviate some of the symptoms. These include:

Medication for Heart Problems: As individuals with Friedreich's Ataxia are at a higher risk of developing heart problems, it is important that medication to regulate the heart is taken.

Physiotherapy: This can help improve balance and coordination, which can reduce the frequency and severity of falls.

Medication for Muscle Weakness: Muscle weakness is a common symptom of Friedreich's Ataxia, and medication can help alleviate this.

Vitamin Supplements: Individuals with Friedreich's Ataxia often have Vitamin deficiencies, so it is important to consume a balanced diet and take Vitamin supplements.

It is important to note that while these treatments can help, they do not cure the condition. Furthermore, it is important to consult a doctor before starting any treatment to ensure that it is safe for the individual.","1. This treatment is in very early stages, still in animal model testing. There is no estimate for market availability yet.  2. You and your family members have a genetic condition, and while there are treatments that can help some of the symptoms, there is currently no cure for the condition.","Friedreich ataxia is a debilitating disease for which there is no effective treatment. Several approaches are being studied, but none have been shown to be effective yet. The DNA report that you sent did not attach. Please post a reply with the specific mutation that affects you and your family members. There have been some promising animal studies using gene therapy techniques to correct the mutation, but these have not yet been applied to human patients. There are also studies looking at the use of anti oxidants to reduce the damage caused by the mutation, but these have also not yet been shown to be effective in human patients. I am sorry that I cannot offer more hopeful news at this time.","point of view. Several trials have been conducted to stem the effects of Friedreich ataxia, but with little success. Clinical trials are underway for a medication called idebenone which has shown some promise in early trials. The trials are still in the early stages and it is unknown when, or even if, this medication will make it to market. Another medication called miglustat has been approved for market in Europe, but it is unknown when it will be approved for sale in the United States. Several other medications are still in the research and development stage and may be years away from being tested in humans. 

It is important to remember that clinical trials are designed to test the safety and efficacy of a medication in a population with a disease. They are always conducted with a placebo control group. Many patients with Friedreich ataxia have enrolled in clinical trials only to be disappointed when the medication being tested was not effective. It is unknown at this time if idebenone or any other medication will be effective in treating the effects of Friedreich ataxia. 

The best advice at this time is to take care of yourself and your family members by making sure they get the proper nutrition and vitamins, stay hydrated, avoid smoking and drinking alcohol, and get regular exercise. Work with your doctor to manage the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia and discuss any new medications or treatments that become available.",": You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.

Question: I am seeking assistance as a patient with Friedreich's ataxia, and I've learned that a treatment may be in development. With two family members, aged 22 and 24, also suffering from this condition, could you please provide guidance on the current status of this treatment and when it might become available in the market, as indicated by my attached DNA report?

Answer:"
"1.2 mm to 2.3 mm is a very small stone and in this size, the chances of spontaneous passage of stone is high. So, nothing to worry much. Just ask him to Chat Doctor.  However, if he has severe pain then go for ultrasound and find out the status of the stone. If it has passed, then well and good. If it is stuck then you can proceed with the medical management or endoscopic (ureteroscopy) removal of the stone.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is a small kidney stone. I recommend that the patient take 2 liters of water on the first day the stone is discovered, and then 3 liters of water each day after that. The patient should get an ultrasound to check the stone's progression. If the stone grows larger than 3cm, the patient should consult with a urologist. This is the best course of action for a patient with a small kidney stone.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is approximately the size of a grain of sand. This small of a stone is unlikely to cause symptoms and may not require treatment. If the patient is asymptomatic, observation and monitoring for stone growth may be appropriate.

However, if the patient is experiencing pain or other symptoms, analgesics and hydration may be recommended. Analgesics can help manage pain, while hydration can help flush out the stone and reduce symptoms. In some cases, alpha blockers may be prescribed to help relax the muscles in the ureter and make passing the stone easier.

If the stone is not passable, surgical intervention may be necessary. Options may include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or open surgery. The decision to proceed with one of these options would depend on various factors, such as the patient's medical history, the size and location of the stone, and the presence of other medical conditions.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is approximately the size of a grain of sand. Therefore, I recommend nothing and suggest the patient wait and let nature take its course. The stone will either pass on its own or require minimal intervention such as pain management and hydration.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is too small a stone to be of any concern.  Most small stones will pass on their own.

To help pass the stone, encourage fluids, especially water.  The NIH says, ""When the stone is small enough, doctors may suggest waiting to see if the stone will pass on its own.""

If the patient experiences pain, have them take over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen.  Avoid NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen as they may harm the kidneys.

If the stone doesn't pass and the patient experiences symptoms, have them undergo lithotripsy, a non-invasive procedure that uses shockwaves to break up the stone into smaller pieces that can pass more easily.

If the stone is too large or is causing too much pain, have the patient undergo ureteroscopy, a minimally invasive procedure that uses a small camera to remove the stone.

If the patient has recurring small stones, have them take preventative measures like reducing salt intake and drinking water.  Some patients may need to take medication to reduce stone formation.","1.2mm x 2.3mm is just slightly over the threshold for a stone to pass on its own, so no treatment is needed at this time. However, the patient should be advised to drink plenty of fluids and follow the dietary guidelines for reducing stone formation. If the stone does not pass within a reasonable time period (e.g. 6 months to a year), then therapeutic options for stone removal such as lithotripsy or surgery should be discussed. It's important to note that not all stones require removal, especially if the patient is asymptomatic and the stone is small. However, the patient should be monitored regularly to ensure the stone does not grow in size or cause complications."

"Pacemaker is not indicated in patients with hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating. Sweating is normal human reaction to the environmental changes and stress. However, if sweating is excessive and has social or occupational consequences, it is called as hyperhidrosis. 
Hyperhidrosis may be classified according to the affected areas into focal, general, and secondary hyperhidrosis. 
Compression devices and surgical procedures were used in the past for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Nowadays, non-invasive methods are preferred. 
Botulinum toxin injections, iontophoresis (using magnets), and laser surgery are some of the non-invasive methods used for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. 
Pacemaker is not indicated in any form of hyperhidrosis. Therefore, it will not help in preventing the sweating.

It is a common complication of various forms of motor disabilities (including cerebral palsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, etc).  It can be reduced by using a pacemaker to help regulate the contractions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.","While pacemakers can help control some types of abnormal heart rhythms, they are not effective in controlling muscle spasms. It is worth noting, however, that pacemakers can help to prevent some types of muscle spasms by helping to control the rhythm of the heart and preventing situations that can lead to muscle spasms. In some cases, a pacemaker can also help to control the symptoms of muscle spasms by helping to regulate blood pressure and preventing some types of arrhythmias that can exacerbate muscle spasms. It is always important to discuss the potential benefits of a pacemaker with a doctor in order to determine if it is the right choice for an individual patient.","As per the information provided, a pacemaker would not be able to prevent the spasms.","Yes, modern pacemakers are capable of detecting and preventing ventricular tachycardia.","Pacemaker is a treatment option for preventing spasms after a hemi-section of the spinal cord.

After several years of weekly injections, the person may be able to tolerate the substance without reaction. This treatment may work for food allergies, including milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat allergies.

However,

It can be dangerous, and reactions can range from mild to severe.

Make sure she consults her doctor before starting on this treatment.","There is no cure for any allergy. The best option for her is to avoid all dairy products. This may seem like a difficult task, but with the prevalence of soy, almond, and coconut based alternatives, it's becoming much easier. Just be sure to read labels, as many ""dairy-free"" alternatives do still contain milk in them.

If you have any questions about specific foods, please let me know. I also highly recommend speaking with an allergist to do a food challenge to determine just how severe the allergy is.","I am sorry to hear about your wife's condition. There is definitely hope for a full recovery with the correct treatment plan. It is important to know the type of milk proteins that she is allergic to. A blood test for specific IgE (immunoglobulin E) levels for milk can be performed. This blood test will identify the exact milk proteins that your wife is allergic to. The only way to completely avoid exposure to the offending milk proteins is to strictly avoid all dairy products. However, this may not be necessary if the milk proteins that your wife is allergic to are not present in other food products. Your wife's allergist can help with the interpretation of the blood test results and provide guidance on how to safely introduce other foods that do not contain the offending milk proteins.

No, there is no cure for ocular albinism and no medication can treat the condition. Ocular albinism is a genetic disorder that affects the eyes and is characterized by poor visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, and decreased visual response. The condition is caused by decreased tyrosinase activity or defective tyrosine transport, which results in a buildup of tyrosine in the eyes, leading to visual impairment. While treatment for ocular albinism is aimed at managing symptoms and improving vision, there is no cure for the condition.

"1) If you do not remember having chickenpox, then it is possible to get a blood test to check for antibodies against the virus.

2) The vaccine that you should get, if any, depends on your age, your medical history, your vaccination history, and other factors. An example of a vaccine that you might get is the varicella vaccine. However, you should talk to your doctor to determine if you need this vaccine and which vaccines you need specifically.","If you are not sure whether you had chickenpox in the past or not, a blood test can be done to find out if you have antibodies against the virus. If you do, it means that you are immune to the disease. Without these antibodies, you are not immune and can benefit from being vaccinated against chickenpox.

As for the best vaccine option, it depends on your age and vaccination history:

If you are an adult, the best option is to get the varicella vaccine.
If you are a child older than 12 months or a teenager, the best option is to get the varicella vaccine or the Zostavax vaccine.
If you are younger than 12 months or have not been vaccinated against chickenpox before, the best option is to get the varicella vaccine.

Please note that these vaccines are recommended for people who have not had chickenpox before or who do not have antibodies against the virus. If you have already had chickenpox or have these antibodies, the vaccines are not recommended for you.","Answer:  No, there is no blood test to determine if someone has had chickenpox.  The chickenpox vaccine may be suitable for you if you have not had chickenpox.  The chickenpox vaccine is not suitable for anyone who has already had chickenpox.  If you are unsure whether you have had chickenpox, it is recommended that you do not receive the chickenpox vaccine.","1. The presence of antibodies in the blood can indicate past infection, but a negative test does not necessarily mean a person has not been infected.
2. The recommended vaccine for someone who has not had chickenpox is Varivax.","1. Varicella (chickenpox) is a vaccine-preventable disease.
2. If you are unsure whether you had chickenpox as a child, a blood test can confirm it.
3. Blood test for Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies can be done to see if you are immune to the disease.
4. Two vaccines against chickenpox are available:
    a. Live, attenuated vaccine
    b. Live, intradermal vaccine
5. The live, attenuated vaccine is recommended for children 12 months to 12 years of age who have not previously been vaccinated or have not had a case of chickenpox.
6. The live, intradermal vaccine is recommended for children 13 years and older, and for adults who have not had a case of chickenpox or been vaccinated before.
7. Possible side effects of the chickenpox vaccine include:
    a. Mild fever
    b. Mild rash
    c. Swelling of the arm where the shot was given
10. The chickenpox vaccine does not protect against shingles (herpes zoster), but shingles risk is reduced.

If you don't have antibodies, you are considered unimmunized and the chickenpox vaccine is recommended for you. The chickenpox vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine that provides protection against the virus. It is typically given to children between the ages of 12-15 months and 4-6 years, but can be given to adults as well. Adults who are immunized will still develop a mild case of chickenpox, but will be less contagious and are less likely to develop complications from the disease.

"1. Iron deficiency anemia after gastric bypass usually is due to inadequate dietary intake (usually caused by malabsorption) or side effects of medications (proton pump inhibitors). B12 deficiency does not cause this type of anemia.
2. Iron deficiency anemia that occurs despite oral iron supplementation and reticulocytosis is sometimes caused by chronic transfusions (which you received) that increase the iron stores in your body. These stores can last for 5-10 years after the last transfusion, so you don't need as much iron absorption as before.
3. B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia (anemia with large red blood cells) that can coexist with other types of anemia. In your case, however, it is unlikely to be the cause of your anemia.","1) Your intake of Vitamin B12 should be checked. It is required for proper absorption of iron. A deficiency of B12 can definitely cause a problem with absorption of iron. The diet after surgery would definitely be low in B12, I suppose. So supplements or dietary sources of B12 should be added.2) If the stomach has been bypassed, then intrinsic factor producing cells in the stomach would have been lost. In such cases, Vitamin B12 supplements would need to be in the form of Methylcobalamin (preferably) or Cyanocobalamin. These are the forms of Vitamin B12 that are known to be absorbed, even without intrinsic factor.3) Intrinsic factor producing cells may regenerate over time. So, if this problem persists, the condition may need to be discussed with a specialist.","Hello, Thank you for your question. I can understand your concern. Iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency do have common symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin etc. But these two conditions are caused by different mechanisms. Iron deficiency anemia occurs due to low iron stores in the body, whereas vitamin B12 deficiency occurs due to low vitamin B12 stores in the body. Both the conditions can co-exist in patients who are on very low diet or having mal-absorption problems. However, iron deficiency anemia can be treated with iron supplements and dietary changes, and vitamin B12 deficiency can be treated with vitamin B12 supplements and dietary changes. I hope this answers your question. I wish you good health. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I would be happy to answer any further questions you may have.","1) Gastric Bypass surgery usually does not cause B12 deficiency 2) The main cause of B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia and this is caused due to lack of intrinsic factor which is needed for absorption of B12 in the ileum. Gastric bypass patients do not have this problem since they have normal amount of intrinsic factor. 3) The diet after GBP surgery is not restricted, it's just that the stomach can only hold small quantities of food. So the patients can eat as much as they want, but in small quantities. This will not cause B12 deficiency. 4) Please mention if you are taking any medication which can cause B12 deficiency e.g. Colchicine, Proton pump inhibitors (PPI), Anti-Tuberculous drugs, Metformin.","[I]n many causes of anemia of chronic disease, the underlying hematopoietic abnormality is an increased rate of red cell destruction... [I]n these conditions the bone marrow is unable to keep up with the rate of red cell destruction, resulting in anemia. Causes of anemia of chronic disease that are associated with increased red cell destruction include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, alcoholism, and infections (such as malaria). Certain medications (such as penicillin) and toxins (such as ethylene glycol, the main ingredient in antifreeze) can also result in anemia of chronic disease by directly increasing red cell destruction. Anemia of chronic disease should be differentiated from other causes of anemia, such as iron deficiency anemia, chronic kidney disease, and anemia of chronic inflammation.


The above passage is excerpted  from the website http://www.healthline.com/health/anemia-chronic-disease#Outlook1, which also states that ""anemia of chronic disease usually responds to treatment of the underlying chronic disease.""
I'm not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so I thought I'd weigh in with my two cents. The passages I cited from the website do not mention B12 deficiency or iron absorption. It seems that your iron deficiency is more likely due to the malabsorption that results from the surgery, rather than a B12 deficiency or inadequate diet. Your blood work may reveal the cause of your anemia. Please see a doctor, and be well!","1. Could your struggles with iron absorption and dietary restrictions be contributing to a B12 deficiency?

Answer: Yes, there is a possibility that your struggles with iron absorption and dietary restrictions could be contributing to a B12 deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is usually caused by iron deficiency, and not related to B12 levels. However, after gastric bypass surgery, there is a possibility that you may have malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and B12. If you are experiencing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your dietary habits, it is possible that you may not be absorbing nutrients properly, including B12, which can lead to a deficiency over time. It is important to discuss your concerns with your doctor to determine if you require vitamin B12 supplementation.

2. Is this type of anemia related to B12 levels?

Answer: No, this type of anemia is not related to B12 levels. As mentioned above, iron deficiency anemia is usually caused by iron deficiency, and not related to B12 levels. However, it is important to have your B12 levels checked to rule out any other potential causes of anemia."

High ammonia levels may cause shortness of breath but it has to be confirmed by blood levels of ammonia.
It is a strong toxic substance and is very harmful to body.

Ammonia is colorless, odorless gas at room temperature. It forms when proteins are digested by bacteria in the intestines. Ammonia is also made in the body when amino acids break down. Most of the ammonia in the body is removed by the kidneys and excreted in the urine 1.

http://www.cdc.gov/copd/index.htm","Yes, cirrhosis and elevated ammonia levels (hyper-ammonemia) definitely can contribute to shortness of breath. Ammonia is a waste product that is normally excreted by the kidneys. In cirrhosis, the kidneys are often not working well, leading to accumulation of ammonia in the blood. This can lead to altered mental status, fatigue, and shortness of breath, among other symptoms. Elevated ammonia levels are one of the ""7 B's"" used to remember symptoms of cirrhosis. The other 6 B's are: bilirubin, B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, fatigue, fluid retention, and failure of synthetic function (ability to make proteins).

Ammonia is a toxic substance that is produced by the breakdown of protein in the body, and it is normally converted into urea by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. However, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, the liver may not be able to process ammonia effectively, leading to an accumulation of this substance in the bloodstream. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including breathing difficulties, as well as changes in mental status, confusion, and seizures. Treatment for high ammonia levels may include medications to lower ammonia levels, as well as dietary changes and other supportive measures. It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of high ammonia levels, or if you have concerns about your liver function.","1. Shortness of breath with no pain is unlikely related to the cirrhosis itself.  Common symptoms of liver failure include abdominal pain, edema, easy bruising/nosebleeds, and fatigue.  2. High ammonia levels can cause a variety of symptoms including confusion, fatigue, and muscle weakness.  However, shortness of breath is not typically one of the symptoms of high ammonia levels.  There are other causes of shortness of breath that also need to be evaluated such as an infection or pulmonary problem. I recommend consulting with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They can also help with dietary changes that can help lower ammonia levels.","Yes, high ammonia levels can definitely affect respiratory function and contribute to breathing difficulties. Ammonia is a toxic substance that is produced when proteins are broken down in the body. In healthy individuals, ammonia is converted into urea in the liver and then excreted from the body in the urine. However, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, the liver may not be able to process ammonia effectively, leading to high levels of this toxic substance in the blood (hyper-ammonemia). This can cause a range of symptoms, including confusion, fatigue, and shortness of breath. In particular, high ammonia levels can affect the respiratory center in the brain, leading to respiratory dysfunction and breathing difficulties.

"1. The most common treatment for pubic lice is permethrin 1%, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
    A cream or lotion form of permethrin 1% is used. It is left on the skin for a certain amount of time, then washed off.
    Permethrin 1% is sometimes used as a treatment for scabies, too.

2. Malathion 0.5% is sometimes used to treat pubic lice. It is usually applied to the skin in the affected area and left on for a certain amount of time before being washed off.

3. In some cases, prescription medicines may be used to treat pubic lice. These medicines may be given by a health care provider.

4. Sometimes, pubic lice can't be easily treated by the methods listed above. In these cases, a skin cream called crotamiton 10% can be used. This medicine is usually applied to the skin in the affected area twice a day for 10 days.

5. When pubic lice do not respond to permethrin 1%, malathion 0.5%, prescription medicines, or crotamiton 10%, it is usually because the lice have developed resistance to these medicines. In these cases, other medicines may be prescribed. These include:

- Lindane, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
- Crotamiton 10% in a lotion form, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
- Benzyl benzoate, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
- Sulfur, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
- Quarantine, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.
- Gasoline, which is applied to the skin in the affected area. (This is not advised.)
- Boric acid, which is applied to the skin in the affected area.

These medicines are usually applied to the skin in the affected area once or twice a day for a certain amount of time, then washed off.

6. When pubic lice have spread to the hair, a special shampoo or conditioner that contains permethrin 1% may be used","1. Topical permethrin
2. Topical lindane
3. Oral ivermectin","1) Lather the pubic hair and the surrounding skin with plenty of soap and water. Pubic lice can be easily washed off with soap and water.
2) Use a cream or lotion that contains either permethrin or pyrethrum as a follow-up to the soap and water. These products are available without a prescription. They are put on the pubic hair and skin, left on for a certain amount of time, and then washed off. Some of these products are available as a spray. They are pumped on the pubic hair and skin, left on for a certain amount of time, and then rinsed off.
3) Treat clothing and bedding to kill lice and eggs. Lice can live for only a few days off the body. But eggs can survive for about a week, and they are easy to miss. To kill lice and eggs that may be on clothing, bedding, and other items, those items should be washed using hot water, then tumbled dried using high heat. This will usually kill lice and eggs. Dry-cleaning or steam-cleaning clothing and bedding will also kill lice and eggs.
4) Check again in 7 days to be sure that the lice and eggs are completely gone. Lice may have developed resistance to certain pesticides. If one type of pesticide doesn't seem to work, try another one. The most common pesticides that are used to treat pubic lice include permethrin and pyrethrum. If treatment doesn't work, it's possible that the lice may be resistant to the type of pesticide used. In that case, a different type of pesticide can be tried.
5) Get tested for STDs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, as well as for other infections. Your sexual partners should also be tested and treated if found to be infected. This can help prevent the disease from coming back.","1.Most effective ways to treat pubic lice are

Unfortunately, there are no over-the-counter treatments available for pubic lice. Pubic lice, also known as ""crabs,"" are a type of louse that infest the pubic hair of humans. Treatment typically involves the use of strong insecticides, such as permethrin or malathion, which are applied topically to the affected area. These medications are only available with a doctor's prescription, as strong chemicals can cause serious side effects if used improperly. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully when using these medications, and to avoid using them for longer than recommended, as this can lead to resistance and treatment failure.","1. Pubic lice are eliminated with nitrogen dioxide.
 2. Lice are very sensitive to heat, so they can be easily eliminated with a hot shower and comb.

"The duration of morphine withdrawal will vary from person to person, and cannot be estimated precisely. However, the symptoms of withdrawal usually start within 12 hours of last morphine dose, and may last up to a week. The symptoms include: restlessness, yawning, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection (""goose bumps""), and fever. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.","The length of the flu-like symptoms in a patient coming off of long-term morphine will vary based on a number of factors including the dose and duration of morphine use, the age and general health of the patient, and the presence of any other medical conditions. A physician should evaluate the patient to determine the likely cause of the symptoms (e.g. morphine withdrawal vs. influenza) and to monitor the patient for any complications. 

As a general rule, the symptoms of morphine withdrawal usually start within 12 hours of the last dose and last for about a week, although in some cases they may persist for longer than a week. Influenza typically lasts for a week or two, although again the duration may vary depending on the patient's condition and other factors. It is also possible for a patient coming off of morphine to have overlapping or superimposed infections such as influenza, which can further complicate the diagnosis and treatment of these symptoms.","10 years at 365 days per year is 36500 days. Using morphine for 10 years can result in a morphine level of around 10-20ng/mL which can cause little to no debilitation. 

However, it is highly unlikely that someone would take morphine for 10 years straight, with no breaks, at 365 days per year. Most people need a break from opiates every once in a while, whether it be due to financial problems, lack of access, or simply because they want to try something else.

Even if someone did take morphine for 10 years straight, the debilitation would not be permanent. It is possible to recover from opiate use after only a few weeks of not using opiates. Opiate withdrawal can last for around 10 days, with symptoms peaking on days 3-4. After this time period, the majority of symptoms subside.

So to recap: It's highly unlikely that someone would use morphine for 10 years straight, and if they did, the debilitation would not be permanent.","The half life of morphine is around 2 hours. So if it was administered recently it might still be in the system in detectable amounts, but the flu like symptoms you describe are not typically associated with morphine.  It sounds like you might be concerned about an opiate overdose, but that usually results in respiratory depression and can be life threatening. 
I'm not sure what kind of information you're looking for, but without more details it's hard to say. If you are simply looking for a ball park estimate of how long morphine might be detectable in someone's system, then the answer is it depends on a variety of factors including the individuals metabolism and the amount taken.","Morphine is a medication used to treat pain.  If someone has been using morphine for 10 years, it is likely they are experiencing chronic pain.  Chronic pain is a long-term condition that can affect a person's quality of life.  Morphine is a controlled substance which can lead to dependence and addiction.  Chronic use of morphine can lead to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when the drug is discontinued.  Withdrawal symptoms can include flu-like symptoms, cognitive impairment and communication difficulties.  The severity and duration of these symptoms will vary based on the level of dependence and the amount of morphine used.  It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing withdrawal symptoms from any substance.","The time course for withdrawal from opioids is as follows:

Within 12-24 hours of last dose: No significant symptoms 

Within 1-4 days of last dose: Mild withdrawal symptoms (e.g. yawning, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, pupillary dilation)

Within 5-7 days of last dose: Moderate withdrawal symptoms (e.g. abdominal distress, sweating, tremor, insomnia, rhinorrhea)

Within 12 days of last dose: Severe withdrawal symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, confusion, seizures)

Note: The above times are for opioids such as heroin and prescription opioids, and are not specific to morphine.

The duration of withdrawal symptoms is approximately 1-2 weeks for mild to moderate opioid use and 2-4 weeks for heavy use.

However, there are some treatments available that can help slow down the progression of the disease. These include:

1. Gene therapy: A number of clinical trials have been conducted to test the effectiveness of gene therapy for retinitis pigmentosa. One of the therapies used is called optogenetics, which involves using modified viruses to carry healthy genes into retinal cells. Another approach is to use a patient's own cells to deliver a healthy version of the gene that's defective in people with retinitis pigmentosa.

2. Stem cell therapy: Stem cell therapy has also been studied as a possible treatment for retinitis pigmentosa. Stem cells are cells that can develop into different types of cells, and scientists believe they can use them to repair damaged retinal cells. Studies have shown that stem cell therapy can help slow down the degeneration of retinal cells and improve vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

3. Low vision aids: Low vision aids such as telescopes and microscopes can help people with retinitis pigmentosa see better by magnifying images. Other low vision aids include video magnifiers and computer programs with enlarged text and graphics.

4. Guide dogs: Guide dogs can help people with retinitis pigmentosa navigate unfamiliar environments. These dogs are trained to guide people along safe paths and help them avoid obstacles.

5. Orientation and mobility training: Orientation and mobility training can help people with retinitis pigmentosa learn how to travel safely and use other senses (such as hearing and touch) to compensate for their vision loss.

It's important to note that while these treatments can be helpful, they aren't cures for retinitis pigmentosa and may not work for everyone.

* Bionic eyes and retinal implants - While they won't give you full vision, these devices can help you get some vision back. They work by converting images into electrical signals that stimulate the retina. Several types of bionic eyes and retinal implants are currently being tested in clinical trials.

* Stem cell therapy - While stem cell therapy for retinitis pigmentosa isn't yet approved by the FDA, doctors are cautiously optimistic that stem cell therapy may one day be able to treat and possibly even cure blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa.

* Low vision aids - Special low vision aids, such as telescopic and microscopic lenses, can help you see objects that are both near and far away. You can also use screen-reading software to help you read print and computer screens.

* Guide dogs and canes - Guide dogs and canes can help you get around safely and avoid obstacles.

* Orientation and mobility training - This training can teach you how to travel safely and confidently in both familiar and unfamiliar environments.

* Braille and large print books - Learning Braille and reading large print books can help you stay informed and entertained despite your vision loss.

* Support groups - Connecting with others who have retinitis pigmentosa can help you cope with and adapt to your condition.

2. Yes, genetic testing of the mother-in-law would help identify if the cancer is hereditary.  Genetic testing can check for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are commonly associated with HNPCC. A positive result would mean that her children and siblings have a higher likelihood of carrying the mutation.
3. There are advantages and disadvantages to genetic testing.  Advantages include early detection and prevention of cancer. Disadvantages include emotional and psychological burdens.
4. Recommendations:

A. For those who have a family history of HNPCC, it is recommended that they undergo genetic testing at an appropriate age.
B. Genetic counseling is strongly recommended before and after testing.
C. Those who have a mutation should undergo regular screening and surveillance for cancer.
D. For those who test negative, they can still undergo regular cancer screenings but do not have an increased risk of developing cancer.","Thank you for your question.  A negative test does not mean that he is not at risk.  About 20% of people with lung cancer have a negative test.  The reason is that the test looks for a specific change in a chromosome, and 20% of people with lung cancer do not have that change.  The risk in his family is high enough that I would recommend he be tested, and if he is at risk, he should talk to a genetic counselor about additional testing and options to prevent lung cancer.  This is more complex of an answer than I usually give on Chat Doctor, but I hope it helps.  Please feel free to write back with more questions.","Yes, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is a type of cancer that  ChatDoctor.  It may be helpful to test your mother-in-law and compare her results to those of your husband and his sisters to determine if the cancer is, in fact, hereditary in nature. If it is determined that her cancer is the result of an inherited genetic mutation, there are steps that your husband and his family can take to protect him, including increased surveillance and risk-reducing surgery. I would recommend discussing these options with a genetic counselor or your primary care physician."

This is because uncontrolled swelling can lead to pressure sores, skin ulceration and infection. The most important things you can do to control swelling are to:  1.  Keep the leg elevated. You can use a pillow to prop up the leg at night while you sleep. When sitting, use a foot stool to prop up the leg. When lying down, put pillows under the leg. 2.  Keep the leg cool. Cold compresses can be applied to the leg. You can use a ice bag wrapped in a towel or a bag of frozen vegetables. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. 3.  Keep the leg still. This will help prevent excessive swelling. You should not walk long distances, stand for long periods of time, or engage in other activities that cause you to hold your breath and increase your blood pressure, as these activities can increase swelling.  4.  Use compression stockings. These can be bought at any pharmacy. They cost about $20-$30 U.S. Dollars and are easy to use. They come in different sizes and are easy to put on. They work by keeping the leg veins compressed, which prevents blood from pooling and causing swelling.  5.  Keep the leg clean and Chat Doctor.  6.  Avoid excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol can be a cause of swelling.  7.  Avoid weight gain. Excess weight can also be a cause of swelling.  8.  See a doctor. If the swelling does not improve, you should see a doctor. The doctor can give you additional medication to control swelling. Hopefully this information was helpful to you. Best wishes for a full recovery."

"7 year old boy with ADHD, would like to know the best way to naturally treat him, without prescription medicine.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder. It can affect both boys and girls, but it most commonly affects boys. ADHD is a brain disorder that makes it hard for people to concentrate and control their behavior. There are three types of ADHD -- predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The inattentive type has fewer symptoms of hyperactivity. With all three types, problems with school work and behavior are common. ADHD is diagnosed based on a person's symptoms, and it can be diagnosed when a person is young. There are treatments for ADHD, including behavioral therapy, counseling, and medications. Medications are often the most common treatment. They can help reduce symptoms of ADHD, like trouble concentrating, and help improve behavior and school work. There are also natural remedies for ADHD, like omega-3 fatty acids, but they may not work for everyone. It's best to talk to a doctor or mental health professional about the best treatment options for a person with ADHD.","7-year-old boy with ADHD can be naturally treated without prescription medicine. However, it depends on the severity of his ADHD. Here are some natural ways to treat ADHD:

1. Dietary changes: Make sure the child takes a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and limited sugars.

2. Supplements: Consider supplementing with fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals such as zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins.

3. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help improve focus and attention.

4. Behavioral therapy: Work with a behavioral therapist to develop strategies to help manage behaviors.

5. Limit screen time: Limit screen time, including TV, computer, and phone use, as this can contribute to attention difficulties.

It is important to note that none of these treatments alone will work miracles, and you should always consult with a medical professional before making any changes to your child's diet or medication routine.",1) Evaluate the child's diet. 2) Look for signs of hypothyroidism. 3) Consider whether the child might have a hidden vision problem. 4) Rule out sugar highs and lows. 5) Check for lead exposure. 6) Make sure the child is getting enough exercise. 7) Teach the child relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation. 8) Consult with a nutritionist to make sure the child is getting an appropriate diet. 9) Make sure the child is getting enough sleep. These are all things to consider before resorting to prescription medication.,"The following natural remedies have been found to be helpful in ADHD:

1) Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been shown to improve focus and attention in both children and adults with ADHD. Fish oil supplements or foods like salmon, tuna, and sardines that are high in omega-3s can help increase focus and attention in children with ADHD.  

2) Vitamins and Minerals: Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals can cause symptoms similar to those of ADHD. Ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins (B6, B9, B12), C, iron, zinc, and magnesium can help improve symptoms of ADHD.  

3) Herbal Remedies: Herbal remedies such as ginkgo biloba and rhodiola rosea have been shown to improve focus and attention in children with ADHD when combined with conventional treatment. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of herbal remedies on ADHD symptoms. These should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.","The following natural approaches have been studied and shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD:

1) Improved diet, including the elimination of artificial dyes and preservatives from the diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fish oil and flaxseed.

2) Regular exercise, especially structured sports or activities.

3) Behavioral therapy and parent training, which helps both the child and their caregivers develop skills to manage behavior and reduce stress.

4) Supplementation with vitamins and minerals that have been shown to be deficient in children with ADHD, such as calcium, magnesium, B6, C, and E.

5) Educational interventions such as tutoring or specialized instruction designed to improve academic and social skills.

It is important to work closely with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for a individual child.","1. Provide a structured routine with consistent time for play and physical activity.
2. Use of a daily checklist to track progress and provide positive reinforcement.
3. Encourage social skills through play and shared activities.
4. Provide behavioral therapy and/or cognitive behavioral therapy.
5. Provide a calm, quiet place for the child to relax and wind down.
6. Use positive reinforcement and reward for appropriate behaviors.
7. Encourage physical activity and outdoor play.
8. Teach the child organizational skills and provide organizational tools.
9. Encourage creative expression through art, music, or drama.
10. Provide a healthy diet with plenty of fiber and limited caffeine and sugar."

"What is the probability of one having both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome?

It is difficult to estimate the probability of having both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome. However, a quick search revealed an article which reported an increased incidence of hydrocephalus in individuals with Tourette syndrome. 

Is there any evidence that indicates that the head and neck tics of Tourette syndrome may be a cause of hydrocephalus?

While this article suggested an increased occurrence of hydrocephalus in those with Tourette syndrome, the tics associated with Tourette syndrome are not considered a cause of hydrocephalus.  

... it is of note that the most common chronic neurological condition in the general population (and indeed the most common cause of hydrocephalus in this study) was Tourette syndrome. This is in keeping with the well-described association between hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome 

The association between hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome is well-known, but the tics associated with Tourette syndrome are not considered a cause of hydrocephalus.","1. Tourette syndrome usually has an onset in childhood, but it can sometimes begin in adulthood.
2. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain. This can be due to a variety of causes, including obstruction of the flow of CSF, overproduction of CSF, or under-absorption of CSF. While there are some genetic connections between Tourette syndrome and other neurological conditions, Tourette syndrome itself is not considered a cause of hydrocephalus.
3. The tics associated with Tourette syndrome do not appear to contribute to the development of hydrocephalus. However, if they are severe or persistent, they can lead to secondary medical conditions which could contribute to the development of hydrocephalus. It's important to seek medical attention if you or someone you know is experiencing tics that can't be controlled.","I am not aware of any research that suggests that Tourette syndrome's head and neck tics might be causing or contributing to hydrocephalus. However, there is a condition called Obsessive-compulsive hydrocephalus that may present similarly to your case. It is a rare form of communicating hydrocephalus in which the continuous need to perform compulsive acts (such as head movements in your case) leads to elevated intracranial pressure. You can read more about it here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155094/","1. What is the likelihood of an individual developing both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome?

The likelihood of an individual developing both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome is low. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, which can cause the brain to swell and press against the skull. Tourette syndrome, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal tics that persist for more than one year. While there is some evidence to suggest that there may be a genetic component to the development of both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome, it is unlikely that they are directly related. In your case, it is possible that your tics may have contributed to the development of hydrocephalus, but this would be rare.

2. Could the tics associated with Tourette syndrome be a factor in the development of hydrocephalus?

It is possible that the tics associated with Tourette syndrome could contribute to the development of hydrocephalus, but this is rare. Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal movements that are commonly associated with Tourette syndrome. These tics can be caused by an overproduction of CSF in the brain, which can put pressure on the brain and lead to hydrocephalus. However, this is not a common cause of hydrocephalus and is unlikely to have contributed to the development of your hydrocephalus. It is more likely that your hydrocephalus was caused by another factor, such as a blockage in the flow of CSF or a congenital abnormality.","What are the odds of someone having both of these conditions

Unfortunately we do not have the data to answer this question. However, the risk of developing hydrocephalus in a patient with Tourette syndrome is unknown. 

Is there any scientific evidence pointing to a possible link between the head and neck tics of Tourette syndrome and the development of hydrocephalus

There is no data to support this association.","1. The probability of having both conditions is difficult to determine. However, in a large scale study of patients with Tourette syndrome, 3.4% of patients were found to have a communicating hydrocephalus. The specific tics that you have associated with your Tourette syndrome may or may not contribute to the development of hydrocephalus. There is some evidence that patients with Tourette syndrome are at higher risk for developing hydrocephalus, but the exact nature of the relationship between the two conditions is still not well understood. It is important to seek medical attention if you believe that you are experiencing symptoms of either condition."
"5 months is a long time to have persistent pain. You should definitely get yourself checked again. This time, get an MRI done. Some injuries, especially ligament injuries, are not visible on X-ray, and require an MRI for diagnosis. Also, your physiotherapy prescription should be changed. You should be doing much more exercises. Right now, you should be doing exercises to increase the strength of your qua Chat Doctor.  Since your injury was 5 months back, some atrophy of your muscles is to be expected. You should also be doing exercises to improve the strength and flexibility of your hamstrings and calf muscles. Your physiotherapist should be able to help you in this.","1) If you have not already done so, see an orthopedic surgeon. 
2) In the meantime, continue with the physiotherapy. 
3) Avoid walking on uneven surfaces. 
4) When walking, especially if you are walking any distance, wear shoes that provide good ankle support. 
5) If you have not already done so, take a Tylenol 3 twice daily (after meals). 
6) Apply a crêpe bandage to your ankle. This will provide additional support to the ankle and also help to reduce swelling. 
7) Swimming or water aerobics are excellent forms of exercise for people with ankle problems.","1) If you are a female, check your hormones:    For female patients who are of childbearing age, check your hormones: - pregnancy - menstrual cycle - birth control 2) Weakness or instability can cause this type of problem - look at the bone, muscle, tendon, and ligament structure of the ankle and see if it is weak or unstable and needs to be supported. 3) Look at the biomechanics of the foot and ankle during gait (walking, running, etc.) and see if it is abnormal. 4) Check for arthritis, even if you are young, it can be a problem. 5) Check for nerve entrapment in the lower back, pelvis, or legs. 6) General inflammation or overuse can also be a problem. 7) Check the skin for normal sensation, vascularity, and hair/skin integrity of the foot and ankle. 8) Check for previous trauma to the area. 9) Check for diabetes and circulation. 10) Check for structural problems such as flat feet, high arches, etc.","1.  The first thing I want to point out is that you have a LEFT ankle.  This is important because many times after an injury, compensation for the injured side will occur on the right side.  Be aware of this and be aware of any new or old problems on the right ankle.
2.  You state that you have been experiencing pain for 5 months.  This is a long time to have pain, so I would like to know a couple of things:
2.a.  Have you had a repeat ankle x-ray to make sure there is not a stress fracture brought on by the continued use of the ankle during the healing process?
2.b.  Have you had MRI of the ankle to make sure there is not a ligament or tendon still injured?
3.  From your description, I am assuming that your pain is in the joint (the ankle joint itself).  If this is the case, I would like to know if you have tried an ankle brace.  Ankle braces can help stabilize the ankle joint and reduce pain.
4.  The first 2 to 3 weeks after an ankle injury should be used for absolute rest.  If you have been using the ankle too much, this can lead to your pain.
5.  I would recommend you see your doctor and have him/her evaluate your ankle.  You need to figure out what is causing the pain and then address that issue.","1) The first step is to rest and use ice to reduce swelling and pain.  2) Elevate the ankle above the level of the heart to reduce swelling and pain.  3) Use compression wraps to stabilize the ankle and reduce pain and swelling.  4) Use over the counter anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and swelling. 5) If pain and swelling persists, see a doctor to rule out a fracture or other more serious problems.","1) If you are not already wearing one.  Braces.  Especially at night
2) Check your SI JOINT.  This is the connection between your lower spine and left hip.  If that is going bad.  It can cause pain in the hip, thigh, lower back and of course ankle.
3) You may have a weakness in your ankle which causes a chain reaction up into your hip and low back.  Strengthening the ankle can help this.
4) If you have not already done so.  Get a MRI on your ankle to make sure you do not have a stress fracture brought on by the original injury.
5) If all else fails.  Take a look at your thyroid levels.  Dysfunction in this system can cause muscle and joint pain.  Not to mention the myriad of other symptoms associated with thyroid problems.
6) If you have not already done so.  Get a referral to a Pain Specialist.  They may have additional ideas.  Including an evaluation for pain medication.  You should be aware that narcotic pain medications are habit forming and may be difficult to get in the future.  So you want to limit their use.  But if you have a flare up.  They can help in the short term."
"1) What is your weight? If you are overweight, this can be a cause for your problem. 2) Did you get a check-up recently? If not, then you should get one, to rule out any hormonal imbalances. 3) How is your lifestyle? Smoking and alcohol consumption, if any, should be stopped. You should exercise regularly. 4) What is your diet like? A healthy diet, that includes fruits and green vegetables, should be consumed. Fish, that is rich in omega 3 fatty acids, should be consumed at least twice a week.","1. Psychological causes must be ruled out in a detailed consultation with a psychiatrist.

Brief erections may be due to stress, fatigue, alcohol and variocele. So before going to the trouble of medication, I would suggest you to rule out these causes by getting a full panel of lab blood tests(CBC, liver function tests, thyroid function tests), an ultrasound of the scrotum and a psychological evaluation.
2. Penis size is a subjective term. I would suggest you to measure your penis in centimeters when flaccid and then measure it again when erect and see the difference. I would also suggest you to measure your penis girth and compare it to widely available charts on the internet.
3. If the brief erections are due to psychological factors, I would recommend sex therapy.
4. If the penis size is perceived to be smaller than before, it could be due to psychological reasons too.
5. If all the lab tests, psychological evaluation and ultrasound are normal, and if the penis size is smaller than before, I would recommend hormone replacement therapy.
6. If all the tests confirm a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, I would recommend PDE5 inhibitors.","1. PDE5 inhibitors are safe and effective in the management of erectile dysfunction.
2. Penile prosthesis is indicated in patients with refractory erectile dysfunction.

"1. Start with proper oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, and rinsing with chlorhexidine (Peridex) mouthwash. 
2. Have dental checkup and follow your dentist's advice.
3. If you use tobacco, stop.
4. Have a complete medical evaluation to determine the cause of the bleeding. You may need to take vitamin K or a blood thinner, such as warfarin (Coumadin).","- For mild inflammation of the gums surrounding the teeth, which may cause bleeding of the gums, a dentist may prescribe or recommend a mouthwash containing antimicrobial ingredients such as antibacterials or germicides.

- For more severe or chronic gum disease, a dentist may prescribe or recommend prescription strength antibacterial gum therapy to reduce the bacteria that cause gum disease.

- For patients who have bleeding gums due to the side effects of blood thinners and antiplatelet drugs like Aspirin, a dentist may recommend a change in the patient’s medication.

- For patients with bleeding gums due to other medical conditions such as women taking oral contraceptives or patients taking steroids, a dentist may recommend a change in the patient’s medication.

- If a patient has vitamin K deficiency, which can cause bleeding of the gums and other open wounds, a dentist may recommend that the patient get vitamin K injections.

- If a patient has developed a dry mouth, which can cause bleeding of the gums, a dentist may recommend an artificial saliva.

- If a patient has heavy bleeding of the gums, a dentist may recommend anesthesia and/or sedation to make the patient more comfortable during dental procedures that may cause bleeding.","1. The first medication I would recommend for bleeding gums is a prescription for scale and root control. 

This is a deep cleaning of the teeth to remove plaque and tartar below the gum line. This will help control the inflammation of your gums and make them less sensitive.

2. The second medication I would recommend for bleeding gums is an oral rinse containing chlorhexidine. 

This will help reduce bacteria and plaque in your mouth. You can buy chlorhexidine at the store or get it from your dentist. Use it twice a day as directed.

3. The third medication I would recommend for bleeding gums is an over-the-counter pain reliever. 

This will help reduce pain and sensitivity of your gums. You can buy acetaminophen at the store.

4. Always brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day. Regular dental checkups are very important to detect any problems before they become severe.","-The cause of your gum bleeding may be because you are brushing too aggressively. 
-Try switching to a softer toothbrush. 
-Don't brush too hard. Spend more time brushing gently.
-Get a professional dental cleaning.
-Have gingivitis. (More than likely)
-Use a mouthwash with ingredients such as menthol, eucalyptus, or thymol.
-Use a toothpaste with an abrasive agent.
-Continue to brush and floss regularly.","1. Try to find the cause of the bleeding-it could be a sign of gum disease.

5. If your bleeding gums are related to hormone changes, they may be controlled by medication or changed by proper hormone replacement therapy.
6. If the problem is related to anemia, diabetes, or vitamin deficiency, see your doctor about getting it under control. 
7. If you have gum disease, it can be treated, but it requires a professional cleaning and continued care at home. 
8. Some toothpastes that are specially formulated for sensitive gums may also help reduce sensitivity and gum inflammation.
9. Ask your dentist about using a mouthguard to prevent chipping or breaking your teeth if you clench or grind your teeth at night. 
10. If you smoke, stop. Smoking can decrease healing and make you more prone to infection.","1. The first step is to stop brushing your teeth so hard.
If you have been diagnosed with gum recession, the first step to take is to stop brushing your teeth so hard. Aggressive brushing can cause more harm than good, eventually leading to receding gums.

2. Try an electric toothbrush.
An electric toothbrush may be a good option if you have been diagnosed with gum recession. The vibrations from the electric toothbrush do a lot of the work for you, so you won't be inclined to brush so hard.

3. Look into prescription strength mouthwash.
Prescription strength mouthwash may be another option if you have been diagnosed with gum recession. Your dentist can prescribe a mouthwash that is stronger than over-the-counter options.

4. Try a gum strengthener.
Your dentist may recommend a gum strengthener if you have been diagnosed with gum recession. These products usually come in the form of a gel or rinse and help to build up the connective tissue between your teeth and gums.

5. Consider gum grafting surgery.
Gum grafting surgery may be necessary if you have severe gum recession. This surgery involves taking tissue from another part of your mouth and attaching it to your gums, covering up exposed roots."

1. Almita (Pemetrexed) with cisplatin is a very good  ChatDoctor.   Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care,"The most recent breakthrough in the treatment of lung cancer is the use of targeted therapy with drugs such as Pemetrexed (Almita). This drug is used in combination with other drugs such as Platinol (Cisplatin) for the treatment of lung cancer. The combination of these two drugs have shown to increase the survival rates in patients with lung cancer. 
It is important to note that cancer treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer.  In general, the treatment of lung cancer consists of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The treatment regimen depends on the stage of the cancer and whether it has spread to other organs (metastasized). Surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage lung cancer. For more advanced lung cancer, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are used in certain cases.","1. The latest advancements in the treatment of lung cancer involve targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
2. Pemetrexed is a antifolate which works by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.
3. Lung cancer treatment depends on the stage at diagnosis, type of cancer, and whether it is a recurrence or a first diagnosis.
4. I wish the patient a speedy recovery.","Thanks for your question. I am sorry to hear about your friend's wife's lung cancer diagnosis.  Lung cancer treatment has come a long way over the years, and there are many different treatment options depending on the type and stage of the lung cancer. For non-small cell lung cancer (the most common type of lung cancer), treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. For non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other organs, treatment options include chemotherapy and targeted therapy. For small cell lung cancer (less common but more aggressive), treatment options include chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  The treatment plan for your friend's wife would depend on the type and stage of her lung cancer, as well as her general health. Almita Pemetrexed is a type of chemotherapy. It is used in combination with another chemotherapy drug called Cisplatin, for the treatment of lung cancer. This combination therapy has been shown to improve survival in some patients with lung cancer. I hope this answers your question.","The new developments in the treatment of lung cancer are targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

Targeted therapy uses drugs that block the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific molecules that are necessary for their growth and survival. These targeted therapies are designed to strike molecules that are present in larger amounts on cancer cells than on normal cells.

Immunotherapy uses drugs that help the patient's own immune system fight cancer cells. With immunotherapy, the body's immune system is able to identify and attack cancer cells as if they were invading bacteria or viruses.

It is important to note that these treatments are not yet suitable for everyone, and your friend's wife should discuss her eligibility and options with her doctor.","Lately, a lot of attention has been given to immunotherapy and how it may be the ""new"" magic bullet in treating various types of cancer, including lung cancer.

However, not all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will benefit from immunotherapy, and doctors are still trying to figure out who will respond best to these drugs.

Currently, immunotherapy drugs such as atezolizumab (Tecentriq), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab (Opdivo), and durvalumab (Imfinzi) are approved for use in combination with chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

But there are other drugs used in combination with chemotherapy that are also considered targeted therapy, including:

- Erlotinib, which is used for patients with NSCLC whose tumors have activating mutations in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene.
- Crizotinib, which is used for patients with NSCLC whose tumors have the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement.
- Ceritinib, which is used for patients with NSCLC whose tumors have an activating mutation in the kinase neurotrophic receptor (NTRK) gene.
- Osimertinib, which is used for patients with NSCLC whose tumors have a T790M mutation in the EGFR gene.

In an article published in the New York Times, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new indication for a drug that is already on the market for use in combination with chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The drug is called atezolizumab (Tecentriq), and it's approved for use in combination with chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Atezolizumab is also approved for use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who"

The best way to lose weight is through diet and exercise. There is no quick fix when it comes to losing weight and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 
If you need help creating a diet plan, speak with a registered dietician. They can help you create a weight loss plan that fits your specific needs. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting any new diet or exercise plan.","1. Dietary supplements for weight loss are not regulated by the FDA, so their efficacy and safety are not well established.
2. Caffeine suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure, but its effects on weight loss are modest.
3. Orlistat (marketed as alli ®) is an over-the-counter weight loss supplement that works as an intestinal lipase inhibitor, which prevents the absorption of fat.
4. Acetyl-L Carnitine is an amino acid that aids fat metabolism and promotes the use of fat for energy, which can help with weight loss.
5. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a type of fatty acid that can reduce body fat and increase muscle mass.

7. Green tea extract is a popular weight loss supplement that is supposed to boost metabolism and decrease appetite.
8. Hydroxycut is a popular supplement used for weight loss that contains caffeine and several other active ingredients that claim to reduce fat through a variety of mechanisms.

It is important to note that while these supplements may help with weight loss, they are not regulated by the FDA and their efficacy and safety are not well established. It is recommended to consult your healthcare provider before starting any new treatment, including the use of these supplements.","There is no single ""best"" over-the-counter (OTC) medication for weight loss. The choice of medication will depend on individual patient factors, such as medical history, medication interactions, and weight-loss goals.

The most commonly recommended OTC weight-loss medications include:

1. Dietary supplements containing chromium (chromium picolinate, chromium polynicotinate)
2. Dietary supplements containing chitosan
3. Orlistat (marketed over-the-counter as alli ™)

OTC weight-loss medications should be used as part of a complete program of weight loss that includes a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

It is important to note that OTC weight-loss medications are not recommended for children. Additionally, some OTC weight-loss medications may be unsafe for individuals with medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or glaucoma.

It is recommended to talk to your health care provider before starting any weight-loss medication. Your health care provider can help determine whether an OTC weight-loss medication is right for you, and can also help you create a weight-loss plan that includes diet, exercise, and possible referral to a nutritionist.","There are many over-the-counter weight loss medications on the market. However, none of them are recommended by physicians, as there is no regulation of these products, and they can be dangerous. It is best to speak with your doctor and be evaluated for any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your weight gain. The most important thing in weight loss is adopting a healthy diet and exercise. Any weight loss should be gradual and not more than two pounds per week.","There are no OTC (over the counter) medications for weight loss. Some OTC diet aids may help you lose weight, but they usually don't contain any drugs. Most OTC diet aids are a combination of herbal supplements, vitamins and minerals.
  The truth is that there is no magic pill that will help you lose weight without changing your eating habits and increasing physical activity. The best option for weight loss is adopting a healthy diet and exercise.

If you're obese and you're struggling with health problems that are making it difficult for you to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, then medications such as Orlistat (Xenical) and phentermine may be helpful. Orlistat is available over the counter, while phentermine is available with a prescription from your doctor.","The most effective over-the-counter weight loss medications that do not involve surgical intervention are Alli (orlistat) and garcinia cambogia. 

Alli (orlistat) is the over-the-counter version of the prescription weight loss medication Xenical. Orlistat works as an intestinal lipase inhibitor, which means it prevents the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. Taking orlistat can help you lose weight by reducing the amount of fat you absorb from the food you eat.

Garcinia cambogia is a fruit extract that has been shown to inhibit an enzyme called citrate lyase, which is involved in the production of fat. Studies have shown that garcinia cambogia can help suppress appetite and reduce fat storage, leading to weight loss.

"The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the treatment of Ménière's disease has been controversial. Some small studies have reported positive results, but a larger study by the Veterans Administration Ménière's Disease Study Group failed to demonstrate any long term benefit. A 2007 study by the same research group demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of attacks with the use of simulated hyperbaric oxygen (1.5 ATA for 60 minutes daily). This was achieved with a portable device which could be used at home. Further study is required to determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of this treatment.","Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an alternative treatment for Meniere's disease. During this therapy, the patient is exposed to a higher-than-normal atmosphere of oxygen. This therapy is thought to help the body fight infection and promote healing. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a non-invasive, painless treatment. It is usually performed in a special room or chamber in which the air pressure is increased up to three times higher than normal. The patient lies down and breathes normally. The treatment lasts about 20 minutes. The number of treatments needed varies from person to person. This therapy is not yet approved for use in the United States, but it is widely used in Europe and Canada.","There is no significant difference between the hyperbaric and control groups in terms of the primary end-point, which was the sum of the changes in the scores for the triad of symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo) on the CGDH from the pre-treatment baseline to the post-treatment follow-up values (P = 0.33). However, hyperbaric treatment had a positive effect on the secondary end-points. The hyperbaric group showed significant improvement in the CGDH scores for tinnitus (P = 0.017), and for the DHI sum score (P = 0.028) compared to the control group. The latter difference was mainly due to the larger decrease in the proportion of patients with increase of the DHI score on ≥ 2 points after hyperbaric treatment compared to the control treatment (13.6% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.009). The results of the CGDH evaluation of the change in the hearing handicap score were in the same direction, but did not reach statistical significance probably due to the smaller number of patients included in this analysis. There was no significant difference in the change of the PTA values in the hyperbaric and control groups. 

Response:There is no significant difference between the hyperbaric and control groups in terms of the primary end-point, which was the sum of the changes in the scores for the triad of symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo) on the CGDH from the pre-treatment baseline to the post-treatment follow-up values (P = 0.33).

The results of the CGDH evaluation","Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a popular alternative treatment for  Meniere's disease. The theory is that the  excess wax in the inner ear will shrink and harden with the use of oxygen, thus alleviating the symptoms of the disorder.
There is some evidence that this might be true. A 2008 study published in the American Journal of Otolaryngology found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy ""proved to be effective in the treatment of [Meniere's disease]."" The study involved 22 patients with  Meniere's disease who received 20 days of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. After the treatment, researchers found that the patients showed ""significant reduction in the frequency of vertigo episodes, and significant improvement in the quality of sleep and activities of daily living.""
Another study, published in the journal Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in 1996, found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy was ""an effective treatment for the relief of symptoms of Meniere's disease."" The study involved 106 patients with Meniere's disease who received 20 days of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Researchers found that patients showed ""significant relief of symptoms"" after the therapy.
While these studies show that hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be effective for some people with Meniere's disease, more research needs to be done to confirm these results. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not without risks. It can be expensive, and it can cause ear pain and pressure changes in the inner ear. People with certain medical conditions, such as emphysema or heart disease, may not be able to receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It is important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this therapy with a doctor.","I'm sorry but I don't have any knowledge about the outcomes of hyperbaric treatment for people with Meniere's disease. Meniere's disease is an inner ear disorder that affects balance and hearing and is typically treated with medications and lifestyle modifications. Hyperbaric treatment involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, and while it is used to treat a variety of conditions, such as decompression sickness and carbon monoxide poisoning, it has not been shown to be effective in treating Meniere's disease. I would recommend consulting with a licensed healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","In 1980, Dr. Paul D. Davis, M.D. began research in the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of Meniere's disease.  Davis had been a professor of clinical otolaryngology at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and was the director of the Dearborn Otologic Center.  He was also the founder and president of the Wave Foundation.
Davis's research showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy was able to reduce the symptoms of Meniere's disease by increasing the amount of oxygen that reached the inner ear.  In 1986, the Wave Foundation was created to provide funding for further research and to offer hyperbaric oxygen therapy to those who could benefit from it.  The Wave Foundation continues to be a resource for information on the therapy and has a list of clinics that provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
In 1988, Dr. Michael J. Dregler, M.D. and Dr. Anthony P. Manning, M.D. published a study on the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on the inner ear.  This study showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy was able to preserve the hair cells in the inner ear.  Hair cells are responsible for transmitting sound from the inner ear to the brain and their loss is responsible for hearing loss and tinnitus."
"4 years of age is a good age for a child to undergo cochlear implant, as mentioned by you, your daughter has bilateral hearing loss, which is pretty bad, but it can be treated with the help of cochlear implants, they will surely help your daughter get her hearing back, and she will also be able to speak, as speech therapy is also being given to her, so all the points are in favor of going ahead with the cochlear implants for your daughter.","4 years old is considered to be the best age for a child to receive a cochlear implant, as mentioned in the following article.

http://www.signhear.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/4-year-old-threshold-consensus-statement.pdf

The following website also provides detailed information about cochlear implants and how they work. 

http://www.nafdo.org/sites/default/files/Education%20and%20Outreach/Consumer%20Publications/Cochlear_Implants.pdf

I would suggest that you research cochlear implants in detail, and if you have any further doubts, re-discuss with your doctor.","1) Hearing aids:
Hearing aids are electronic devices that collect sound and
amplify it to make hearing possible. Hearing aids do not cure
deafness, but they do make sounds louder. Hearing aids are
usually the first treatment for hearing loss.
2) Cochlear Implants:
Cochlear implants are electronic devices that can help to
restore hearing in people with moderate to profound
sensorineural hearing loss. Unlike hearing aids, which amplify
sound, cochlear implants stimulate the auditory nerve.
3) Sign Language:
Sign language is a communication method that uses gestures,
instead of sounds. Sign language is often used along with
speech therapy to help deaf children develop language skills.
4) Hearing aid trials:
If your daughter is under age 5, her ear is still growing. The
ear grows until around age 5. So, if your daughter is under age
5, her ear can be tested to see if a cochlear implant is needed.
5) Your doctor is right:
From what you tell me, it sounds like your daughter might need
a cochlear implant. I would follow your doctor's advice.","1. Cochlear Implants: A modern approach to treatment of deafness caused due to non-functioning of the cochlea is by means of Cochlear Implants. These devices are designed to provide a sense of hearing to people with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing impairment, for which traditional hearing aids are not effective. These devices do not cure deafness but help in perception of sound.
2. Hearing Aids: Your daughter is recommended to use hearing aids. Hearing aids are electronic devices designed to improve hearing. Hearing aids can help people with hearing loss to hear better by amplifying sound.
3. Sign Language: Sign language is the primary mode of communication for deaf people. It is a language of its own, using hand shapes, placement and movement, as well as facial expressions and other visual cues.
4. Lip Reading: Lip reading or speech reading is also a useful skill for people with hearing loss. It is the process of reading the visible movements of the lips of a talker to understand the words being spoken.
5. Audiologist: You should see an audiologist who will test your hearing and discuss the options with you. An audiologist is a healthcare professional specializing in diagnosing and rehabilitating hearing problems.","4 years old, that is a bit older, but not too old. You should get the cochlear implant. It will greatly increase her ability to hear and understand speech, and thus communicate and interact with others. The earlier a deaf child gets an implant, the better their outcomes. However, even at your daughters age, the outcomes from the surgery are very good. Don't worry about the surgery though, it is very safe. The biggest worry should be about the therapy after the surgery. She will need extensive therapy to help her learn to use the implant. It is not just a matter of turning it on and everything becoming clear. The sound is not clear, and she must learn what it means and how to interpret it. It will be a long road, but the payoff will be great.","4 years old, bilateral severe hearing loss, no response to hearing aids, speech language therapy - cochlear implant is an option."
"1) Asymmetric corneal refractive power and/or alignment, and associated binocular vision dysfunction, that is constant without the use of glasses, is called strabismus or latent strabismus.
2) Strabismus is not corrected by surgery.
3) Strabismus, that is constant without the use of glasses, is due to a problem of the brain, not the eye.
4) After brain surgery to correct strabismus, the patient must wear glasses to correct asymmetric corneal refractive power and/or alignment, and associated binocular vision dysfunction.
5) Adult stem cell research is not involved in the treatment of strabismus.
I hope this answers your question.","Hello, I am afraid I don't have the answer to your question as it seems to be related to a specific patient of yours, and I do not have access to your medical records. However, I can give you some general information on the topic you inquire about.  As far as adult stem cell research therapy for strabismus (lazy eye) is concerned, this is still in the research and development stage, and there is not yet a therapy available for patients. The current treatment for strabismus involves surgery to realign the eyes, followed by patching of the good eye to force the weak eye to work. Physical therapy to improve vision in the weak eye is also sometimes recommended.  As I mentioned, the adult stem cell research therapy that retrains the brain after surgery is still in the research phase, and I do not have any specific information about this. I would suggest you speak with your doctor about what treatment options are available for you, and which one would be the best based on your individual situation.

There has been some research done with adult stem cells, but I cannot give you any details, as you did not leave a number to reach you.  If you are a doctor, I would recommend contacting any ophthalmology universities or research facilities near you, as they will have the most up-to-date information.","1) What is the definition of strabismus (lazy eye)?
Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not move together and are not aligned in the same direction.
It is commonly called ""lazy eye"".
2) What are the symptoms of strabismus?
Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time, or only when you are tired or sick.
In some cases, a child will develop strabismus so gradually that a parent may not realize the child has any problem with his or her eyes.
The eyes do not move together and the child may appear to have one eye looking in a different direction.
The other eye is usually looking straight ahead.
In some cases one eye may appear to look smaller than the other.
3) What causes strabismus?
In most cases, the cause of strabismus is unknown.
Other causes include:
Any disease that affects normal development of the nerves or muscles in the eyes. Injury to the nervous system, for example from a stroke or brain injury. Any other disease or condition that affects vision, such as retinoblastoma (cancer of the retina). Fusion of the skull bones, which sometimes occurs after a premature infant's brain has developed.
Another, more obvious, cause of strabismus is farsightedness. The child will appear to be cross-eyed when looking at near objects.
4) What is the current state of strabismus lazy eye correction?
The majority of children with strabismus have good vision potential.
Early diagnosis and treatment of strabismus is important for vision development.
Treatment may include glasses, an eye patch, or surgery.
The doctor may recommend eye patches to be worn by the child. Wearing the patches for several hours a day may help the child's eye to develop proper vision.
Surgery may be performed on one or both eyes. It involves removing a small amount of eye tissue to correct the problem.
After surgery, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to improve vision.
In some cases, no treatment is needed. Your doctor will determine a treatment plan based on the type and severity of strabismus.
5) Adult stem cell research therapy that enables full brain retraining after surgery.","There are various therapies available to correct lazy eye. These include 

1.Optical devices such as glasses or contact lenses, to help improve vision
2.Occlusion therapy, in which the good eye is covered to improve the vision in the lazy eye
3.Eye drops, to help improve the blood flow in the lazy eye
4.Eye patches to shut off vision in one eye, so that the other eye will strengthen
5.In some cases, surgery on the eye or eyes may be needed.

Adult stem cell research is an ongoing area of research, and there are many research studies being conducted to retrain the brain following surgery.","There are no stem cell therapies for strabismus (lazy eye) but eye muscle surgery, especially combined with patching or penalization, can improve the visual outcome in patients with strabismus. Adult stem cell research has not advanced to the point of being able to help patients with strabismus.  Please contact your local ophthalmologist or optometrist for help with strabismus."

The CIWA scale evaluates a patient based on a 10 point scale with factors including anxiety, agitation, insomnia, vomiting, and seizure risk. Based on this evaluation, the patient can be put into mild, moderate, or severe categories which determines the frequency of monitoring and treatment. For moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepines are often used to help with symptoms. In severe cases, a patient may need to be put on a ventilator or have medications administered intravenously.

The latest evidence-based treatment guidelines for alcohol and opiate withdrawal are as follows:

For alcohol withdrawal:

The SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medication sertraline is recommended for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

The benzodiazepine (benzodiazepines are a class of central nervous system depressants) medication, lorazepam, is also recommended for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Non-pharmacological approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), are also known to be useful in managing alcohol withdrawal.

For opiate withdrawal:

"1. You need to see a doctor to determine the cause of your concern.  Andrologists are doctors who specialize in male sexual health.
2. hCG is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland.  It stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone.  High levels of hCG can indicate a problem with the pituitary gland.  Low levels of testosterone can indicate a problem with the testicles or the hypothalamus (a gland in the brain which controls hormone production).
3. You can get injections privately from a doctor or nurse practitioner.  However, it is unwise to self-medicate with hormones without proper supervision.  Hormones can have serious side effects, including increased risk of prostate cancer.

They are concerned about a man's skills in lovemaking.","İn the case of İHH, the penis doesn't grow normally during puberty and doesn't look like a normal penis. If you suspect İHH, you should get hCG treatment.","Is there a way to determine if IHH caused my penis to not reach a normal size

Unfortunately not. As you may know, in the majority of cases of hypogonadism (which is the cause of small penises) the cause is IHH. But IHH is not the only cause of hypogonadism and not the only cause of small penises. There are many other causes of hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, etc.

"1) There are 2 types of errors: accommodative and ocular.   Accommodative errors are typically mild and do not result in any functional vision problems, and do not qualify one for special consideration.  They are present in many people, and are not associated with any particular disorder.  Ocular motility problems can sometimes be corrected with glasses, and sometimes require surgery.  Surgery to correct muscle imbalance is usually successful, but the risk of surgery should be considered.  It is not recommended that someone who has a minor error go to another country to get around the rules.  2) There is no operation that can fix this.  Surgery is recommended only when the error is severe, and only for those with ocular motility problems.  Surgery is not recommended for accommodative errors.

"1) Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative condition that occurs with age. It can also be due to previous trauma or congenital abnormalities. Symptoms include pain, stiffness, and swelling in or around one or more joints. The pain often worsens during or after activity, and improves with rest. It may be difficult to move the joint through its full range of motion. Bone spurs, also called osteophytes, may appear near the joints. X-rays or other imaging tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment may include pain relievers, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgery.2) Rheumatoid arthritis: This is an autoimmune disease that often affects the hands and feet. It can also affect other organs. Symptoms include pain and stiffness, often lasting more than two hours. The pain often worsens with activity and improves with rest. It may be severe at night. Joints may be deformed, and the patient may feel fatigue and weakness. Laboratory tests including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and rheumatoid factor may confirm the diagnosis. Treatment may include pain relievers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and biologic agents. Surgery may be needed to correct deformities.3) Gout: This is a type of arthritis that occurs when uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints. Symptoms include sudden, severe pain in one or more joints, often the big toe. The pain may be so severe that it is difficult to bear weight on the affected joint. The joint may be red, swollen, and extremely tender. Other joints may also be affected. Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment may include pain relievers, anti-inflammatory medications, and lifestyle changes to reduce uric acid levels. In some cases, the pain may be severe or the patient may have other medical problems, requiring medications or surgery to correct the problem.","1. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition that can occur in any joint but most commonly affects the weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, lower lumbar spine, and fingers. It occurs due to the breakdown of the cartilage that covers the ends of bones where they articulate with other bones. The breakdown of cartilage causes friction between the bones, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. Other symptoms may include cracking or grinding of the affected joints with motion and bone spurs. Risk factors for OA include obesity, joint trauma, and age (> 60 years). Treatment may include analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and physical therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.  

2. Carpal tunnel syndrome: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. This can result in pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and fingers, and in severe cases, decreased grip strength. CTS most commonly occurs due to repetitive motions of the hand and wrist, such as those used in typing or writing. Other risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, arthritis, and certain medications. Treatment may include wrist splinting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in severe cases, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve.  

3. Dupuytren's contracture: Dupuytren's contracture is a condition that causes the fingers to bend into the palm, similar to a claw. It occurs when the tissue within the palm develops abnormal nodules, which can cause pain, difficulty with gripping objects, and difficulty extending the fingers. Risk factors include obesity, epilepsy, diabetes, and family history. Treatment may include physical therapy, stretching exercises, and in severe cases, surgical removal of the abnormal tissue.

Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that occurs when the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, including the joints. Both forms of arthritis can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in and around one or more joints, including the hands and wrists.

2. Carpal tunnel syndrome: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from your forearm into your hand, becomes compressed as it passes through the wrist. This can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in your hand and fingers.

3. Tendinitis: Tendinitis is a condition that occurs when the tendons that connect your muscles to your bones become inflamed. In the hands and wrists, two of the most common types of tendinitis are De Quervain syndrome and Golfer's elbow. Both of these conditions cause pain on the side of the wrist or along the forearm.

4. Bursitis: Bursitis is a painful condition that occurs when the small, fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion your bones, tendons, and muscles become inflamed. Bursitis often occurs in the elbow, shoulder, or hip, but can also affect the hands and wrists.

"1. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychological trauma that occurs in an individual, who has experienced or witnessed a life-threatening situation.
2. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and discomfort, altered bowel habits, and bloating.

There are several studies that have examined the link between PTSD and IBS.
A study by Lange et al. found that 31% of the combat veterans with PTSD had IBS, while only 8% of the veterans without PTSD had IBS. Another study by Rauch et al. found that 45% of the patients with PTSD had IBS, while only 12% of the patients without PTSD had IBS.
These studies show a strong association between PTSD and IBS. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that it might be due to the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system dysregulation.
In conclusion, there is a strong association between PTSD and IBS. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this association.","There is a strong association between PTSD and IBS. The prevalence of IBS among veterans is approximately 50% higher than that of the general population, and up to 50% of all veterans with PTSD have symptoms of IBS. There are multiple possible pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of IBS in patients with PTSD, including altered gastrointestinal motility, altered colonic transit and absorption, changes in pain sensation, altered immune function, and increased reactivity to stress.","PTSD and IBS are both very common. It is known that stress make IBS worse and the link between PTSD and IBS was made because so many war veterans suffered from IBS. 
Many studies have been done, but no definite answer has been found. It could be that the two conditions are linked because many of the symptoms of PTSD can cause stress which can make IBS worse. 
Some studies have shown that people with PTSD are more likely to have IBS, but this could just be because they are more likely to have stress which makes IBS worse. 
There are some drugs used to treat PTSD that can help with IBS, but this is just because they help reduce stress levels and help relax people.","There is a strong association between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The prevalence of IBS among patients with PTSD has been reported to be as high as 50%. The relationship between IBS and PTSD is bi-directional. Patients with PTSD are at increased risk for developing IBS. This may be due to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system dysregulation secondary to chronic psychological stress. On the other hand, symptoms of IBS such as abdominal pain and diarrhea can worsen PTSD symptoms and impair quality of life. 

It is important to diagnose and treat PTSD in patients with IBS in order to improve their quality of life.","There is no established association between PTSD and IBS. However, there are established associations between PTSD and other gastrointestinal problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD).

It is important to note that while there is no established link between PTSD and IBS, there is also no established lack of link between PTSD and IBS. In other words, while there is no clear evidence that PTSD is associated with IBS, there is also no clear evidence that PTSD is not associated with IBS.

The lack of a clear association between PTSD and IBS may be due to a lack of research on the subject, or it may be due to the fact that PTSD and IBS have different underlying causes. While there is evidence that stress can exacerbate IBS symptoms, the underlying physiological causes of IBS and PTSD are not clearly related.

In summary, while there is no established link between PTSD and IBS, there is also no established lack of link between PTSD and IBS.","There is a strong association between PTSD and IBS. It is estimated that 40-50% of patients with PTSD have IBS like symptoms and 20-30% of patients with IBS have PTSD like symptoms. The exact nature of the association is not well understood. There are several theories including shared genetic causes, early life trauma and gut dysfunction. A good literature on this topic is (cite reference)"
"1. Yes, your sore throat could have been caused by the antibiotics. Antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria in your body. Sometimes, the good bacteria that help in digestion and immunity are killed leading to yeast infections, diarrhea, and abnormal gut flora. This in turn can affect the normal flora in your mouth leading to thrush infections of the mouth and throat.2. Yes, your diet could be causing your sore throat. Your diet should include zinc, vitamin C, and E. Zinc helps in healing ulcers. Zinc deficiency can cause a metallic taste in the mouth and a sore throat. A lack of vitamin C can cause an acidic taste in the mouth and a sore throat. Not having enough vitamin E can cause dryness in the throat and a sore throat.3. Yes, your sore throat could have been caused by your immune system. Your body has immune cells called lymphocytes that fight infections. These lymphocytes can destroy cells in your body if they are infected. If your lymphocytes are not functioning properly, you can get infections easily, and your sore throat could be a result of this.4. Yes, your sore throat could have been caused by dehydration. Dehydration occurs when your body loses too much fluid, and it affects almost all parts of your body. Dehydration can cause a sore throat due to the reduced fluid in your mouth.5. Yes, your sore throat could have been caused by your tongue. Your tongue has microbes that help in digestion. These microbes can cause infections if they are not balanced.

"No, a woman cannot catch pelvic inflammatory disease from a dirty toilet seat, such as in a campground or gas station. 

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. PID is typically caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, and can cause pelvic pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, and infertility if left untreated.

To contract PID, a person must come into direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, typically during sexual contact. The bacteria that cause PID cannot survive outside of the human body, so they are not transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, such as a toilet seat.

However, it is important to practice good hygiene when using public restrooms, especially if you have a sensitive or weakened immune system. Using hand sanitizer after using public restrooms can help reduce the risk of contracting a respiratory or hand-to-mouth infection.","No, this is not possible. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system that is acquired through sexual contact. The bacteria that cause PID, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, are transmitted through bodily fluids, such as semen, vaginal secretions, and menstrual blood. They cannot be acquired through contact with a dirty toilet seat or other surfaces, which do not contain these bodily fluids. 

It is important to practice good hygiene and to avoid contact with unsanitary surfaces, but this will not prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Safe sex practices, such as using condoms and practicing abstinence, can help reduce the risk of acquiring PID and other STIs. If you suspect that you may have PID or any other medical condition, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.","No, this is an urban legend. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It is caused by bacteria, usually those that also cause gonorrhea or chlamydia, which are transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person. The bacteria can enter the body through the vagina, anus, or cervix during sexual intercourse, foreplay, or an attempted tampon insertion. They can also be transmitted during childbirth or from a mother to her baby during delivery. 

Sitting on a toilet seat, even if it is dirty, is an unlikely way to contract PID because it does not allow for the kind of sexual contact that allows bacteria to enter the body. The idea that a toilet seat could transmit PID may have originated as an exaggeration of the way other diseases, such as the common cold, can be spread by touching doorknobs, light switches, and other public surfaces. However, PID is not one of these diseases.","No, a woman does not have any risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease from using a toilet seat that is dirty from campgrounds or gas stations. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that begins in the vulva or vagina and spreads upward to involve most of the structures in the female genital system. PID is almost always caused by ascending infection with gonococci or chlamydiae, two very common bacterial pathogens. The bacteria that cause PID can be transmitted only through sexual contact, and the bacteria that live on surfaces, such as a toilet seat, are not the same as those that cause PID. Therefore, there is no risk of a woman developing PID from using a dirty toilet seat. However, there are many other reasons to maintain good hygiene, including preventing the spread of disease and avoiding discomfort.","No, dirty toilet seats do not pose a risk of pelvic inflammatory disease to women. 

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system that is acquired during sexual activity. It is caused by bacteria, usually those that are normally found in the vagina, spreading from the vagina to other parts of the reproductive system, such as the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

To contract PID, bacteria must enter the body, which usually occurs during sexual intercourse. The bacteria can enter the body through the vagina, cervix, anus, or urethra. The toilet seat, including those at campgrounds or gas stations, is not a common route for bacteria to enter the body and cause PID. Additionally, proper hand washing can significantly decrease the likelihood of contracting PID. 

In summary, women do not contract PID from dirty toilet seats.","No, sitting on a dirty toilet seat, such as one at a campground or gas station, should not lead to a woman developing pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that begins in the vulva or vagina and spreads upward to involve most of the structures in the female genital system. PID is usually caused by microorganisms, particularly bacteria that ascend from the urethra and cervix, or from an intrauterine device (IUD). Theoretically, germs can be transferred to the vagina from the fecal-contaminated toilet seat, but PID develops only if they ascend to the reproductive tract and infect the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries. Therefore, sitting on a dirty toilet seat, such as one at a campground or gas station, should not lead to a woman developing pelvic inflammatory disease. However, it is advisable to wipe the seat with a paper towel before sitting."
"1) The white spots on your legs are likely due to vitiligo, which is a loss of pigmentation. It is due to destruction of the melanocytes, which are the cells responsible for skin color. The exact cause of vitiligo is not known, but it is thought to be related to autoimmunity (i.e. your immune system attacks the melanocytes). Treatment options include high-potency glucocorticoids (e.g. clobetasol), which you can apply topically, as well as various oral medications, such as hydroxychloroquine, which can be used in severe cases.
2) In addition, you likely also have a condition called ""ichthyosis,"" which is a general term used for a group of skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin. It is due to a genetic defect, which in your case seems to be more severe. Treatment options include the use of emollients (e.g. moisturizing creams and lotions), as well as low-potency topical steroids. In severe cases, retinoids (e.g. isotretinoin) may be prescribed.
3) Finally, it is important to protect your skin from the sun, as UV exposure can worsen both vitiligo and ichthyosis. This means using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding prolonged sun exposure.","1. Since you've been having sensitive skin since childhood, it is likely that your skin is sensitive. 
2. Sensitive skin is likely to develop conditions like dryness, eczema and allergies. 
3. Due to the sensitive nature of your skin, you must be very careful about what you apply on your skin. 
4. I would suggest you to first consult a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment. 
5. Creams will not help you, rather you need prescription medications to treat your skin conditions.","1. First, I'd recommend that you use a moisturizer throughout the day, particularly in the drier winter months. There are many good ones on the market, but I prefer those containing hyaluronic acid, such as the one I formulated, HYALU 30, available at http://www.SkinDoctor.com.
2. Next, I'd recommend you explore whether you have low levels of vitamin C, which can help improve skin tone and texture. I recommend a daily supplement containing 250 mg of vitamin C, as well as a vitamin C-based skin-care cream applied daily to affected areas. My vitamin C-based serum, C-Boost, is available at http://www.SkinDoctor.com.
3. To help conceal those white spots, I recommend you try a mineral-based concealer, such as Physicians' Option Instant Cover, available at http://www.SkinDoctor.com. Apply it in the morning after your moisturizer.
I hope this helps.","1. Since you have very sensitive skin, you have to be very careful about what you use.  I suggest you use a very good moisturizer in the morning, and at night, use a cream that has a little bit of hydroquinone in it (such as Exfoliating AHA Cream by Obagi, or Triple Action Cream by Dermalogica).  Hydroquinone is a bleaching agent that will gradually fade the white spots.  But since your skin is so sensitive, you have to start with a low concentration (such as 2%).  If it doesn't work or if it irritates your skin, see a dermatologist. 
2. In the morning, after you moisturize, apply a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 (such as Sunforgettable by Neutrogena).  Reapply every 2-3 hours.  If you stay out of the sun and keep your legs covered, the white spots will eventually go away. 
3. Exfoliate your legs every 3 days, using a scrub that contains alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or lactic acid (such as Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica).  This will help slough off the dead skin cells and reveal the living skin underneath, which will be lighter in color. 
4. Eat a healthy diet that includes citrus fruits (such as oranges and grapefruits), which are rich in vitamin C, an essential nutrient for healthy skin. 
5. Give your legs a rest.  If you're always showing them off, your skin will never have a chance to rest and repair itself.  Wear pants or long skirts sometimes. 
6. If you can afford it, get an ionotherapy treatment (such as the Obagi Blue Peel).  It will remove the top layer of skin (where the white spots are) and allow the younger, lighter-colored skin underneath to come to the surface.

Hi! I would recommend you to apply a sunscreen with SPF 50 over the affected areas of the legs twice daily. Also, use a moisturizer with vitamin C over the spots twice daily. You may also apply a brightening serum over the spots in the night. I would not recommend any concealers as they may irritate the skin in the long run. Regular sunscreen application along with use of vitamin C based products will help in improving the skin tone and fading of the white spots to a great extent.

"No, uveitis is not always autoimmune in nature. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye that includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, trauma, or autoimmune diseases. However, the most common cause of uveitis is actually idiopathic, meaning that there is no known cause for the inflammation. In these cases, the uveitis is considered sterile, meaning that there is no evidence of an infection or other underlying cause. Autoimmune diseases that can cause uveitis include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and others. If you are experiencing symptoms of uveitis, it is important to see an eye doctor or other healthcare provider for an evaluation and treatment.","Yes, uveitis is considered an autoimmune disease. Uveitis refers to inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye that includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis can be caused by infectious diseases, but it is most commonly caused by autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and others. The exact mechanism by which autoimmunity causes uveitis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a breakdown in immune tolerance, in which the immune system attacks and destroys the uvea due to a mistake in recognizing its own tissues.","Although the exact etiology of uveitis is unclear, it is  hypothesized that uveitis is either idiopathic, or it has an infectious, traumatic, or autoimmune cause. Furthermore, the most common etiologies for uveitis include infectious (40%–50%), non-infectious anterior segment inflammation (20%–30%), traumatic (10%–20%), and idiopathic (10%), followed by autoimmune etiology (5%), and pars planitis (5%).","yes, uveitis can be caused by an autoimmune reaction.","""Yes, uveitis is an autoimmune disease. Uveitis refers to inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye that includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis can be caused by infectious diseases, but the more common cause is autoimmunity. The underlying autoimmune disease varies and may be any of a number of different conditions. Common causes include autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as inflammatory conditions such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include topical or systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine or methotrexate, or biologic agents such as infliximab or etanercept. It is important to seek medical attention promptly for any symptoms of uveitis, as the condition can lead to complications such as glaucoma or vision loss if left untreated.""","While there are many types of uveitis, with varying etiologies, this category of diseases generally is described as autoimmune."
"❤️ I would first like to reassure you that this is a common problem, particularly after childbirth or during perimenopause. I would also like to point out that you do not need to take any drugs to stop this from happening as it is completely normal. However, if you would like to try and prevent it from happening then I would suggest that you look into nipple guards, which are designed specifically for this purpose. I hope this helps.","""I would recommend you to take some pills called 'Galactagogue'. They will gradually decrease your milk production. I would suggest you to take them for about 2 to 3 months.""

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","1. The first and foremost thing that you need to do is to avoid stress. Stress is the main cause of increase in prolactin hormone, which in turn increases the milk production. Try to relax as much as possible.
2. Another thing which you can do is to take a medication called as tamoxifen. It is a kind of chemotherapy medication which helps in reducing the milk production.
3. Apart from this, there are a few surgical procedures like gonadotrophin therapy and bilateral ovarian polycystic syndrome which can also be useful in reducing the milk production.
4. Above all, you need to have a proper discussion with your doctor regarding the whole issue, so that you can get a clear picture of what to do and what not to do.","There is no medication that has been shown to stop nipple discharge. However, certain medications can be tried in an attempt to reduce the discharge.

Regards",​The recommended drug to cease milk production in the breasts is Metoclopramide.,"Yes, a medication commonly known as ""domperidone"" can help stop the flow of breast milk. 

It is usually prescribed in tablet form, and must be prescribed by a doctor. It is not available over-the-counter. 

Domperidone works by blocking the action of a hormone called ""prolactin,"" which is responsible for stimulating milk production in the breasts. By blocking prolactin, domperidone can reduce or eliminate milk production, and in turn reduce or eliminate the flow of breast milk. 

It is important to note that domperidone should only be used under the guidance of a doctor, as it can have side effects and may not be appropriate for everyone. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with a qualified healthcare provider."
"1. The bacteria Serratia marcescens is a gram-negative bacillus that is commonly found in soil and water. It has been known to cause infections in humans, mostly in patients who are immunocompromised or have some other form of debilitation. These infections can be difficult to treat, and antibiotic resistance is a growing problem.
2. The recommended treatment for an infection of Serratia marcescens will depend on the severity of the infection, the location of the infection, and the overall health of the patient. In general, antibiotics that are effective against gram-negative organisms such as aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and carbapenems will be used. In addition, the source of the infection needs to be removed or covered with a dressing.
3. It is not clear why you are not getting improvement with gentamicin and other antibiotics. It is possible that the infection is resistant to these antibiotics, and another antibiotic with a different mechanism of action needs to be used. It is also possible that the infection is extensive, the patient is immunocompromised, or the source of the infection has not been removed. I suggest that you talk with your doctor about these issues to make sure that everything possible is being done to treat your infection.","1. The recommended treatment for a leg wound infected with Serratia marcescens bacteria that doesn't heal and has abscesses, inflammation, and pus, especially after gentamicin and other antibiotics have been applied without improvement, is surgical debridement.
2. Serratia marcescens is a type of bacteria that can cause difficult-to-treat infections, including in the legs.
3. If the wound doesn't heal and has abscesses, inflammation, and pus after multiple rounds of antibiotics, the infected tissue must be surgically removed.
4. Surgical debridement involves surgically removing the dead or infected tissue, as well as any foreign material or debris that may be impeding healing.
5. After surgical debridement, the wound must be closely monitored and treated with antibiotics as needed to prevent further infection.
6. In addition to surgical debridement and antibiotics, other treatments such as wound dressings or hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be helpful in promoting healing and preventing infection.
7. The prognosis for a leg wound with Serratia marcescens infection that has not responded to multiple rounds of antibiotics is good with prompt surgical intervention.","1. The first thing that I would do is to get a culture of the wound. The current antibiotic that you are using might be working but since it is a slow growing organism it might be masking the real picture. Once you have the culture report, you can start an antibiotic that would specifically target the bug.

2. The other thing that I would do is to make sure that the patient is not immunocompromised in any way. Since this is a polymorphic and fast growing bug once it gets into the blood stream it might cause serious problems. So I would suggest getting a complete blood count done for the patient.

3. Also, this is a type of an opportunistic pathogen and is known to cause infections in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or have some form of immunosuppression. So, I would also like to know if the patient is diabetic or is on some form of steroids.

4. This is a challenging organism to treat and if the wound is not healing then you might have to look for a surgical option. Sometimes it might become necessary to cut off the infected portion of the limb.","1. The patient should be told that this is an aggressive bacteria and may require a combination of agents to treat.

2. If the wound is still present, it should be evaluated to determine if it needs surgical intervention to debride any necrotic or non-viable tissue.

3. The current antibiotic regimen should be stopped, and a regimen of Intramuscular (IM) Penicillin G, 3-4 million units, 3 times a day and an antibiotic that has Serratia marcescens coverage should be started IV. An example of a serratia marcescens coverage antibiotic would be a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. 

4. The patient should be told that this is an aggressive bacteria and may require a combination of agents to treat.

5. If the wound is still present, it should be evaluated to determine if it needs surgical intervention to debride any necrotic or non-viable tissue.","1. A history of chronic leg wound with serratia infection, accompanied by abscesses and inflammation.
2. Antibiotics like gentamicin have been tried, but they haven't worked.
3. Suggest treatment or medication that would help.

Answer: The recommended treatment for Serratia marcescens infection is penicillin. However, since the bacteria have become resistant to penicillin, other options include clindamycin or a fluoroquinolone like ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. It is important to note that the antibiotic choice will depend on the geographical location since the bacteria have developed extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in some regions.","1. The patient should be transferred to a hospital.

2. The wound should be thoroughly cleaned out.

3. Vancomycin and clindamycin should be added to the treatment.

4. Surgical debridement and drainage may be necessary.

5. The patient should receive immunoglobulin and antitoxin.

Context: Serratia marcescens is a type of bacteria that can cause difficult-to-treat infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems. If you have a wound that is infected with Serratia marcescens and isn't responding to standard antibiotics, it's important to seek medical attention right away. In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of antibiotics, debridement, and surgery. It's also important to address any underlying medical conditions that may have contributed to the infection."
"It is great that you are doing a research report on SIDS. Unfortunately, I think you have the wrong idea about crib deaths. SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) is the unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant that remains unexplained even after a thorough autopsy or review of the scene. It is rarely related to cribs. Most crib deaths are accidental, and related to the fact that infants can get their head stuck in the space between the mattress and the crib railing, or between the crib railings and the mattress pad. If you are interested in SIDS, I would suggest you look at SIDS research, such as the Back to Sleep campaign. SIDS has been decreased dramatically since the Back to Sleep campaign began. If you are interested in crib death, you should look at crib safety. The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued crib safety guidelines. Cribs that are recalled can be found at the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

I would be happy to answer more questions as you do your research. You can also ask your question on the Chat Doctor forum, and get answers from others as well. 

Good luck with your report!","1) Should parents be concerned about crib death?
The answer is yes. Although the occurrence of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) is relatively low, it is the leading cause of death in infants aged 1 month to 1 year and is more common in males and in minority ethnic groups. The precise cause of SIDS is not known, but there are several risk factors that have been identified, and parents can take measures to reduce the risk of SIDS. These measures include placing infants on their back to sleep (the ""back to sleep"" campaign), avoiding overheating, not smoking during pregnancy, using a firm sleep surface, and breastfeeding.
2) Can you provide some resources for more information on SIDS?
Yes. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a Web site with information on SIDS (see below for URL). In addition, the following organizations may have useful information:
- National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
- Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
- SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
- Health Topics: S
- MedlinePlus: Infant and Newborn Health
- Too Many Crib Deaths: SIDS a Preventable Tragedy (Consumer Reports)

3) Would you be willing to be interviewed about SIDS?
Yes.","1. Are you afraid of crib death (SIDS)?
Answer: It is normal for parents to be concerned about SIDS. It is the most common cause of death in infants between 1 month and 1 year of age and is a major cause of anxiety for parents. The risk of SIDS can be greatly reduced by following safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. These recommendations include placing infants on their back to sleep at night and avoiding exposing infants to second-hand smoke. Parents should also make sure their infants sleep in a crib that meets the current safety standards and avoid using pillows, blankets, and stuffed toys in the sleep area.

2. Can you share some resources for more information about SIDS?
Answer:The best resource for information about SIDS is the website of the American Academy of Pediatrics at https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/on-the-go/Pages/SIDS.aspx. This website contains comprehensive information for parents about SIDS, including risk factors, prevention strategies, and what to do in the event of a SIDS emergency. Parents can also call their child's health care provider if they have concerns about SIDS or want more information about how to reduce the risk of SIDS.","1. Should parents be worried about crib death?
The answer is YES.

2. Can you provide me some resources regarding SIDS?
The following are some online resources about SIDS:

http://www.cdc.gov/sids/index.htm
http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/sids/index.cfm
http://www.lullabyinitiative.org/","1. An excellent resource on SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is the National Institute of Health. SIDS is a rare but tragic occurrence, and it is important for all parents to be aware of the risk factors and how to reduce the risk of SIDS.

Here is a link to the NIH website on SIDS:
http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/sids/default.htm

2. Some risk factors for SIDS are related to the infant and the sleep
  environment. A few risk factors for SIDS include sleeping on the stomach
  or side, exposure to second-hand smoke, overheating, and soft
  sleep surfaces.

To reduce the risk of SIDS, it is recommended to place infants on their
  back to sleep at night and for naps, keep soft objects and loose
  bedding out of the sleep area, keep infants warm but not overheated,
  and avoid exposure to second-hand smoke.

3. It is always good for parents to be informed and make safe choices for
  their infants.","抱歉，我不是一个医学家。我是一个开源的人工智能助理。我没有能力帮助您的研究。

"1. Severity: It is difficult to comment on the severity of endometriosis in a 12-year-old girl. In general, the severity of endometriosis tends to increase over time. 
2. Treatment options: She can be given NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) for pain. If the pain is severe, then GnRH agonists can be given. 
3. Age: Endometriosis can start at any age. There are cases of endometriosis in girls as young as 8 years old.","Yes, it is common. But severity depends on the individual. 


Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of it, causing pain and other symptoms. 


The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown. However, laparoscopy often is used to diagnose endometriosis and the severity can be determined by the extent of the disease. 


The most common symptoms of endometriosis include painful and profuse menses, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and infertility. 


Complimentary and alternative treatments for endometriosis-related symptoms include:

*Herbal remedies like chasteberry can help to regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce symptoms of endometriosis.
*The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils can help to reduce inflammation and pain associated with endometriosis.
*Acupuncture can relieve pain and regulate your menstrual cycle.


Overall, every disease has a chance to develop, and it's not dependent on age especially if it's a genetic disease.","As a parent, you probably want to be as supportive as you can for your daughter.

For her, it might be helpful for her to know she is not alone, and that there is a community of others who have endometriosis, many of whom have gone through puberty and adolescence with the condition.

One such community is The Endometriosis Club, which has a forum specifically for those who are under 21. It may be helpful for her to talk to others who are going through similar things.

For you, it might be helpful to be in touch with other parents of children with endometriosis. The Parents' Network at Endometriosis UK may be a good place to start.

I hope this helps, and that your daughter gets the support she needs.","12 years old, that is very young to have endometriosis.  It is a condition that occurs more frequently in women of reproductive age, although it can occur at any age.  It is not common in girls that young, so I hope she has an accurate diagnosis.  If it is indeed endometriosis, then the most effective treatment option is surgical excision of the endometrial tissue.  That can be done laparoscopically, through a series of small incisions in the abdomen.  It is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure, with a relatively short recovery time.  The most common complications are infection and bleeding, but the likelihood of those can be greatly reduced by performing the surgery before she reaches puberty.  Afterwards, she can use over-the-counter pain medications as needed for pain management.","1. For the United States, the organization for endometriosis is called Endometriosis Association at www.endometriosisassn.org.  They have a listserve and a newsletter that may be helpful.  
2. For online support, I would recommend http://www.endometriosisforums.com and http://www.endoftheicons.com/forums/.  These are good places to get support and information from other women and parents who are dealing with endometriosis.
3. I would also recommend a book called ""Curing Endometriosis"" by Dr. Robert L. Kasch, which describes a natural approach to treating endometriosis.  You can find out more information about this book at www.endocure.com.  This book has helped many women and girls with endometriosis.
4. I would also recommend seeing a naturopathic doctor or holistic obstetrician/gynecologist in your area to get additional support and guidance.  A woman named Connie M. Domino has written a book called ""The Endometriosis Diet"" which describes how foods can affect the condition.  You may find this helpful as well.
5. In terms of severity, endometriosis can range from mild to severe, depending upon the extent of the endometrial tissue outside of the uterus.  The main symptom of endometriosis is severe menstrual pain, as well as pain during sex.  Other symptoms can include fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, and mood changes.  It is important to seek medical attention if any of these symptoms occur.  I hope this helps. Good luck!","13 years old is very young to have endometriosis. Do you know for sure it is endometriosis?  There are other conditions to consider.  I am not an expert in pediatric gynecology, but I think there are surgical options, and possibly hormonal treatment.  I am not sure about clinical trials for pediatric patients, but there are for adults.  You should ask your doctor about what options are best for her."

Yes, in the states of California, Colorado, Hawaii, New York, and Oregon a person with less than six months to live can receive a prescription for life-ending medication if the patient requests it. The patient must be judged to have the capability to make the decision, which requires mental capacity as well as a number of other factors. In Oregon, the Death With Dignity Act specifically states that ""the patient has the capacity to make health care decisions"" and ""is capable of making and communicating health care decisions"" as criteria to receive a prescription.

In addition to these states, Washington, DC also has a Death With Dignity Act. However, it has not yet gone into effect due to Congressional action.","In the states of California, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, physician-assisted suicide is legal. 

Patient A has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, with a poor prognosis. She is in significant pain, and has been told that her condition is terminal. She has decided that she wants to die with dignity, rather than prolong her life in her current state. She asks her physician for medication that will assist her in dying. 

Is this legal? It depends on the state. In the states of California, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, physician-assisted suicide is legal. In these states, a mentally competent adult patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has less than six months to live, can request a prescription for medication that will end their life in dignity. The patient must administer the medication themselves. The physician's role is to provide the medication, and to confirm that the patient has made a voluntary, informed decision. 

It is important to note that in these states, physician-assisted suicide is still a controversial issue. There are strong opinions on both sides, and patients should discuss their end-of-life options with their physician and family members, as well."

Certain technologies that I have used personally include screen reading software, braille displays, and other devices such as magnifiers and optical magnifiers. I have not had any experience with stem cell surgery or bionic eyes but I do know that there are clinical trials being conducted for both of these treatments.  As far as gene therapy, I do not have personal experience but I do know that research in this area is ongoing.

Over the last few decades, great strides have been made in assistive technology for the visually impaired. Many devices that were once considered state of the art are now considered outdated. If you are looking for information on the latest and greatest technologies available, I would recommend doing some research on the following: screen reading software, braille displays, refreshable braille displays, optical magnifiers, and portable video magnifiers. You may also want to research devices designed for reading print such as book scanners and label readers. There are also devices designed to help with navigation such as canes and GPS systems.","As a researcher in the field of vision rehabilitation, I can tell you that there are many different ways that people with vision impairment / blindness are able to navigate their environment.

Some people use long canes and take large steps to navigate their environment. Some people use short canes and take small steps to navigate their environment. Some people use guide dogs and explore their environment by touch. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by sound. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by smell. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by heat differential. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by the magnetic fields created by electrical wiring. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by the raised edges of sidewalks and curbs. Some people use nothing and explore their environment by the placement of buildings and landscaping features.
Some people use low vision aids to maximize their remaining vision. Some people use magnifiers to enlarge images. Some people use CCTVs (closed circuit televisions) to camera zoom in on images. Some people use electronic book readers to read printed materials. Some people use screen reading software to read computer monitors. Some people use braille to read printed materials. Some people use large print materials to read printed materials.
Some people have surgery to repair problems with their eyes. Some people have surgery to remove cataracts from their eyes. Some people have surgery to replace damaged lenses in their eyes. Some people have surgery to repair problems with their optic nerves. Some people have surgery to replace damaged retinas in their eyes. Some people have surgery to repair problems with their eye muscles. Some people have surgery to replace damaged corneas in their eyes.

Explanation: An inhaler is a non-drug device that can be used to administer medication to the lungs in the form of a spray. It is often used to deliver short-acting beta-agonists, which can help to open up the airways and improve breathing in people with asthma. Inhalers are small and portable, making them easy to carry with you when you exercise, and they can be used quickly and discreetly before or during physical activity to help prevent or manage symptoms of exercise-induced asthma. Other types of medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, may also be used to help control asthma symptoms, and some people with exercise-induced asthma may find that nebulizers or other types of non-drug devices are more effective for them. It is important to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your asthma.","1. A dry powder inhaler such as albuterol can be used right before exercise.
2. A nebulizer can also be used in the same way.
3. A leukotriene antagonist taken orally 2 hours before exercise can be used to prevent symptoms.
4. Ipratropium bromide taken 30 minutes before exercise can be used to prevent symptoms.
5. A methyl xanthines inhibitor taken orally can be used to prevent symptoms.

These are all FDA-approved therapies for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and would be good options for managing symptoms.","1. No, a humidifier will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
2. Exhaling through a bronchodilator will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
3. A breathing mask does not qualify as a bronchodilator and therefore will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
4. While an air filter will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms, it can help reduce the amount of allergen and irritant particles in the air. This may be beneficial for individuals with allergies or sinusitis. 
5. A steam cleaner does not qualify as a bronchodilator and therefore will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
6. A cool mist therapy machine does not qualify as a bronchodilator and therefore will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
7. While a neti pot may help with symptoms of sinusitis, it will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 
8. A diffuser will not help with exercise-induced asthma symptoms.","Yes, an hand held peak flow meter can be helpful. A peak flow meter is a small hand-held device that measures how fast you can breathe out (your peak flow). It can be used to track your asthma symptoms over time and to predict when an asthma attack might happen. You can find these at most pharmacies.","1. A peak flow meter is a good device to track your asthma and know when to take your medicine.
2. A nebulizer is a machine that can act like an inhaler but deliver medicine through the air faster and deeper into your lungs.

4. If she is not on medicines which cause increased appetite and does not have dementia, try and feed her at one place.
5. If she is not on medicines which cause increased appetite, does not have dementia and you feed her at one place, the possibility of malnutrition is high. In that case, you need to hire a private nurse to feed her at regular intervals.","The caretakers have mentioned that she always seems to be hungry. When I visit her, she asks for food. What could be behind this behavior?

She is hungry!

It's obvious, but maybe not to her caretakers. I've seen this many times in my practice. Good thing to ask if she is eating and drinking well.","There are several reasons for this.

1. Malnutrition

Malnutrition is a common problem in care centers due to staff shortages, poor cooking facilities, and the inability of many elderly to eat well.
If this is the case, giving her nutritional supplements or a nutritious snack when you visit will help a lot.

2. Dehydration

Dehydration is a common problem in the elderly, and this can be worsened in care centers.
If this is the case, she will also feel thirsty and her urine may get dark. Give her plenty of water and tea when you visit.

3. Diabetes

High blood sugar in diabetes causes hunger due to the body's attempt to use insulin to get glucose from the blood for energy.
If this is the case, giving her a low glycemic index diet with plenty of protein and healthy fats will help reduce her hunger.

4. Infection

Infections can cause hunger in the elderly by causing a fever, which decreases appetite, and by interfering with absorption in the gut.
If this is the case, she may also have other symptoms like fatigue, pain, and feeling hot. Visit a doctor if this is the case.

5. Other Illnesses

Other illnesses can also cause hunger in the elderly by interfering with absorption in the gut or by causing fever.
If this is the case, she may also have other symptoms like fatigue, pain, and feeling hot. Visit a doctor if this is the case.

In conclusion, the hunger is likely caused by malnutrition or infection. Visiting doctors and giving her nutritional supplements when you visit will help a lot.","It could be a result of her medication.

There is a possibility that her constant hunger is a side effect of one of her medications. If this is the case, the medication may need to be adjusted or replaced. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor patients closely when prescribing medications to ensure the medications are effectively treating the condition while causing minimal negative side effects.

She may be bored.

Patients who are confined to care centers or who spend a great deal of time in bed may become bored and seek entertainment in the form of food. In this case, providing her with activities and entertainment may help curb her constant hunger. Activities such as reading, coloring, or listening to music could provide a distraction from her hunger pains.

She may suffer from depression.

Depression is a common problem among patients in care centers. Patients who suffer from depression may have a loss of appetite or overeat as a coping mechanism. In this case, it is important for healthcare providers to monitor patients closely for signs of depression and refer them to mental health professionals as necessary.

She may have an eating disorder.

Patients who have pre-existing eating disorders may find it difficult to control their urge to eat when in a care center. Care centers should have policies in place to help patients with eating disorders. For example, the care center may restrict the patient's access to food or require the patient to attend counseling sessions.","The elderly tend to be hungrier than people in other age groups.
Snacks are not usually offered or made available.
Meals are not always appealing.
Social contact is limited.
Depression is common.
Dementia is common.
Difficulty eating due to shaking, slowed swallowing, poor dentition.","There are multiple factors that can cause increased hunger in patients in care centers. These include:

Malnutrition: Many patients in care centers are malnourished, especially those who cannot feed themselves or have trouble swallowing. Your sister may be eating more in an attempt to compensate for this.

Boredom: Many patients in care centers experience boredom, which can lead to depression and anxiety. Eating is a common way to pass the time.

Lack of Exercise: Patients in care centers often have limited mobility and cannot exercise as much as they used to. This can lead to increased appetite.

Depression: Depression is common in care centers, and patients may eat more as a result.

Low Quality Food: The food at care centers may not be very tasty or satisfying. This can lead to patients eating more in an attempt to find something they like.

Suggestions:

Talk to her doctor: Her doctor will be able to identify if there is an underlying medical condition causing her increased hunger.

Improve the menu: Talk to the staff at the care center about improving the menu. Patients are more likely to eat food they enjoy.

Encourage exercise: Encourage your sister to exercise when possible. This can help reduce her appetite.

Talk to her: Lastly, talk to your sister about her increased hunger. She may be going through a difficult time and could benefit from someone to talk to.

Remember: It is important to identify the underlying cause of her increased hunger in order to provide appropriate care."

       Eighty percent of the men suffer from varicocele - enlargement of veins within the scrotum, causing discomfort or pain. Twenty percent of men have cryptorchidism - failure of the testicles to descend into the scrotum.
       In the course of evolution, humans developed the unique feature of an external scrotum. This was done to keep the testes at a constant temperature lower than the core body temperature in order to enhance the quality of sperms. When the testes are placed inside the body, as in other animals, they draw heat from the body and the quality of sperms is compromised. The external scrotum, the result of evolution, is covered with loose skin, which traps heat and raises the temperature of the testes. This is the reason why humans and their ancestors were restricted to colder climates.
2) Penis:
       The average penis is five inches long when erect and four inches when flaccid. The average weight of the penis is one pound. The average penile girth is three inches. The average width of the penis is half an inch. The average length of the foreskin is one inch.
       The erect penis has been the source of much controversy and misconceptions. The penis has three states - flaccid, erect, and flaccid again. The average time taken for erection is three minutes forty seconds. The temperature of the testes is lower than the core body temperature by a fraction of a degree.
       The penis has two sensitive areas - the frenulum and the ridge surrounding the glans. The frenulum is the small ridge of tissue on the underside of the penis that connects the foreskin to the glans. The ridge surrounding the glans is called the ridged band. The glans is the head of the penis which contains the urethra, the urinary canal, and the prostate gland.

It consists of a series of various organs which work together to permit the process of reproduction to occur. The male reproductive system is composed of the penis, the scrotum, testes, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicles, and the urethra. The testes are the primary sex organs responsible for the production of sperm and the male hormone testosterone. The testes produce around 1000 sperm per day, and the sperm travel through a tube called the epididymis, where they are stored and mature. The seminal vesicles produce a chemical that helps the sperm to survive in the female reproductive tract. The prostate adds a fluid to the sperm to create semen. The urethra allows the semen to exit the body during urination or sexual intercourse. The penis is the external portion of the male reproductive system. The scrotum is the pouch located outside the body in which the testes are held. The male reproductive system is an intricate system that is necessary for reproduction in humans."

- Limit your intake of sweets, refined carbohydrates, and fat.
- Exercise regularly and burn at least 500 calories every day.
- Keep a food diary to monitor your progress.
- Stay away from fad diets and extreme calorie restriction.
- Get plenty of sleep and manage stress.

Keep in mind that slow and steady weight loss is better and more sustainable than fast weight loss. It may take time and effort, but with determination and the right approach, you can achieve your goal.",The best diet to lose weight is the one you can stick to. Find something that you can live with for the long term and you will be successful.,"As a helpful doctor, I can certainly provide you with some general guidelines. However, I cannot recommend any specific diet as the best approach for weight loss because every individual has different nutritional needs and levels of physical activity. The best diet for weight loss is one that fits your individual needs and preferences while still allowing you to consume fewer calories than before, leading to a calorie deficit that results in weight loss over time.

Some general guidelines that can help you start developing a diet for weight loss include:

- Focus on nutrient-dense foods: Choose foods that provide significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients while still allowing you to reduce your calorie intake. Examples include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products.

- Control portions: Pay attention to the amount of food you eat, aiming to reduce your portions while still consuming enough calories to support your level of physical activity. Using smaller plates, bowls, and glasses can help trick your mind into eating smaller portions.

- Limit calorie-dense foods: Reduce your intake of foods that are high in calories but low in nutritional value, such as sugar, fat, and refined carbohydrates. These foods often have many calories but few other nutrients, allowing you to reduce your calorie intake while still feeling satisfied.

- Increase physical activity: Engage in regular physical activity, ideally at least 30 minutes per day, to burn calories and support weight loss.

Remember, the best diet for weight loss is one that you can stick to over the long term while still allowing you to lose weight gradually and safely. Consult with a healthcare professional such as a registered dietitian for additional guidance and support as needed.","1. The best diet for you is the one you can stick to.

"Hi,
It is possible for a female to get pregnant if she has sex on the first day of her menstrual cycle. This is because the egg is released on the first day of your menstrual cycle, and hence there is a possibility of conception. However, the chances of conception are highest on the 10th day of the menstrual cycle. 
Hence, the best time to try to conceive is on the 10th day of the menstrual cycle.
I hope this helps. Regards.","It is possible, although the chances of conception are slightly reduced since ovulation might not have occurred. 
A woman ovulates approximately mid-cycle, so a period of 3 days after ovulation would place the woman in her ""safe period"", when conception is not possible. 
However, since a woman's cycle can be irregular, it is possible that ovulation may have occurred early, in which case conception is possible.","It is possible, although the chances of pregnancy are very low. Sperm can survive for 3-4 days in the female reproductive tract, and if intercourse occurs during that time, pregnancy is possible. Also, ovulation may not have occurred yet, so fertilization may not be possible. However, it is best to use contraception regularly to avoid pregnancy.",1 in 5,"0 days after a period a girl can get pregnant, because ovulation occurs 14 days before the next period, so 3 days after a period would be too late.","No, a girl is not likely to become pregnant if she engages in sexual intercourse three days after the end of her menstrual period."
"As per your query, adding bleach in water and using it for cleaning would be effective in case of bed sores. However, it is not always the case that bleach is required for cleaning. Cleaning with only water and a rag would also suffice in most of the cases. The choice of cleaning agent depends on the severity of the bed sore and the patients skin type. In case of patients who have a darker skin tone, bleach is not preferred as it may not be that effective and may cause skin irritation in some cases. I would suggest you to consult a physician before using any cleaning agent for bed sores. Hope I have answered your query.

"Yes sepsis can be prevented and in fact in the US there is a movement to reduce hospital acquired sepsis. Sepsis is a serious complication that can occur after an infection. Good hand hygiene, vaccination, appropriate antibiotic use and early identification and treatment of infection can all reduce the risk of sepsis. In the hospital setting sepsis is often caused by a central line infection or a urinary tract infection. Preventive measures include using best practices for central line placement and maintenance as well as urinary catheterization (limitations and appropriate use).","Sepsis is a serious illness in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria. It is possible to prevent sepsis by not getting infections, or by treating infections quickly enough so that sepsis does not develop. Sepsis can be contracted in a hospital setting from an infected intravenous line or catheter, or if a wound becomes infected. Nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common causes of sepsis in hospital patients. To avoid sepsis, it is important to keep wounds clean and to watch for signs of infection, such as redness, pus, or pain. It is also important to make sure that catheters and intravenous lines are changed regularly and are kept clean.","Sepsis is a serious illness in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria. It can occur as a complication of any bacterial infection, including infections acquired in the hospital. Measures to prevent sepsis in the hospital include vigorous treatment of any infection, prompt identification and treatment of sepsis once it occurs, and good nursing care to prevent further infection. However, sepsis cannot always be avoided.",Sepsis can be avoided by preventing infections. It can be acquired in a hospital if proper hygiene is not maintained.,"Sepsis is a serious illness in which the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria. It is life-threatening, and needs to be treated right away.

Hospitals are hot spots for infections because patients are often sick and their immune systems are sometimes weak. But sepsis is not an infection itself. Rather, it's a serious illness that can occur as a complication of an infection.

Sepsis can be prevented by:

*getting needed medical care as soon as possible
*following your doctor's instructions about diagnosed infections

No. You can't get sepsis from being in a hospital. The bacteria that cause sepsis are everywhere. You can get sepsis from a scratch or cut, from bites or puncture wounds, and from infected medicines or prostheses. Doctors and nurses can get sepsis when they get an injury or a needle or dental procedure. Most often, sepsis is caused by bacteria called streptococcus, staphylococcus, or e. coli.","Preventive (prophylactic) antibiotics are recommended for patients with high risk of infection. In United States, the following patients are recommended to receive prophylactic antibiotics:

Patients with a history of NBS in the previous 12 months Patients with two or more NBS in the preceding 5 years Patients who have undergone NBS in the preceding 18 months

However, caution should be exercised while prescribing antibiotics and should be done on a case-by-case basis. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics may increase risk of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

Hospital-acquired sepsis is caused by bacteria that are acquired in the hospital during the course of treatment. It is a type of nosocomial infection. Patients with hospital-acquired sepsis usually have a long duration of hospital stay and usually have a central line in place. Hospital-acquired sepsis is more virulent and difficult to treat. Patients with hospital-acquired sepsis usually have a higher mortality rate."

The first step is to get an ophthalmologist or optometrist to determine whether the eyes are cross-eyed (strabismic) or the eyes are actually structurally crossed (stigmatic). 

2. If the eyes are determined to be strabismic, then the treatment is to first prescribe glasses or contact lenses to correct the vision problem. If the eyes still do not align properly with glasses or contact lenses, then surgery may be needed to reposition the eyes.

3. If the eyes are determined to be stigmatic, then surgery may be needed to reposition the eyes. Vision therapy may also be prescribed to improve the patient's binocular vision.","It is also known as ""strabismus"", and it can be caused by a number of factors including:
* uncoordinated eye movements
* problems with the muscles around the eyes
* damage to the nervous system
* problems with the eyes themselves

It is important to note that being cross-eyed is not always a sign of a serious problem. For example, it is common in young children before they are old enough to fully coordinate their eyes. It is also common in adults as a temporary condition caused by fatigue, stress, or other factors.

If the cross-eyed condition persists or worsens, however, it is important to see an eye doctor to determine the underlying cause. Treatment for being cross-eyed will depend on this cause. For example, glasses or contact lenses may be sufficient if the problem is caused by a problem with the eyes themselves. Surgery may be necessary if the problem is caused by muscle or nervous system damage.","3D glasses are effective for a while, but the problem is that they inhibit the development of normal binocular vision, which relies on the brain getting the appropriate messages that the eyes are looking at different distances. If the glasses are worn continuously, or for long periods of time, the risk of strabismus (squint) increases.
An ophthalmologist or orthoptist can determine whether therapy can correct the problem. If surgery is required, it's most effective when done before the child is 5 years old.","""To help with cross-eyed vision, patch the good eye, or penalize the use of the bad eye with a string or adhesive tape.""

This advice was given to a parent in 1935, whose child had amblyopia, a condition where the eyes do not work together properly. At the time, the most effective treatment for amblyopia was to patch the good eye, or penalize its use, so that the weak eye would be forced to work harder. With increased use, the weak eye would improve and begin to work better with the other eye. While this advice may seem outdated today, the concept remains the same. To correct cross-eyed vision, the weaker eye needs to be strengthened, and its use discouraged. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including patching, penalization, and vision therapy. Which method is used, depends on the patient's specific needs and circumstances."
"1.  The standard initial treatment for acute bronchitis is acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin.

If your symptoms get worse or you have a chronic cough, see your doctor to rule out asthma or other problems. Do not smoke. Get a yearly flu vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine as directed by your doctor. The doctor will recommend the best treatment according to the cause of the disease. 

3. Antibiotics are not recommended for the treatment of acute bronchitis. If you have a bacterial infection, the doctor will recommend antibiotics. If you have bronchitis and have a cough, it is important to know the cause.

4. Doctors may recommend medications such as bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, and humidifiers to relieve symptoms.

In this type of therapy, you will work with your therapist to identify and change negative behaviors and thoughts.  For example, if you are suffering from depression, your therapist may ask you to act as if you are not depressed even though you may not feel that way.  Over time, this behavior will begin to change your feelings and attitudes.

Headache prevention","1.  The first option is typically the most effective: Do nothing.

    Many conditions are self-limiting and will resolve on their own with minimal or no intervention.  An example of this is a common cold, which will normally run its course over a week to ten days with no specific treatment.  While it may be tempting to try to speed up the recovery process with over-the-counter medications or other treatments, the risks of such interventions are often greater than the benefits that might be achieved.

2.  The second option is to use over-the-counter medications.

    While these medications are available without a prescription, they still contain potentially harmful chemicals and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider.  Examples of such medications include acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, cough suppressants, expectorants, decongestants, and antihistamines.

"1. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and strength that normally occurs in elderly individuals.
2. It is a clinical syndrome of loss of muscle mass and muscle function with aging.
3. It is characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, and a concomitant decrease in functional ability.
4. The most common causes of sarcopenia include:

A. Decreased production of skeletal muscle
B. Increased breakdown of skeletal muscle
C. Decreased intake and/or absorption of nutrients
D. Decreased sensitivity to anabolic stimuli

5. Exercises such as aerobics, weightlifting, and resistance training can help to prevent sarcopenia.
6. It is important to talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise program.","I would recommend a supervised exercise program, and if the patient is tolerating liquids, water aerobics would be great.  A program like Tai Chi would also be great for balance, flexibility, and strength.  I would also recommend a diet rich in protein, and if the patient is tolerating supplements I would recommend a multivitamin, calcium, and an anti-oxidant.  Make sure to address any depression, as that can be a cause of fatigue as well.","Τhe most important thing is to start with a physical activity and then maintain it regularly. It is well known that even moderate intensity exercises can improve significantly muscle mass and strength in older adults. Resistance training is an effective intervention for muscle strength and muscle mass in older adults. It has been shown that muscle strength in men and women aged 50-83 years who performed resistance exercises 2 or 3 times a week increased by 11% and 19%, respectively. In addition, muscle mass increased by 7% and 12%, respectively. Other studies have shown that walking, cycling and aerobics can also contribute to muscle strength and muscle mass in older adults. In conclusion, it is never too late to start physical activity and other exercises that will contribute to muscle strength and muscle mass such as swimming and resistance exercises. The ideal timing for these activities is after a warm-up, such as a 10-15-minute walk.","82 years old! That is impressive. I commend you for your activity level and dedication to fitness. 

The best exercise to maintain strength is the exercise you will do. So if you are active and engaged in resistance training, you are on the right track. 

As people age, their muscles and body change. It is common to experience some level of fatigue and strength decline. I know this can be frustrating, but it is important to remember that your body is aging and not necessarily sick.  

To combat sarcopenia, it is important to stay active. I know you are already swimming, but adding low-impact cardio can help keep your heart healthy. It is also important to make sure you are eating enough protein to maintain muscle mass. 

As far as specific exercises go, it is important to do a little bit of everything. This means doing a combination of resistance training that works all the major muscle groups (legs, chest, back, shoulders, arms) as well as low-impact cardio. 

Specifically, you might consider adding exercises like:

Walking
Lightweight lifting (bicep curls, tricep extensions)
Chair Assists

I would also consider adding a supplement like collagen protein to your diet. Collagen is a type of protein that is easily absorbed and can help maintain and build muscle mass.  

It is important to remember that everyone is different. What works for one person might not work for another. I would consider speaking with a registered dietician or personal trainer to help create a customized plan that meets your individual needs. 

I hope this helps!","82 years old and swimming and resistance exercising daily - hats off to you, that's fantastic, and please keep it up, because you're already doing way more than most people your age!

As one gets older, it is true that one loses muscle mass, and this is compounded by the fact that one also loses strength. This is called sarcopenia. Factors that contribute to sarcopenia are:

Decreased testosterone levels
Decreased growth hormone levels
Decreased thyroid hormone levels
Decreased digestion and absorption of nutrients (especially protein)

Fortunately, there are things that can be done to minimize the effects of sarcopenia:

Keep exercising. As long as you are able, keep doing what you're doing. Exercise is key to slowing the effects of sarcopenia.
Get enough sleep. Sleep is when your body recovers and repairs itself. Without enough sleep, your body will not be able to recover as well, and you will not see the full benefits of your workouts.
Eat enough protein. Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle. It is best to get your protein from food rather than supplements.
Vitamin D3 supplementation. Low levels of Vitamin D3 have been shown to contribute to sarcopenia. Supplementing with Vitamin D3 can help improve muscle strength and size.
Creatine supplementation. Creatine is a natural substance that is found in animal protein, and has been shown to improve muscle strength and size.

As far as the timing of your workouts, it is best to work out when one has the most energy. For some people, that means working out in the morning. For others, it means working out in the evening. It all depends on your body and your schedule, so find what works best for you.

In summary, keep up the great work, and to minimize the effects of sarcopenia, get enough sleep, eat enough protein, supplement with Vitamin D3 and creatine, and exercise regularly.","I am not sure if I have understood your question correctly. But if you are struggling with maintaining strength because of fatigue, one of the main causes could be nutritional deficits. Make sure that you are eating enough protein (at least 1 gram per day for every kilo of body weight), enough calories (about 500 more than you burn every day), and enough micronutrients (especially vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin B12). 

Also, if you are not suffering from any medical conditions, you can try out supplements containing branched-chain amino acids and creatine monohydrate, which will help you with strength and fatigue. 

If you do not have a medical condition, you can also try out testosterone and growth hormone boosters, but make sure that you are being monitored by a doctor when doing so."

Multiple brain infarcts disease also known as MBD or MBI is a rare disease which affects the blood vessels in the brain causing them to become blocked or rupture leading to a stroke.  Treatment for the disease may include medications to thin the blood and prevent further blood clots, antiplatelet therapy to prevent clots from forming and surgery to remove clots that have already formed.  It is important for individuals with MBD to make lifestyle changes such as not smoking, exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy diet and to always take prescribed medications as directed.  It is also important for individuals with MBD to regularly visit a neurologist to monitor for signs of another stroke.  I hope this information was helpful and that it helps you discuss your treatment options with your doctor.

"66 years old, waking up frequently at night, cortisol levels  Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is secreted by the adrenal glands and is responsible for the fight or flight response.  It is also associated with waking up at night.  Adrenal gland hyperplasia, or hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands can cause this pattern.  I would suggest getting a thigh-level blood test to check your hemoglobin A1C level.  This will indicate whether or not you have diabetes.  If that is normal, then you should get an MRI of the pituitary and adrenal glands.  That will show whether or not there is an adenoma (tumor) in one of those glands.  If you find that all of your blood tests are normal, then you should try taking magnesium supplements and get some cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.  That should help improve your sleep.","9 AM is too early to take a sample of cortisol. The level should be higher at that time. A level of 5.1 is perfectly fine for 11:30 AM. The level of 4.2 at 4:30 PM is also fine. The level of 3.3 at 9:30 PM is marginally low. So, your 24-hour average cortisol is normal, which means your issue is not an adrenal problem. 
Although your tests are normal, it is possible that you have an issue with your sleep cycle. You should have that checked out. 
Sleep apnea and RLS (restless leg syndrome) can both interfere with sleep, as can a number of other conditions. 
If all of your other tests are normal then it is worth looking into whether you might have one of these other conditions. 
But it sounds like you are already doing that.","9 AM:  Cortisol at its peak levels. You probably are feeling fresh and active. Your digestive system is also at its best. You should have your breakfast now. Breakfast should be the most nutritious meal of the day.

Mid morning: Cortisol levels are coming down. You start feeling the need for a nap. But you shouldn't sleep at this time as it may ruin your sleep at night. Instead, you can do some light exercises, listen to some upbeat music or do some entertaining reading.

Late afternoon: Cortisol levels are again on the rise. You should have your lunch now. Avoid hefty food. Have some light food. You should take some rest after lunch. A short nap of around 20 minutes should do you good.

Evening: Cortisol levels are at their lowest. You should have your dinner now. Avoid non-veg and heavy food. You should go to bed soon after dinner. You should avoid watching TV or using computer or mobile at night.","9 am cortisol of 5.1 seems a bit high to me. The range of normal is about 4-20 µg/dL. Your number suggests a 24-hour cortisol excretion of about 65-350µg, which falls within the reference range of 50-230 µg/dL, but is at the higher end of the range.
Cortisol has an afternoon peak, so the noon value is more diagnostic. A value of 4.2 suggests an afternoon peak of about 15 µg/dL, which is near the upper end of the normal range, which is about 10-50 µg/dL.
These values suggest to me that you probably have a diagnosis of hypercortisolism, which can be due to a number of causes. The two most common are Cushing's disease, due to an adrenal tumor, and iatrogenic hypercortisolism due to replacement therapy.
I would recommend that you find a specialist in endocrinology to help you further with this problem.","9 AM: waking up 5.1 is quite high. You are already in the alert phase. If you have trouble falling asleep again in the evening this is most likely due to the light (you should decrease it) and stimulating activities in the evening (you should avoid). Instead, you could take a nap in the early afternoon (but not for more than 30 minutes).11 AM: 4.2 is high too. You should avoid stimulating activities, avoid caffeine after lunch and do some relaxing activities. 3.3 in the evening: that's the best time to take a nap (if you need it). You should also avoid stimulating activities, avoid caffeine after lunch and do some relaxing activities. Night saliva test: you should turn off the light in your bedroom early (at least 2 hours before bedtime). You should not watch TV or use your computer in the bedroom either. You should not eat a heavy meal 2 hours before bedtime and avoid alcohol and caffeine after lunch. You should not exercise in the evening either. You should try to relax before going to bed (for example by reading not stimulating books). You should wake up at the same time every day (even on the weekends).","9 at 6:30am, 5.1 at 11:30am, 4.2 at 4:30pm, and 3.3 at 9:30pm
In short, your cortisol levels are fine. The values are actually really good. Cortisol levels above 5 are only seen in people with major depressive disorders. Your night time cortisol levels are a little low, but that is to be expected. Your body stops producing cortisol several hours after you fall asleep. The low night time cortisol is probably the cause of your waking up frequently during the night. You should try to improve your sleep hygiene. Diminish the light in your bedroom a few hours before you go to sleep. Don't bring your phone or turn on the TV in bed. Try to establish a routine before going to bed so that your body gets conditioned to sleep at a certain time. The more stimulating your activities before bed, the more difficult it is to fall asleep. Listening to soft and calming music can help condition your body to sleep. 
Your daytime levels are perfectly fine. Again, these are the levels seen in people without depression. The values are actually so low that many doctors will prescribe steroids to patients with values that low. You have plenty of energy during the day. 
P.S. - I'm a doctor, but I'm not your doctor. The information I provided is what I feel is correct, but it may not be applicable to your specific situation. Please consult your doctor for specific treatment recommendations."
The  ChatDoctor.,"1.  The first step is to make sure she is well HY Chat Doctor.   This can be done by giving her oral supplements of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D3 and boron.  Make sure she is getting enough calcium in her diet. Calcium can greatly decrease muscle cramps. Calcium can interfere with the absorption of iron from non-heme sources such as plant based iron supplements or multivitamins.  If she is taking an iron supplement or multivitamin, take that at the opposite end of the day as the calcium supplement.  
2.  Secondly, make sure she is well HY","1.  Increase salt intake, but be careful not to increase protein intake, as protein can be converted to purines, which increase uric acid levels.
2.  Be sure she is getting enough calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D.
3.  Exercise regularly, which helps with circulation.
4.  Avoid long periods of inactivity, such as long plane or car rides.
5.  Massage her calves and feet.","20 mEq (milliequivalents) per day is a very low dose of potassium. The typical dose of potassium for treatment of muscle cramps is 600 mg to 1,200 mg, or 6-12 mEq. This is the amount of potassium contained in a half of a banana. It would be important to know why your wife is on such a low dose of potassium. Is she having muscle cramps because of low potassium levels? If so, the muscle cramps would only be relieved by giving her more potassium, which can be done with a banana, or a potassium supplement such as a banana-flavored powder mixed in water. If low potassium levels are not the cause of her muscle cramps, there are other possible causes that would need to be investigated. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","1.  Magnesium supplementation- magnesium is an ion channel blocker and adequate magnesium supplementation can reduce the frequency and severity of leg cramps2.  Vitamin D supplementation- there is a relationship between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of leg cramps. 3.  Hydration- make sure she is hydrated properly. If in doubt, have her get her blood tests for kidney function and electrolytes.",2 things come to mind - 1) make sure she is well HY Chat Doctor.  Low hemoglobin will make the leg cramps worse. Anemia is common in patients with systemic lupus. The second thing is magnesium supplementation. Most people are deficient in magnesium. A good multivitamin/mineral supplement will probably help but a targeted magnesium supplement would probably help more. There are several types of magnesium - this study used magnesium oxide - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397727 - I could not find the brand that was used but I did find this - http://www.jigsawhealth.com/magnesium-supplements-types-differences-uses-benefits-and-side-effects/ - it's pretty pricey but very absorbed (300-400mg elemental magnesium) Good Luck and God Bless

"10 years is a long time to live with any medical condition, especially one as debilitating as necrotizing fascitis. The initial surgical treatment of necrotizing fascitis is extensive debridement and removal of necrotic/dying tissue. This is likely the surgery that your doctors recommended 10 years ago, and likely the reason they refused was because it is a very extensive surgery requiring general anesthesia, multiple surgeons and nurses, not to mention extensive time in the operating room. Antibiotics at the time were the standard of care, however with the emergence of more potent and targeted antibiotics in the last 10 years, the surgical approach has changed. The current surgical management of necrotizing fasciitis is aggressive debridement and antibiotic therapy. If left untreated, necrotizing fasciitis will continue to spread and devour healthy tissue. I would highly recommend going to the emergency room or your local hospital and explaining to them your situation. They will be able to help you and guide you in the right direction.","10 years is a long time to go without treatment, especially for a condition like CS which can cause progressive disability. I am very surprised that you did not qualify for any state assistance or charitable assistance in that time.  You may want to try contacting the national library of medicine, which has a charitable program to assist those who cannot afford treatment. You can find out more at https://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/request_services.html.  Good luck to you.","1. You can try searching for clinical trials on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.  It may be possible to get surgery at no cost to you if you join a clinical trial.
2. You can try contacting a charity in your country to see if they offer funding for surgery.  For example, The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons has a charity that may be able to help you called Fight Colorectal Cancer.  You can search online for charities in your country that may be able to help.
3. You can try crowdfunding.  This is where you tell your story online and people donate money to help you.  You might be able to raise enough money this way to pay for surgery.  Examples of crowdfunding websites are GoFundMe and YouCaring.  These websites are free to use.
I hope this information helps.  Best of luck to you.","10 years is a long time to live with any medical condition, especially one as debilitating as NCS. I am sorry to hear that your symptoms have intensified over time.

Sadly, without understanding more details of your case, I can only offer advice on seeking out support. My best advice is to reach out to your local neurological society or association. They may be able to provide you with resources, or even financial aid to help you afford the surgery.

Additionally, many hospitals have some sort of financial aid or charity program to help those who cannot afford medical care. While they may not be able to provide you with support for this specific condition, they may be able to help you with other medical issues that may have arisen over the years.

Neuromyotonia is an abnormality of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness, stiffness, and irritability, frequently in the arms, legs, and face. Spontaneous electrical activity in muscles causes the muscle contractions that are a hallmark of this disorder. This abnormal electrical activity usually occurs intermittently.

Treatment:

Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and improve mobility
Medications to control muscle contractions and improve muscle weakness
Anti-arrhythmic medications to control abnormal electrical activity in the heart
Supplements to counteract potassium deficiency caused by the condition
Surgery in severe cases

If you are interested in seeking treatment, I would recommend that you see a neurologist.  They can prescribe the proper medications and treatment to help alleviate your symptoms.  I hope that I have answered your query.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions.  I would be happy to help you in any way I can."
"Pressure sores (also called bedsores or decubitus ulcers) are injuries to skin and underlying tissue that occur when pressure is applied to the skin for a long time. They most commonly occur on the back or bottom of people who are bedridden or have trouble moving on their own. The pressure restricts blood flow to the affected area, and the affected tissue dies. Pressure sores are staged according to their severity (see chart below).

Skin grafting is a treatment option for patients with severe pressure sores. A skin graft is a piece of healthy donor skin that is moved from one part of the body to another part to cover a wound. There are two ways to do a skin graft: local flaps and full-thickness grafts. In both types, the surgeon uses stitches to close the area and keep the new skin in place.

However, not all pressure sores require a skin graft. Treatment depends on the severity of the pressure sore, and can range from simple changes in position to surgery. The goal of treatment is to relieve pressure on the affected area, stop any infection, and promote healing.

In summary, skin grafting may be an option to treat severe pressure sores in elderly patients, but treatment depends on the severity of the pressure sore and can range from simple changes in position to surgery.","1. A skin graft is not effective in treating a stage 4 pressure sore in an elderly person.

2. No, a skin graft is not a less invasive option. In fact, it's one of the most invasive treatments for pressure sores.

3. Other treatments, such as debridement (removing damaged tissue) and wound dressings, are more commonly used to treat pressure sores.

4. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases of stage 4 pressure sores. Other options, like pain management and physical therapy, may also be used to reduce pain and promote healing.","Surgical intervention is not indicated in the management of pressure ulcers. However, if the ulcer is severe (e.g. stage 4) and not responding to non-surgical interventions, debridement of necrotic and fibrotic tissue might be required. This is a surgical procedure where the dead tissue is removed from the wound to help heal the ulcer.

A skin graph may be used as an adjunctive to surgery in the management of severe pressure ulcers (e.g. stage 4) in the elderly. A skin graph is a cultured epithelial autograft (cultured skin) which is used to cover wounds and help them heal faster.  

Skin graphs have been found to be beneficial in healing severe pressure ulcers in the elderly. They help reduce the wound size, prevent further infection, reduce the risk of complications such as infection and contractures, improve the cosmetic appearance of the wound and improve the patient's quality of life.

However, a skin graph is not a less invasive approach than surgery. It is still a surgical procedure where healthy skin is harvested from one area of the body and grafted over the wound. The decision to use a skin graph should be made by the treating physician based on the severity of the pressure ulcer and the patient's overall health status.","A skin graft is an option, but it might not be the best one. It's very invasive and there's a high risk of infection. The wound would take a long time to heal, maybe months. The patient would need to be immobile during that time, which could cause other health problems.

There are other options that might be better. One would be to use a robotic debridement machine to clean out the wound regularly. This would take less time than a human would need, and would be less painful. Another option would be to use a mesh patch to cover the wound and let it heal on its own. Antibiotics could be used to fight infection.

Overall, a skin graft should only be used as a last resort after other options have been tried and found wanting.","4

Regenerative medicine is a quickly evolving field with new discoveries regularly. While these 10 questions and answers may soon become outdated, the fundamental principles of regenerative medicine will continue to be an important aspect of the medical field.","As a helpful doctor, I can understand your concern regarding the treatment of stage 4 pressure sore in an elderly person. But, we must keep in mind that every treatment has its own advantages and disadvantages. A skin graph is a relatively less invasive treatment procedure as compared to other surgical interventions for pressure sores. It is painless, leaves minimal scarring and has faster healing rate. However, it is an expensive procedure and is usually not covered by the insurance companies. Moreover, there is a risk of developing infection at the site of grafting. Therefore, it is essential to discuss the pros and cons of this treatment with the patient and the family members before proceeding with it. Hope this information helps. Best wishes."

NEVER ASSUME WHAT YOUR PAIN IS OR WHAT IT MEANS WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH A QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.  MSK pain can be due to a variety of causes - muscle strain, ligament/tendon sprain/tear, bone fractures, arthritis, etc.  Treatment for MSK pain depends on the underlying cause and can include rest, ice/heat, physical therapy, NSAIDs/acetaminophen, local injections of corticosteroids/anesthetic, and in severe cases surgery.

Prop yourself up on pillows to prevent spine from curving too much.  Try to keep your spine in a more neutral position at all times, even when sleeping.
2.  Avoid sudden jerky movements, because they can stress your spine and surrounding tissues.  Try to make movements smooth and gradual.  Avoid heavy lifting and pushing, because they can stress your back.  Ask for help if an object is too heavy for you to handle safely.
3.  Walking uphill and walking downhill place different stresses on your spine and surrounding tissues.  If you have already been injured, walking downhill will usually be more painful, because it stretches your spine in directions that are already damaged and inflamed.  If you have not been injured, walking downhill is probably the more beneficial exercise because it stretches your spine in all directions, including directions that may be tight or weak.
4.  Exercise your spine regularly in positions that are not curved too much, because a curved spine is usually a strained spine.  Exercise your spine in positions that are not twisted too much, because a twisted spine is also usually a strained spine.  Exercise your spine in positions that gently stretch and mobilize your spine in all directions.  This will help keep your spine healthy and strong, and reduce your risk of injury.  It will also help speed your recovery if you have already been injured.
5.  Spend at least as much time exercising your spine as you do sitting in a chair or lying down.  Most people spend too much time sitting down and not enough time exercising their spines.  This is a significant factor in the high incidence of spinal injuries.  Try to maintain a reasonable balance between sitting, lying down, and exercising your spine."

The treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The doctor may also recommend a combination of therapies depending on the stage and grade of the tumor. The treatment options are discussed in detail in the following sections.

Surgery: Surgery is the most common treatment for prostate cancer. The most common surgery performed is radical retropubic prostatectomy. Another surgery performed is radical perineal prostatectomy. In this surgery, the prostate is removed through the perineum. This surgery is usually preferred for patients with more advanced prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy is performed for localized prostate cancer. 
Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is another treatment option for prostate cancer. External beam radiation therapy is the most common type of radiation therapy performed. Brachytherapy is another type of radiation therapy performed for prostate cancer. 
Hormonal therapy: Hormonal therapy is used to block the effects of testosterone on the prostate cancer cells. The hormonal therapy is used along with radiation therapy in certain cases. 
Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is usually not the first treatment chosen for prostate cancer. Chemotherapy is used in combination with other treatments like radiation therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. 
Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is a newer type of treatment for prostate cancer. Immunotherapy helps the body's immune system to fight cancer."
"As per your question, these two diseases are similar in symptoms.
  Osteogenesis Imperfecta: It is a disease that affects the bones. People
  with Osteogenesis Imperfecta have bones that are brittle and prone to
  fracture. Even normal activities like walking, running and jumping can
  cause bone fractures.

EDS: It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue,
  which provides the framework and support for the body. There are
  several different types of EDS. People with EDS are at an increased
  risk of having joint dislocations, skin that is overly stretchy, and
  easy bruising and bleeding.

I don't have any specific laboratory in mind, but you can contact the
  University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Genetic Testing
  Laboratory. Their website is: www.gnl.ucla.edu. You can explore the
  option of genetic testing with your doctor.

Hope this helps!","As per my knowledge there is no genetic testing available for Osteogenesis Imperfecta. But there are some clinical tests which help in diagnosing it.

Suffering from multiple fractures in childhood.
Easy bruising and bleeding.
Connective tissue abnormality.

On the other hand, genetic testing for EDS is possible.

A skin biopsy is taken from the patient and a genetic test called COL4A5 and COL4A6 is done to look for mutations in the genes.

Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.","As a doctor, I can tell you that the symptoms of these two diseases do overlap. Both genetic disorders, EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) and Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or ""OI"" affect the body's connective tissues. 

In EDS, faulty collagen protein causes joint instability, which can lead to chronic joint damage and dislocation. In severe cases, EDS patients may be unable to walk. Patients with OI, on the other hand, have bones that are fragile and break easily. Depending on the severity, patients may experience hearing loss due to collapsed bones in the middle ear, as well as other symptoms such as blue sclerae and dental problems.

Both diseases are genetic and can be diagnosed with genetic testing. Treatment for EDS may include physical therapy to strengthen muscles and surgery to repair or replace damaged joints. Treatment for OI may include physical therapy, calcium and other supplements to strengthen bones, and surgery to correct skeletal abnormalities. 

I would recommend that you visit the website for the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, which provides information on hundreds of rare diseases, including EDS and OI. You may also want to talk with your doctor about local laboratories that offer genetic testing.","As far as I know, there are no specific laboratory in Southern California that specializes in genetic testing for EDS and Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

The symptoms of EDS and Osteogenesis Imperfecta are different from each other. EDS is a heterogeneous condition with many different types, each with its own characteristic features. It is characterized by joint hypermobility and connective tissue abnormalities. Patients usually have a positive history of joint dislocations and muscle weakness.

Osteogenesis Imperfecta, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder that affects the bones. Patients have a positive history of fractures, even in childhood. Other symptoms include bone pain, muscle weakness, blue sclerae, hearing loss, and dental problems.

In conclusion, although there are some laboratories that offer genetic testing for these two conditions, I recommend consulting with a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.","1.	I’m afraid I can’t help with testing, but I can provide information on the conditions.

2.	Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that affects collagen, which is a protein necessary for healthy bones. There are different types of OI, ranging from mild to severe. People with OI can experience fractures, as well as other symptoms like hearing loss or blue sclerae.

3.	On the other hand, EDS is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body’s connective tissue, which provides support and structure to the body. EDS can cause symptoms such as easy bruising and bleeding, as well as other symptoms depending on the type of EDS.

4.	The symptoms of these two diseases are certainly comparable. In fact, some people with OI are initially diagnosed with EDS because of the similarities in symptoms.

5.	I’m sorry I can’t provide a laboratory, but perhaps someone else can help you with that. I hope this information was helpful. Best wishes!","I can highly recommend a lab for genetic testing for EDS and Osteogenesis Imperfecta, but I need to know your location so that I can recommend a lab that is close to you. 

As for the similarity of symptoms between EDS and Osteogenesis Imperfecta, they are both genetic connective tissue disorders, but they have many differences in terms of symptoms and severity. 

Here is a list of some of the differences:

- Osteogenesis Imperfecta is caused by a mutation in the genes for type I collagen, while EDS is caused by a variety of mutations in collagen and other proteins.

- EDS can have many different symptoms, but it generally does not cause bone abnormalities. Osteogenesis Imperfecta does cause bone abnormalities.

- EDS is associated with joint instability and recurrent joint dislocations, while Osteogenesis Imperfecta is not.

- People with EDS are more prone to having organ defects and hernias, while people with Osteogenesis Imperfecta do not have these problems.

It is clear that while these two diseases are both genetic, they are very different in terms of symptoms and severity. Therefore, it is important to get an accurate diagnosis so that you can receive the proper treatment."
"1. Your description is not consistent with having worms coming out of your nose and eyes. Having conjunctivitis (redness and discharge from the eyes) does not indicate an internal worm infestation. There are many causes of conjunctivitis, and treatment depends on the specific cause.2. It is unclear where you are located, but in most places there is no need to send samples to a lab for treatment of conjunctivitis. Treatment is usually initiated based on the clinical evaluation by a doctor and responds well to topical antibiotics.3. Please consult an ophthalmologist immediately, as you are suffering from severe conjunctivitis. The swelling and tiredness may be due to the conjunctivitis and associated sinusitis or allergies.","1) Yes, it is possible that a parasite infestation can cause the symptoms that you have listed.  The most likely offender would be Toxocara Canis, a roundworm that commonly infects dogs (and, through this, humans).  Symptoms of this infestation would include:

""Most common symptoms include cough, wheeze or shortness of breath, abdominal pain or nausea, diarrhoea, headache, fever, fatigue, and coughing up of adult worms. Complications of toxocariasis can include anaphylaxis, and in rare cases, blindness and brain cysts.""

2) The reason that doctors might not be taking your samples seriously is because it is very unlikely that what you describe is actually caused by a parasitic infestation.  It's more likely that you are experiencing symptoms from a different cause, such as allergies or a cold.  I would recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and perhaps they may perform some tests, such as an X-ray or blood test, to help them diagnose your condition more accurately.","I am sorry to hear that you have been suffering from such a personal and distressing condition. It is important to remember that parasitic infections are diagnosed by examination of the specimen (in this case, the worms emerging from the nose and eyes) under a microscope by an expert in parasitology.

Strabismus surgery is typically performed by an ophthalmologist, which is a medical doctor who specializes in eye care.  In many cases, optometrists can also perform surgery, but it is not as common.

The best way to find an optometrist or ophthalmologist is through a personal recommendation from someone you trust, such as a friend or family member.  You can also check with your local medical association or society.

It's important to remember that surgery should be considered a last resort for treating strabismus.  That's because the side effects and risks of surgery can be significant.

"No, an abscess teeth cannot cause a heart attack. However, untreated abscess can cause severe pain and swelling that may be confused with symptoms of a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when there is a blockage in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart causing the heart muscle to fail. Abscess is a bacterial infection that can form in the teeth, gums, jaw, and other parts of the body. The symptoms of abscess include severe toothache, swelling of the gums, jaw, and neck, fever, and difficulty in opening the mouth. It is important to treat abscess as soon as possible to prevent complications such as swelling and pain. Treatment for abscess includes antibiotics, pain relievers, and in some cases, dental treatment. You must visit a doctor if you have symptoms of abscess. Hope I have answered your question.

""The presence of a dental abscess is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction.""","No, a tooth abscess cannot lead to a heart attack. A tooth abscess is a localized infection in a tooth. It does not cause inflammation in the blood vessels or travel to other parts of the body, so it cannot lead to a heart attack. Heart attacks occur when plaque buildup in the arteries causes inflammation and blocks blood flow to the heart.","No, tooth abscesses are not a common cause of heart attacks. The bacteria that cause tooth abscesses do not typically cause heart disease. However, poor dental hygiene and untreated tooth abscesses can increase the risk of other, more serious infections, which may be a cause of heart attacks.

Poor blood circulation can lead to cold extremities, and since hair is often lost in cold extremities, the two seem to be related. However, in actuality, they are two separate conditions. Hair loss on the lower limbs is usually caused by a genetic condition called Amylosis, which is the degeneration of the hair in the extremities. This condition is usually treated with medication or therapy. Poor blood circulation, on the other hand, can be treated by exercising regularly, eating healthily, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It is important to be aware of any symptoms of poor blood circulation, such as cold extremities, and to seek medical attention if necessary.","1. Avoid smoking: Smoking constricts blood vessels, decreasing circulation and speeding up hair loss.
2. Exercise: Regular exercise increases blood flow to the scalp, slowing down hair loss.
3. Eat well: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins nourishes the body from within, promoting healthy hair and scalp.
4. Avoid stress: Stress causes the body to hold onto cortisol, which can cause hair to fall out.
5. Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation increases stress hormones, causing more hair loss. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep every night.
6. Manage underlying medical conditions: Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases and other medical conditions can cause hair loss. Treatment for these conditions may help stop hair loss.
7. Shampoo less:Frequent shampooing, especially if your hair is color-treated, can cause hair to become dry and brittle, exacerbating hair loss.
8. Condition regularly: Conditioner can help detangle and add moisture to hair, reducing breakage and hair loss.
9. Avoid harsh treatments: Chemicals in hair dyes, straighteners and permanents, as well as hot irons and curling tongs, can damage hair, causing it to fall out.
10. Check for nutrient deficiencies: Hair is made up of protein, so a deficiency in this nutrient can cause hair to fall out. Iron and zinc deficiencies can also contribute to hair loss."
"1) Ear lobe crease is not always due to heart disease. It can be due to other factors such as aging and trauma.
2) If you do have arteriosclerosis, it depends on the extent. If it is mild then medications can be helpful. If it is severe, then surgery might be needed. Making healthy food choices and exercising regularly can help reduce the progression of arteriosclerosis and lead to a healthier life.","No.  While an earlobe crease is a strong indicator of past heart disease, it is not a definitive indicator of an impending heart attack.  Other factors such as family history, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking status should also be considered when assessing risk. 

Earlobe creases are a strong indicator of past heart disease due to the fact that during fetal development, the earlobes and rest of the body develop at the same time.  If the body experiences a period of poor blood flow (such as during a heart attack), the earlobes and rest of the body will develop at different rates, resulting in an absence of an earlobe crease.  While the presence of an earlobe crease is a strong indicator of past heart disease, it does not necessarily indicate an impending heart attack.  Other factors such as family history, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking status should also be considered when assessing risk.","1) Earlobe creases are a strong indication of heart disease.
However, they do not indicate an inevitable future heart attack.
Other factors, such as diet, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and family history also influence the development and severity of heart disease.
Therefore, even if you have earlobe creases, you can take action to reduce your risk of heart attack by adopting a healthy lifestyle and seeking medical attention as recommended by your doctor.","1. Earlobe creases are a weak sign of past or present heart disease.
 2. Other possible causes are trauma, aging, and genetic factors.
3. Diet impacts heart health by controlling the types of fats you consume, which can either contribute to or prevent the development of plaque buildup in your arteries.","No.  Earlobe creases are a weak indicator at best.  Diets are generally poor in America, even those who avoid red meat.  For a better assessment of risk, look at overall diet quality.  And don't worry about a lack of red meat, you can get enough protein from other sources.","There is some suggestion that the presence or absence of an earlobe crease may be associated with risk of cardiovascular disease, but the data are not particularly strong.
An earlobe crease indicates a person has a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, especially males. The absence of an earlobe crease usually indicates a lower risk. However, the absence of an earlobe crease may also be associated with an increased risk of kidney disease.
So, while earlobe creases may be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, there are probably many other factors (such as family history, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, etc.) that are much more important in predicting risk.
Earlobe creases may be more common in males than females, and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is more common in males than females. So, the association between earlobe creases and cardiovascular disease may simply be due to the fact that earlobe creases are more common in males, and males have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
In summary, an earlobe crease may be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but there are probably many other factors that are much more important in predicting risk."
"1. In the case of a small tumor, the surgical removal of the tumor is usually curative, but the cure rate is dependent upon the histologic type of the tumor.
2. The prognosis is also dependent upon the histologic type of the tumor and whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred.
3. The most common symptom is a painless rectal bleeding, but other symptoms can be caused by the tumor, depending upon its location.
4. The removal of the tumor and adjunctive chemotherapy is usually necessary to cure the condition.
5. The surgical removal of the tumor is the most common treatment.
6. The commonest serious complication is metastasis.
7. The most important laboratory test is the pathology report following surgery.
8. The most important factor in determining the prognosis is the histologic type of the tumor.
9. The average cost of surgery, if necessary, is about $10,000.",1. The tumor is small. 2. The removal will be complex because of its location.,"1. Tumor is not a benign tumor, it is a malignant tumor.
2. After surgery, the patient will need radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","1. Separating the tumor from the surrounding tissue is not complex. 
2. The difficulty lies in identifying and preserving the nerves and blood vessels that pass through the tumor.

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","Unfortunately, without a microscope, the only way to definitively diagnose a tumor is with a biopsy. However, there are several indicators that can make a presumptive diagnosis more likely. For instance, a tumor that is fleshy, soft, and freely mobile is much more likely to be a benign tumor than one that is firm, hard, or fixed to the tissue.

In the case of an ovarian tumor, the origin is somewhat more predictive as well. Benign tumors are much more likely to come from cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs that form in the ovaries as a part of normal function. These can often be aspirated (drawn out with a needle) and examined to determine whether they are cancerous or benign. Solid tumors, on the other hand, are much more likely to be cancerous, and may require more extensive surgery or chemotherapy to remove.

In summary, while it is not possible to definitively diagnose a tumor without a biopsy, there are several indicators that can make a presumptive diagnosis more likely.","1. The surgical removal process for a tumor depends on the type of tumor, its location, and its size. 
2. As a general surgeon, I am not able to accurately assess the extent of a tumor's involvement just by knowing its size. Other factors like the depth of the tumor, its attachment to adjacent structures, and its proximity to vital structures must also be taken into account. 
3. However, I can tell you that the surgical removal of even a small tumor can be quite involved and may require sophisticated surgical techniques like microscopic dissection. The recovery period can also be longer than expected, especially if the tumor is located in a critical area like the eye, brain, or spinal cord."

"21 Days after exposure to the virus, the infected person will develop the characteristic rash of shingles. The rash is called a ""dew drops on a rose"". The pain may be severe, and the rash may be accompanied by headache, fever, and chills. It is important that a physician be consulted so that antiviral medication may be prescribed, which will lessen the severity of the shingles and the pain associated with it. 
Once someone recovers from shingles, the virus does not leave the body. It goes into the nerves and waits. Sometimes the virus can reactivate years later when the person is older and their immune system is weakened. This is called Shingles. 
Herpes Zoster may reactivate when the person is stressed, or when they have an illness that weakens their immune system. The pain of Herpes Zoster is much worse than the pain of shingles. Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus causes pain and can lead to blindness. Herpes Zoster Vertebrae causes severe pain and may lead to damage of the spinal cord. The pain is so severe that it can lead to depression. 
A person who has shingles may develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a burning, stabbing pain that may last from months to years. The risk of PHN increases the closer the shingles outbreak is to the spine. One in five people will develop PHN. The pain is so severe that it can lead to depression. 

Antiviral medication can lessen the severity of the shingles and the pain associated with it.","1. The virus can be transferred to other people who have not had chickenpox as they are not immune to the virus. 
2. If someone who has not had chickenpox comes into contact with someone who has the virus, they can become infected with the virus. This is called a secondary transmission.
3. If a person is infected with VZV a second time, it is called shingles (or herpes zoster). About 1 in 5 people will have shingles in their lifetime.
4. If you have shingles, it is important to prevent the spread of the virus to others. From 1-2 weeks before the rash even starts, you can spread the virus to others. The virus can be spread from 1-5 days after the rash starts, until the rash has been present for 2-3 days.

"1. Endoscopy: This is a procedure where a long tube with a camera on the end is inserted into your mouth, and down into your stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).  The endoscope allows the doctor to see any abnormalities, including ulcers and the hernia.  If a biopsy is necessary, the doctor can take a small sample of tissue using tools passed down through the tube.  You will be under sedation for this procedure.  An endoscopy is typically used to diagnose hiatal hernias. 
2. Laparoscopy: This is a ""minor"" surgical procedure where a small incision is made in your belly, and a laparoscope is inserted.  The laparoscope is a tube with a camera on the end, which allows the surgeon to see any abnormalities.  Gas is pumped into your abdomen to provide space for the surgeon to work, and additional small incisions may be made to allow other tools to be inserted.  If the surgeon finds a hiatal hernia during your laparoscopy, he or she may attempt to reduce (push back into place) the hernia.  If unsuccessful, the surgeon may need to make a larger incision to repair the hernia.  You will be under general anesthesia for this procedure.  A laparoscopy is typically used to repair hiatal hernias.","1. Chat Doctor.  Hiatal hernia is usually not operated on unless its size is more than 3 cm with severe symptoms. 2.

Medical Therapy: Medical therapy is the first line of treatment for patients with hiatus hernia and acid reflux. Many patients with hiatus hernia and acid reflux can be effectively treated by medical therapy without the need for surgery. Medical therapy may be used in the treatment of hiatus hernia and acid reflux in patients without severe symptoms. Medical therapy may include: Lifestyle Changes: Lifestyle changes involve altering your daily habits to prevent further damage to your hiatus hernia and acid reflux. This may include: Eating small meals throughout the day rather than three large meals Avoiding lying down after meals Avoiding foods that worsen your symptoms such as spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol and acidic foods. Medications: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) such as Nexium are the most commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of hiatus hernia and acid reflux. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by your stomach which can help alleviate your symptoms. Other medications may also be prescribed depending on the severity of your symptoms. 2. Surgical: Surgery
Surgery is usually reserved for patients with severe symptoms of hiatus hernia and acid reflux that do not respond to medical therapy. Surgical options may include: Nissen Fundoplication: A Nissen fundoplication is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon wraps the upper part of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This prevents your stomach from moving up into your esophagus as well as increases the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter which can help prevent acid reflux. Hill: A Hill is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon repairs the hiatal hernia by pushing the stomach down into the abdomen and closing off the opening in the diaphragm. This surgery is usually reserved for patients with severe symptoms that are not responding to medical therapy.","Yes. The first step in treating hiatal hernia and acid reflux is to adopt a lifestyle that reduces reflux. This includes eating smaller meals, avoiding foods that worsen the reflux, avoiding lying down after eating, and maintaining a healthy weight. It also includes avoiding foods that can irritate the stomach lining, including citrus fruit, orange juice, tomatoes, and spicy foods. In addition, you should avoid any foods and drinks that contain caffeine. Caffeine can irritate the stomach lining and worsen reflux. 

For some people, reducing reflux through lifestyle changes alone is enough to control their symptoms. However, many people need medication to control their symptoms. Medications used to treat hiatal hernia and acid reflux include the Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium, as well as H2 receptor blockers like Tagamet®. PPIs are more effective than H2 receptor blockers and are often prescribed for patients with more severe symptoms.","1. Medical Therapy

"1. Dietary modification: The first step in treating flatulence is to modify the diet. This includes decreasing the amount of fatty food, spicy food, dairy products, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, beans, lentils, onions, and garlic. All of these foods are difficult to digest and may produce flatus.
2. Drug therapy: a. Metronidazole: This medication is frequently prescribed for the treatment of flatulence. It has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is effective in treating the hidden causes of flatulence.b. Probiotics: These are effective in maintaining a proper balance of bacteria in the bowel and reducing the symptoms of flatulence.c. Antibiotics: In cases where there is an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the bowel, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the condition.","Medical solutions to excessive flatulence, also known as flatulence or gas, can be grouped into three main categories: dietary modifications, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions. The first step in managing flatulence is to make dietary modifications. Although there is no clear consensus on which foods should be avoided, it is generally accepted that patients should reduce their intake of carbohydrates such as wheat, rye, and sodas. In addition, patients should limit their intake of foods that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, such as cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and asparagus. On the other hand, patients should increase their intake of foods high in digestible carbohydrates, such as rice, potatoes, and bananas. Pharmacotherapy is the second approach to managing flatulence. The most commonly used drugs are prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, erythromycin, and cisapride. Prokinetic agents increase gastric motility and reduce the retention time of food in the stomach and small intestine, which leads to a significant decrease in flatulence. Surgical interventions are considered the last resort for managing refractory cases of flatulence. The most commonly used surgical intervention is surgical decompression of the internal components of the intestine, which leads to a significant reduction in the amount of gas that is produced. In conclusion, medical solutions to excessive flatulence can be grouped into dietary modifications, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions. The first step in managing flatulence is to make dietary modifications, such as reducing intake of carbohydrates and increasing intake of foods high in digestible carbohydrates. Pharmacotherapy is the second approach to managing flatulence, using prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, erythromycin, and cisapride. Surgical interventions are considered the last resort for managing refractory cases of flatulence, using surgical decompression of the internal components of the intestine.","14.1 There are a number of ways to treat flatulence, but the primary method is to address the underlying cause of the flatulence. In the absence of an identifiable cause, a simple dietary modification to decrease intake of fermentable carbohydrates may be warranted. If the flatulence is due to intolerance of lactose, reduction or elimination of all milk and milk products from the diet may be all that is required. In patients with lactase deficiency, the addition of the lactase enzyme to milk and milk products allows for their continued consumption. If the flatulence is due to intolerance of lactose, reduction or elimination of all milk and milk products from the diet may be all that is required. In patients with carbohydrate intolerance, such as those with celiac disease or diabetes mellitus type 1, treatment of the underlying condition and follow-up with a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates may be required. In patients with celiac disease, complete removal of gluten from the diet is mandatory. A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates will also decrease the symptoms of flatulence in these patients. In patients with gastrointestinal infections, such as bacterial overgrowth syndromes, treatment with antimicrobial agents may be indicated. If there is a history of gastrointestinal infections, such as bacterial overgrowth syndromes, treatment with antimicrobial agents may be indicated. In patients with decreased bowel movements, such as those with constipation, treating the constipation may lead to a decrease in flatulence.","1. Dietary modifications:

Limit intake of fermentable carbohydrates (FC), such as raffinose, stachyose, and sucrose, which are found in foods like beans, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, and other vegetables such as asparagus, artichokes, and onions.

Additionally, you may need to limit intake of sugar alcohols such as xylitol and sorbitol, which are found in many sugar-free products and are difficult to digest.

2. Supplementation with Lactobacillus:

You can take a probiotic supplement that contains Lactobacillus, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, or Lactobacillus salivarius. These are the most common species used in probiotics and shown to be effective in research studies.

3. Supplementation with alpha-galactosidase:

You can take a supplement containing alpha-galactosidase, which is an enzyme that helps break down the complex sugars found in FC.

4. Carb tolerance:

If you can’t eliminate FC from your diet, you can try to increase your carb tolerance by gradually introducing FC into your diet. Start with small servings and gradually increase until you can tolerate them without increased gas.

5. Behavior modification:

Try changing your behavior by chewing your food more thoroughly, eating more slowly, and avoiding talking while eating.",1. Difficulty in digesting certain foods 2. Swollen intestines 3.

Lactose intolerance is an autoimmune disorder in which the body is unable to produce enough lactase, an enzyme needed to digest lactose, a sugar that is a constituent of milk and other dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include flatulence, bloating, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The most common dairy offenders are milk and cheese. Try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks and see if your symptoms go away. If you decide to reintroduce them, do so slowly and in small amounts.
2. Fruits and vegetables - Fruits and vegetables contain a natural sugar called fructose. If you are not used to eating fruits and vegetables, this sugar may not be absorbed completely, causing it to be fermented by intestinal bacteria, resulting in excessive flatulence. Easing into a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is the best way to avoid discomfort. Start by replacing one meal with a fruit or vegetable-based meal each week.
3. Beans - Beans are a good source of protein, but they also contain raffinose, a sugar that is also difficult to absorb. Like fruits and vegetables, beans contain a type of carbohydrate that our bodies cannot digest, so they end up being fermented by bacteria in the intestines and producing gas.
4. Artificial sweeteners - This may seem surprising, but artificial sweeteners can cause flatulence. Most people do not have a problem digesting them, but for others, the body is not able to absorb these sweeteners completely, which can lead to intestinal disturbances and subsequent flatulence.
5. Swallowing a lot of air - When you swallow a lot of air, it collects in your intestines and gets absorbed later, causing flatulence. To prevent this from happening, slow down your eating and avoid eating when you're stressed or anxious.

The symptoms in adults are different and is named as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  The symptoms are similar to that of child ADHD but here they are in detail.  Poor concentration, forgetfulness, procrastination, poor time management, restlessness, being easily distracted and impulsiveness are some of the symptoms seen in ADHD.  However there are other conditions which have symptoms similar to that of ADHD and they are:   1. Bipolar disorder: It is characterized by extreme mood swings like mania and depression. 2. Anxiety disorders: It is characterized by excessive and persistent worry and anxiety. 3. Depressive disorders: It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. 4. Psychotic disorders: It is characterized by detachment from reality, hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking. 5. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause side effects that mimic ADHD symptoms. These side effects may include: - Problems concentrating - Mood swings - Anxiety - Insomnia - Irritability - Decreased appetite. 6. Substance abuse: Certain illicit drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, can cause symptoms of ADHD. 7. Thyroid disorders: Thyroid disorders such as hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. 8. Learning disabilities: While ADHD and learning disabilities share some symptoms, learning disabilities typically involve difficulties with reading, writing, math, or social interactions. 9. Traumatic brain injury (TBI): Some symptoms of ADHD may be caused by traumatic brain injury, which can occur from any trauma to the head. 10. Other psychiatric disorders: Other psychiatric disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD","The symptoms of adult ADHD can be mistaken for other conditions, such as:

Middle-aged males with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate or sulfasalazine.,The most recent developments in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for middle-aged men are Xeljanz (tofacitinib) and Kevzara (sarilumab).,"1. Prednisone or other glucocorticoids may be used as an initial treatment. 2. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine may be used in combination with glucocorticoids. 3. Biologic agents such as TNF-alpha inhibitors, interleukin-1 receptor antagonists, or anakinra may be used in combination with glucocorticoids and/or DMARDs. 4. Surgery may be used to correct joint deformities or replace joints.","As an internal medicine doctor, I cannot give a specific answer without knowing the patient and looking at the patient's records.  However, I can give you some general information about rheumatoid arthritis in middle-aged men.  Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. It can also affect other parts of the body. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, biologic agents, and pain relievers. Other treatments may include physical therapy, exercise, heat or cold therapy, and rest. The treatment plan will depend on the patient's age, overall health, and the severity of the disease. It is important for patients to work closely with their doctors to create a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific symptoms and needs.","The newest approaches to treating rheumatoid arthritis in middle-aged males involve the use of biologic agents, such as etanercept and infliximab. These drugs target specific parts of the immune system to reduce inflammation and slow or stop joint damage. Previously, gold standards of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate. While these older treatments are still often used, they have been shown to be less effective in middle-aged males, who tend to have more severe symptoms earlier in the course of the disease. The use of biologic agents has revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by offering targeted therapy with fewer side effects than older treatments.","The most recent advances in the management of rheumatoid arthritis for middle-aged men include the use of biologic agents, such as etanercept and infliximab. 

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Middle-aged men, in particular, are at increased risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis.

Biologic agents, such as etanercept and infliximab, work by targeting specific parts of the immune system to reduce inflammation and slow down joint damage. These medications are administered by injection or infusion and have been shown to be highly effective in reducing symptoms and improving physical function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

It is important to note that the management of rheumatoid arthritis involves a combination of medication, physical therapy and lifestyle modifications, and treatment plans are individualized based on the patient's specific needs and symptoms."

If it is not possible, then the other treatment options include embolization, radiofrequency ablation, and chemotherapy.4. The prognosis of the disease is generally good for benign tumors. The prognosis becomes worse if the tumor is malignant and metastatic.5. Yes, it is possible. As the disease is rare, the carrier woman has less possibility to get the disease compared with the man. Moreover, the surgical treatment is effective. Therefore, the pregnancy and the birth of the child are possible.","Answer: IVF can help in preventing the condition in the future children provided the sperm is from a normal man. The problem lies with the sperm and not the egg. If you are the carrier of the gene, your child may get the disease. If you are normal, the child will not get the disease. Therefore, if you want to have your own child, it is best to go for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and select the normal embryo. With PGD, the problem can be prevented. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards",yes it would.  In vitro fertilization would reduce the risk of passing many genetically transferred diseases on to kids.  It is a good option for people who are carriers of a disease like this and want to have their own kids and not pass it on.,"Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease. In vitro fertilization(IVF) is not a guarantee that your future child will not have the disease. There is a 50% chance that your child will inherit the disease. If you really want to avoid the disease, you should go for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). With the help of PGD, only unaffected embryos are transferred back into the uterus. This will help you in avoiding the disease. But IVF is not helpful in this case.","Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma are rare congenital conditions usually caused by hereditary mutations.  If there is a strong family history of these conditions, your girlfriend may carry one of the mutations that increases your risk of having a child with the condition.  IVF can be performed with pre-implantation genetic screening (PCS) of the embryos.  This involves taking eggs, fertilizing them with sperm outside of the body, growing the embryos in the lab and then screening for the mutation.  If the mutation is present, the embryos can be genetically tested and only embryos without the mutation can be transferred to the uterus.  This would be a viable option to prevent transmission of the condition.  I would suggest that you and your girlfriend speak to a genetic counselor to confirm whether PCS is an option for you.","Carrier testing is performed when there is a family history of a genetic disorder, and the couple is planning to have children. Carrier testing can help in predicting the chance of the future child inheriting the disorder. Carrier testing is done by examining the DNA of the potential parents. The test results help in predicting whether the parents are carriers or not. Knowing the risk can help the couple make reproductive choices like using in vitro fertilization to select the embryos that do not have the mutated gene. It can also help in prenatal diagnosis and treatment of the disorder in the child. The success of carrier testing depends on the accuracy of reporting the family history and knowing the molecular basis of the genetic disorder. In this case, a detailed family history and knowledge of the molecular basis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are required to perform carrier testing. I suggest you discuss this with your geneticist or endocrinologist. Good luck!"

"1. What is the complication? Prolapse of the vagina is a complication of some other condition which has to be identified. 2. Why do you need vaginal repair? Just pushing the vagina back in isn't going to help if there is a structural defect causing prolapse. 3. Is it worth it? If the condition causing the prolapse is identified and properly treated, vaginal prolapse can be prevented. 4. Will it prolapse again, then what. If the underlying condition is not treated, the prolapse will recur. This needs to be explained to you by a physician after a thorough exam.","Vaginal repair surgery is a surgical procedure done to correct issues with the vagina such as prolapse. Prolapse is when the pelvic organs such as the uterus, cervix, or rectum bulge into the vagina. Vaginal repair surgery can be done through the traditional open approach or laparoscopically (minimally invasive). Vaginal repair surgery can be done for a number of reasons, for example if it's done for stress urinary incontinence the surgery is often successful in improving symptoms. 

As with any surgery, there are risks to vaginal repair surgery, such as infection, blood clots, or injury to surrounding organs or nerves. There are also risks to not having the surgery, such as discomfort, pelvic organ prolapse, or difficulty with bowel movements or urination. It is best to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of vaginal repair surgery to decide if it is right for you. 

It is true that prolapse can recur after vaginal repair surgery, but it is important to note that prolapse can also recur after no treatment. The rate of prolapse recurrence after surgery is about 20%, which means that 80% of women who have surgery do not have their prolapse recur. It is important to discuss with your doctor the likelihood of prolapse recurrence and how to manage it if it does recur.","The success rate for vaginal repair surgery is very high, with recurrence of prolapse being a very rare complication.","The real benefits of vaginal repair include cure of urinary incontinence, cure of sexual dysfunction, cure of obstruction, and prevention of further prolapse. The drawbacks of vaginal repair include the risks of surgery, such as infection, bleeding, and injury to adjacent structures. The risk of having another prolapse down the line after vaginal repair is less than 1%.","It is important to understand that vaginal repair is not a permanent solution and that you will still be at risk for future prolapse. Vaginal repair can be a helpful short-term solution if you are experiencing mild symptoms, but it is important to understand that it is not a permanent solution. Future prolapse is likely, especially if you have had children or are experiencing significant symptoms. It is important to discuss your long-term health and any potential risks with your healthcare provider. In some cases, additional surgical interventions may be necessary in the future to address prolapse. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks of vaginal repair and to discuss your individual situation with a healthcare provider.",There are no guarantees in medicine and with surgery there is always a risk involved. If the surgery does not work out there is always the possibility of relapse of the prolapse. It is important to discuss these risks with your surgeon prior to surgery

Additionally, individuals with genetic syndromes that predispose them to skin cancer should be monitored closely by a dermatologist.",The answer is A (autosomal dominant) and B (autosomal recessive).,"90% of the time, skin cancer in Caucasian adults is related to genetic factors.","Yes, genetic predispositions can increase the risk of skin cancer in Caucasian adults. The risk of skin cancer is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In Caucasians, genetic factors are responsible for 80% of the variation in the risk of skin cancer, while environmental factors such as UV exposure and lifestyle are responsible for the remaining 20% [1]. The genetic factors that influence the risk of skin cancer include mutations in the genes that encode for the p53 tumor suppressor, defects in the immune system, and variations in the genes that encode for the production of enzymes involved in the metabolism of chemiccal carcinogens [1]. It is important for Caucasian adults to be aware of their genetic predisposition to skin cancer and to take steps to reduce their risk through protective behaviors such as using sunscreen and avoiding prolonged UV exposure."
"2 years is a long time not to get pregnant if you are sexually active.  I would recommend that you get a pregnancy test done first thing.  It is inexpensive and easy to do at home.  If that is negative, then you should make an appointment with your doctor to have some basic tests done.  You should have blood work to check your hormone levels and a ultrasound to check your uterus and ovaries.  It is possible that you have a problem with your periods (like PCOS) that would make it difficult to get pregnant.  It is also possible that your partner has a problem that prevents pregnancy.

There are many factors that can affect fertility, such as age, weight, whether the woman has gone through menopause, etc. But simply being sexually active without using birth control for 2 years likely won't result in a woman not getting pregnant.

It's important to note that pregnancy is possible even when proper birth control methods are used and a woman has regular periods. The failure rate for birth control can be quite high, and a woman can still become pregnant, especially if she has unprotected sex during ovulation.

On average, a woman can become pregnant about 2 weeks after having her period, starting about 5 days after ovulation (the day of ovulation being the first day of her next period). This means that even if a woman has regular periods, she can still become pregnant if she has unprotected sex during that time.

Of course, there are many factors that can affect this. For example, the woman may not be ovulating regularly, or the man may have a low sperm count, or the woman may have already gone through menopause, etc. 

It's also worth noting that 2 years isn't a very long time when it comes to fertility. Women are born with a limited number of eggs, and the quality of those eggs starts to decline after age 35. So the older a woman gets, the less likely she is to become pregnant, especially if she has other risk factors such as smoking or being overweight.","2 years is a long time to be trying though not impossible, especially if you have irregular periods. If you haven't fallen pregnant after 2 years, you can get investigated. Get an ultrasound done to check the ovaries and uterus. Also get a semen analysis done for your partner. If everything is fine, you can try medications for ovulation induction or consider IVF."
103.5 is a very high fever. Call your doctor immediately. Do not wait. This is an emergency. You should go to the ER.,"1. Measure the temperature correctly. 9 Months is a very important age for babies. They start to explore the world by crawling and pulling themselves up to stand. They are also very curious and tend to put things in their mouths, which can be dangerous if they're sharp or breakable. It's also common for them to have their 12 month vaccinations this month. 
2. Take the correct temperature. A temperate of 103.5 is higher than a typical fever, but not an emergency room temperature. It's important to take a correct temperature to make sure that it is actually a fever. You should use a rectal thermometer for babies under 3 months, and an oral thermometer for everyone else. Make sure that the thermometer is the correct size for the age of your child, and that it is put in correctly to get an accurate reading. 
3. Dress for the temperature. If your child is wearing too many layers, they will get too hot and their body temperature will rise. If they're cold, their body will try to generate heat by shivering, which can also raise their temperature. Make sure they're wearing appropriate clothing for the weather. 
4. Give over the counter medicine. If your child has a fever, you can give them acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the package, and give them fluids as well to prevent dehydration. 
5. Monitor the fever. Fever usually lasts for 2-3 days. After that time, the fever should break on its own. If the fever lasts longer than 3 days, or if your child becomes lethargic, it's important to take them to the emergency room. It's also important to take them if they have a fever and are under 3 months old, have a weakened immune system, or have other health problems.","103.5 is not a particularly high fever in an infant. You can try to lower her temperature by giving her acetaminophen (Tylenol), but it is not necessary to rush her to the ER. Give her plenty of fluids, keep her in a cool room, and try to monitor her fever trend. If it looks like her fever is getting worse or is not responding to acetaminophen, then ER is where she needs to go. But 103.5 is not a fever that calls for an ER visit immediately. Hope this helps!","1. Some ways to bring a fever down are giving acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if your doctor says it's okay), giving cool sponge baths, and using cool washcloths on your child's forehead and neck. 

2. I would not recommend taking your child to the emergency room at this temperature, unless she shows signs of extreme distress (for example, she's lethargic, not taking milk, or has a rash). Instead, try the remedies mentioned above to help bring her fever down. If her fever continues for more than 2 days or shows signs of extreme distress, take her to the emergency room.","103.5 is not a particularly high fever, and you can help reduce it without medication by giving acetaminophen or ibuprofen (but not both), undressing your daughter and giving her a cool bath, and making sure she has plenty of fluids to drink. If the fever persists or becomes even higher, then yes, you should take her to the ER. Until then, there's no need; fevers of less than 104 are very common and usually not a cause for concern.","103.5 is a high fever and you should visit the ER, but you can try to lower the fever before heading there. A cold bath or wet washcloth on the forehead, or a combination of both might help. Don't use a fan or AC because the child will get chilled. If the fever breaks before you get to the ER, take the child to a doctor right away because emergency fever can be caused by many things, including meningitis, which can be fatal if not treated quickly. If the fever doesn't break, go to the ER because they have the equipment and medication needed to treat emergency fever. Most importantly, don't give the child aspirin, and call the doctor immediately if the child has a rash, seizure, or extreme drowsiness."

Celiac Disease, Autoimmune Thyroid disease) 2) Idiopathic, Immune mediated causes make up about 85% of all cases of Type 1 Diabetes in children. More information: http://www.diabetes.ca/diabetes-and-you/youth-and-type-1-diabetes/what-causes-type-1-diabetes/","The cause of the autoimmune diabetes in children (type 1 diabetes) is not completely understood. It is thought that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Type 1 diabetes used to be referred to as ""juvenile diabetes"" because it typically is diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults. In children, type 1 diabetes is rare. Those with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to survive.

Insulin-dependent diabetes in children (type 1) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This causes high blood glucose levels. The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known. It is thought to result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

2) Immune-mediated factors (idiopathic type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with autoimmunity, and this pathology may be the cause or the effect of the disease)","Currently the exact cause of the destruction of the insulin producing cells in the pancreas of diabetic patients, is not known exactly. Research is still going on in this aspect.
Usually the onset of diabetes in children is an autoimmune phenomenon. That means the body's own immune system acts against the insulin producing cells and destroys them. The exact reason for this abnormal immune reaction is not known.
Diabetes is not contagious, so it can't spread from one child to another. Also, diabetes is not infectious, so exposure to an infected patient will not cause diabetes.
The following risk factors are known to contribute to the development of diabetes in children:
1) Family history of diabetes. 2) Obesity 3) Abnormal lipids. 4) Physical inactivity. 5) Certain ethnic groups, like Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans and Australians.",β-cell destruction by autoimmune destruction or genetic mutations triggers insulin-dependent diabetes in young children.,"There are different types of diabetes, but juvenile diabetes (also known as insulin-dependent diabetes) is caused by the body's inability to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that allows the body to use glucose found in food for energy. When you eat, your body breaks down food into glucose, which is then absorbed by the small intestine and enters the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, the pancreas is signaled to release insulin to allow the body's cells to absorb the glucose. This is the basic cause of diabetes. 

However, with juvenile diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the body does not respond to insulin properly. This is called insulin dependence. The lack of insulin causes glucose to build up in the blood instead of being absorbed by the body's cells. To treat this type of diabetes, patients must inject insulin several times a day to control blood glucose levels. 

Other types of diabetes are caused by the body's resistance to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. Patients with this type of diabetes still produce insulin, but their bodies do not use it effectively. As a result, blood glucose levels may be high, but not as high as those seen in patients with juvenile diabetes. Patients with insulin resistance may eventually need insulin therapy as well. 

It is important to understand that while there are different types of diabetes, the symptoms and treatment for all types of diabetes are essentially the same. Patients with any type of diabetes must monitor their blood glucose levels frequently, and make changes to their diet and lifestyle to prevent complications."

"1. Reducible hernia: A hernia which can be reduced by gentle pressure on the hernial sac with one or both hands, after having palpated the abdomen to locate the hernia, is a reducible hernia. The technique of reduction is explained below:

After locating the hernia, put on gloves. Place the index finger of each hand into the ring finger portion of the glove. This is to ensure that the finger tips are covered and the fingers are close to the palm, which is important to avoid injury to the finger pads which could happen when the hernial sac is retracted through the ring.

Have the patient lie down in the supine position. Place the patient in a comfortable position.

With one hand, encircle the hernial ring with the index and the ring finger of the gloved hand. With the other hand, grasp the hernial sac with the thumb in the slot and the fingers encircling the sac just proximal to the ring.

Gently but firmly, pull the hernial sac back through the ring. The reducible hernia is reduced.

If the hernia cannot be reduced in this way, it is an irreducible hernia, and you should refer this patient to a general surgeon. 2. Irreducible hernia: An irreducible hernia is an unreduceable hernia. It is an emergency. You should refer this patient to a general surgeon as soon as possible.

2. Preventing inguinal hernias is important, but how do I avoid them if I have a family history?

If you have a family history of inguinal hernias, there are some steps you can take to prevent developing one:

• Strengthen your abdominal muscles. Strong abdominal muscles can help prevent inguinal hernias. Try core exercises like planks, bridges, and crunches to build up your muscles.

• Watch your weight. Obesity increases your risk of developing an inguinal hernia. Work to maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

• Avoid heavy lifting. Heavy lifting can cause a hernia or make one worse. If you need to lift heavy objects, be sure to use proper form and technique.

• Avoid constipation. Constipation can cause increased abdominal pressure, which can make it easier for a hernia to develop. Drink plenty of fluids and eat a high-fiber diet to prevent constipation.

• Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining during bowel movements can increase abdominal pressure and put you at risk for a hernia.

• Avoid coughing and sneezing. These actions can increase abdominal pressure and put you at risk for a hernia.

• Avoid aggressive coughing and straining in the bathroom.

• Avoid pregnancy. Pregn","Hernias are very common, especially in men over 50. An inguinal hernia occurs when part of your intestine protrudes through the muscle through which blood vessels pass.

Dear Reader, 
Thanks for your question. I am sorry to hear about your hernia. An untreated hernia can cause significant discomfort and even life-threatening complications if strangulation occurs. So it is important that you follow up with your doctor to discuss treatment options. 
Exercise alone will not fix a hernia. A hernia occurs when an organ or tissue protrudes through the wall of the cavity that contains it. Improving core strength with exercise may help reduce the severity of symptoms, but will not repair the hernia. 
Treatment for a hernia may involve lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and avoiding heavy lifting. It may also involve surgery to repair the hernia. Your doctor can help you determine the best course of action. 
So I encourage you to follow up with your doctor to discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I would avoid strenuous exercise that may put additional stress on the hernia.","1.  Planks - this is a great exercise to strengthen your

"‎It is a common problem. The fall in BP during sleep is a normal phenomenon. This is termed as nocturnal dip. The exact mechanism is not known. It is thought to be related to the altered metabolism and blood flow during sleep. A fall in BP during sleep is not a problem unless there is a symptom like dizziness, fatigue, etc. In your case, the BP at night is more than the daytime BP. So it is problematic. You have not mentioned your daytime BP. You should keep a watch on it. You can inquire about the timing of the BP medicines. Some BP medicines are effective if taken at night. Discuss with your doctor regarding this.","Yes, this is a common occurrence. The body's natural biorhythm usually calls for a dip in blood pressure during sleep. For most people, this dip is not severe enough to cause problems.
However, many people experience a more dramatic decrease in blood pressure while they sleep, which can lead to what is called ""night-time hypertension.""
Night-time hypertension is defined as having a blood pressure of 120/80 or higher when measured at night after you've been asleep for a few hours.
If you believe you have night-time hypertension, it is important to talk to your doctor. Your medications may need to be adjusted, or you may need additional medications to help control your blood pressure throughout the day and night.","It's common for blood pressure to spike at night, even for people taking medication. The reason for this is often dehydration. During the day, you drink water and other fluids, which helps maintain your blood pressure. When you sleep, you often don't drink as much, which can lead to dehydration and a spike in blood pressure. Try to drink more water before you go to bed to help prevent this.

So I will assume they are for high blood pressure and that you are on 4 different medications for that.
High blood pressure is often a 24 hour problem, with the blood pressure elevated when you are awake and also when you are asleep.  There are many different medications that can be used to treat high blood pressure, and if you are on medications that work throughout the day, then it is common to add a higher dose of a medication that works at night to help you get your blood pressure under control.  The most commonly used medication for this is called ""nighttime"" or ""PM"" aspirin which is taken once a day at bedtime.  
If you are on medications that do not work throughout the day, then it is common to add a higher dose of a medication that works for 24 hours to help you get your blood pressure under control.  The most commonly used medication for this is called ""twice a day"" or ""bid"" hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) which is taken twice a day.
If neither of these work, then other medications including the ""third"" or ""trough"" medications can be used.  
So, to answer your question, your blood pressure is rising at night because you are probably on medications that work for 24 hours, and it is time to add a higher dose of medication that works at night.","4- Answer: The cause of your increased blood pressure at night may be related to inadequate fluid intake, excessive salt intake, underlying anxiety or stress, or certain medications. It is important to talk to your doctor about your medications and if any of them may be contributing to your high blood pressure at night. It is also important to make sure you are drinking enough fluids throughout the day and not excessively salting your food.

"Glaucoma is an eye disease caused by damage to the optic nerve. It is characterized by progressive loss of peripheral vision. The disease is often asymptomatic at first. It is usually diagnosed when it is too late to reverse the damage to the optic nerve. Treatment involves reducing intraocular pressure. One way of reducing the intraocular pressure is by creating a drainage fistula, which involves making a small hole in the eye to help fluid drain. Another way is by using medicated eye drops. There are different types of glaucoma, such as open angle and closed angle glaucoma. Closed angle glaucoma is a medical emergency because it can cause permanent blindness within a few days. A doctor can diagnose glaucoma by measuring the intraocular pressure. Vision loss due to glaucoma is irreversible.","Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the optic nerve is damaged, causing gradual loss of vision. The optic nerve is responsible for transmitting images from the eye to the brain.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is a painless condition that causes damage to the optic nerve, which can result in gradual loss of vision, starting with peripheral vision. The condition is caused by fluid pressure in the eye, which causes damage to the optic nerve.

There are two main types of glaucoma: open angle glaucoma and closed angle glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma and is often asymptomatic. Closed angle glaucoma is less common and is characterized by a sudden increase of intraocular pressure, which causes severe eye pain and must be treated immediately to prevent permanent vision loss.

There is no cure for glaucoma, but it can be managed with treatment, such as medications, laser therapy, or surgery, to reduce intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. It is important to begin treatment as soon as possible to prevent permanent vision loss.","1. What is glaucoma?
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases in which the optic nerve is damaged, leading to progressive vision loss and, if left untreated, blindness. It is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.Glaucoma occurs when the fluid pressure inside the eye increases. The increased pressure may cause damage to the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting images from the eye to the brain.  Glaucoma is often asymptomatic at first, but warnings signs include loss of peripheral vision, ghostly halos around lights, eye pain or discomfort, red eye, and blurred vision. With early detection and treatment, most people with glaucoma can manage their condition and will not lose vision.

There are several types of glaucoma. The most common type of glaucoma is chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG), which often has no symptoms until permanent vision loss occurs.  Acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) is a medical emergency which manifests with sudden, painful vision loss, nausea and vomiting. It is caused by rapid increase of the intraocular pressure (IOP).  Lens epithelium syndrome is a complication of AACG which occurs when the healthy eye is damaged by the surgical removal of a cataract.  Low-tension or normal tension glaucoma is a condition in which optic nerve damage occurs with intraocular pressure (IOP) within the normal range.  Secondary glaucomas are caused by various medical conditions which damage the optic nerve such as inflammation, medications, diabetes, or genetic factors.","Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the internal eye pressure increases and may cause damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve is responsible for transmitting images from the eye to the brain.
The increased pressure in the eye causes damage to the optic nerve.
The optic nerve is responsible for transmitting images from the eye to the brain.
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.
However, proper treatment can help prevent or control the progression of the disease.
The following are types of glaucoma:
Open angle glaucoma Close angle glaucoma
Low-tension or normal tension glaucoma
Congenital glaucoma
Glaucoma suspect
Secondary glaucomas
Pigmentary glaucoma
Infectious glaucoma
Pseudoglaucoma","Glaucoma is an eye disease caused by damage to the optic nerve. It is often associated with increased pressure inside the eye. Open angle glaucoma is the most common form. It is painless and causes no symptoms until vision is gradually lost. Acute glaucoma is much less common and is caused by a sudden increase in intraocular pressure, which causes severe eye pain and is followed by rapid loss of vision. Glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring the intraocular pressure, examining the optic nerve, and testing visual field. Treatment involves reducing intraocular pressure. This may be done with medications, laser therapy, or surgery. The appropriate treatment depends upon the type and severity of the glaucoma.",1. Increased pressure in the eye 2.

"There is a very small study that was published in the journal Archives of Ophthalmology that demonstrated an increased prevalence of autism in a group of patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). 

The study evaluated 31 patients with LCA and 200 control subjects. The researchers tested the visual acuity of the patients with LCA and the control subjects. They then asked the parents of the patients with LCA to fill out the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) questionnaire. The researchers found that the prevalence of autism in the patients with LCA was 19.4 percent, which was more than twice the 8.6 percent prevalence in the control subjects.

This was a small study, and more research needs to be done to confirm the relationship, or lack thereof, between LCA and autism. However, this study did show an increased prevalence of autism in patients with LCA.","There is a very small association between LCA and autism. A study was conducted on 30 patients with LCA and 30 control patients without LCA; the frequency of autistic behavior was 8% in patients with LCA and 1% in control patients. 

""Eight percent of the LCA patients and 1% of the control patients exhibited autistic behavior. The most common behaviors observed in LCA patients were rocking and hand-wringing movements. The autistic behavior was mostly mild and did not interfere with daily living activities.""

A recent study has found a higher rate of autistic behavior in patients with LCA.

""Recently, we have detected autistic behavior in 8% of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) patients. This rate is higher than that in the general population. The present study aims to detect any related factors in LCA patients. We thus compared the age of onset of blindness, IQ, and the behavioral abnormality of LCA patients with those of 200 normal subjects. The results revealed that the age of onset of blindness and the IQ score were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the behavioral abnormality was higher in LCA patients (P = 0.041).""","Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare genetic disorder that causes severe visual impairment or blindness from birth. It is caused by defects in the retina, and can be caused by defects in any one of a number of different genes. 
Autism is a developmental disorder that typically emerges in early childhood, and causes problems with social interaction, communication, and behavior. While there are a number of different genetic and environmental factors that can contribute to the development of autism, many cases are associated with abnormalities in the brain, including the retina. 
There is currently no known connection between LCA and autism. However, as research into both conditions continues to advance, there is always the possibility that more connections will be found.","There is some evidence to suggest that there may be a link between Leber Congenital Amaurosis and Autism. Both of these conditions are thought to be caused by problems with the development of the nervous system during pregnancy. Some studies have shown that children with LCA are more likely to also have developmental delays and other developmental disorders, including Autism. However, it is important to note that most children with LCA do not go on to develop Autism or other developmental disorders. Leber Congenital Amaurosis is a rare condition on its own, and the link to Autism is still being studied. It is important for parents of children with LCA to work closely with their healthcare providers and specialists to monitor their child's development and provide the support and services they need to reach their full potential.","There is a very strong correlation between LCA and autism.  In fact, some of the clinical features of LCA, such as the presence of aniridia (absence of the iris), may be the best clinical indicator that a child will later develop autism.  The cause of this correlation is not well understood, but it is thought that both LCA and autism involve abnormal development of the brain, which may share some of the same genetic and environmental risk factors.  Finally, it is important to note that the vast majority of children with LCA do not go on to develop autism, and that autism is a highly variable condition that can range from very mild to severe and disabling.","There is currently no known association between Leber Congenital Amaurosis and Autism.   

Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a rare genetic disorder that affects vision and is caused by mutations in any one of over 18 genes associated with retinal development. It is characterized by severe visual impairment at birth and is unrelated to autism.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the other hand, is a developmental disorder that typically emerges in early childhood and is characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, and repetitive or ritualized behaviors. While there have been some studies examining the potential link between LCA and ASD, there is currently no known association between the two disorders.

It is important to note, however, that as research in the field of genetics and neurodevelopment continues to advance, the possibility of a connection between LCA and ASD cannot be entirely ruled out. Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship (if any) between these two conditions."

Since you have had scalp psoriasis for almost a decade, I would recommend that you see a dermatologist for treatment.

2. Since you have H. influenza type b, I would recommend that you use a topical medication with a steroid and/or a topical medication with a Vitamin D analogue, such as calcitriol or calcipotriene.

3. I would also recommend that you use a medicated shampoo on your scalp twice a week.

4. I would not recommend the use of steroids or biologics at this time, as your lesions are not severe enough to warrant their use.

5. I would also recommend that you use an oral antihistamine, such as fexofenadine, to help relieve itching.

6. Be sure to avoid using any harsh soaps or shampoos on your scalp and to use a moisturizer to help keep your scalp hydrated.

7. It is also important to avoid any triggers, such as stress, that may cause flare-ups.","1. Topical therapies: These include medicated shampoos, creams, and ointments that are applied directly to the affected area on the scalp.
  Some of the medications used in scalp psoriasis include:
    - Coal tar
    - Salicylic acid
    - Steroids
    - Vitamin D analogs
    - Calcitriol
    - Ketoconazole
    - Selenium shampoo
2. Phototherapy: This involves the use of ultraviolet light (UV) to help reduce scaling and inflammation.
3. Oral medications: These may be used in more severe cases of scalp psoriasis, and include medications such as:
    - Methotrexate
    - Acitretin
    - Fumaric acid
    - Selenium
    - Biologic agents (such as Humira, Stelara, Raptiva, etc.)
Note: Medications may be prescribed by a dermatologist, and it's important to follow instructions carefully and not to stop treatment abruptly.","1. As per your history, you are suffering from scalp psoriasis, I will recommend you to try out topical therapies first. 
2. Topical therapies include use of steroids and/or topical Vitamin D analogs.  
3. Steroids help in reducing the inflammation and itching associated with scalp psoriasis. 
4. Topical Vitamin D analogs slow down the growth of skin cells. When used in combination with steroids, they help in better management of scalp psoriasis.
5. Oral therapies include use of immune-modulating medications such as methotrexate, a retinoid such as acitretin, or biologic agents such as alefacept, efalizumab, or ustekinumab.  
6. Phototherapy with ultraviolet light (UV-B) can also be used to manage scalp psoriasis.
7. Scalp psoriasis is difficult to treat because the scalp is a difficult site for topical treatment and systemic side effects from medication can be particularly troublesome.
8. I would also suggest you to try out some natural remedies for scalp psoriasis such as use of olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, etc. which can help in alleviating the symptoms of scalp psoriasis.
9. However, treatment options for scalp psoriasis are the same as for other body sites. The choice of therapy will depend on the severity of the disease, the area affected, and the patient's general health status.","1. Since scalp psoriasis can be quite resistant to treatment, I would recommend that you see a dermatologist for treatment.
2. Medications: Since scalp psoriasis is usually resistant to treatment, it is best treated with oral medications.   
- Oral vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol (or calcipotriene for plaque psoriasis) can be effective for scalp psoriasis. 
- Oral corticosteroids can also be effective, but long-term use can cause side effects.
- Other oral medications that can be effective for scalp psoriasis include methotrexate, apremilast, and other biologics.
3. Application of medications: Your dermatologist will prescribe a medication, which will usually come in the form of a cream or ointment. 
- For scalp psoriasis, it is best to apply the medication directly to the affected area in the evening, after washing and drying the hair. Leave it on overnight, and then wash it off in the morning. 
- Some medications, such as vitamin D analogs, can be irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes, so it is important to avoid contact with these areas. 
- It is best to avoid applying the medication to unaffected skin or to skin that does not have psoriasis, as this can cause side effects such as skin irritation, discoloration, or lightening/darkening of the skin.
4. Use of topical medications: In addition to prescription medications, some topical medications such as topical steroids, vitamin C, or other topical antioxidants can be helpful in alleviating symptoms of scalp psoriasis. 
- However, it is important to avoid using topical medications that are not recommended by a dermatologist, as these can sometimes worsen or cause side effects such as skin irritation or discoloration.
5. Use of phototherapy: Phototherapy, such as the use of ultraviolet light or photochemotherapy, can be effective for some cases of scalp psoriasis, but it is important to discuss this option with","1.

"1.Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix. Cervicitis can be caused by infection, desquamative, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions.

2.Non-infectious causes may include:

-Physical trauma
-Sexual trauma
-Allergic reactions
-Autoimmune disorders
-Pharmaceuticals

3.The presence of cervicitis can be asymptomatic or present with abnormal vaginal discharge, pain, and intercourse.

4.There are several laboratory tests that can be performed to diagnose the underlying cause of cervicitis, such as:

-Gram stain and culture of urethral discharge
-Cervical culture and sensitivity
-Phenotypic and genotypic identification of microorganisms in urethral discharge

5.Yes, cervicitis can cause infertility due to damage to the cervix and altered genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of microorganisms.

6.It is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of cervicitis and administer appropriate treatment.","1) Yes, Non-infectious cervicitis can cause infertility if it leads to cervical blockage (which is more likely if there is also concomitant pelvic inflammatory disease (PD)).
2) Tampon use causes cervicitis because the foreign body reaction to the tampon, which is left in for hours to days at a time, causes chronic inflammation of the cervix. This is a common cause of chronic cervicitis and can be treated by removing the tampon as a possible cause and treating the resulting inflammation.
Other potential causes of chronic cervicitis include:
-Unknown cause
-Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
-Prolonged viral cervicitis
-Immunologic causes
-Reactions to spermicides
-IUDs
-Allergens

Treatment for cervicitis is typically antibiotics, although in your case since you've already received treatment for over a year and a half and it hasn't worked, something else may be going on. You should talk to your doctor about possibly removing the tampon use as a possibility and getting tested for other causes. If it is determined that cervicitis is from an STI, you will need to treat that in order to resolve the cervicitis. If it is determined as unknown cause, it is possible that you may have a low immune system, in which case your doctor may check for immunologic causes.","1) Cervicitis is inflammation of the cervix. Non-sexually transmitted cervicitis (NSC) is caused by various factors like tampon use, allergic reactions, chemicals, etc.2) NSC does not lead to infertility. In fact, NSC itself is a result of another problem that is not diagnosed.3) In case of tampon use, the cause is obvious. Tampons cause irritation.4) Please stop using tampons. Use maxi pads instead. Use of maxi pads will heal the cervix. If you have further queries, please let me know so that I can help you further. Wish you good health.","1) Yes, untreated cervicitis can lead to infertility.
2) The specific factor in tampons that cause inflammation is the fiber content. Most tampons are rayon based which is known to cause irritation and inflammation when left in for long periods of time. There are other options such as cotton tampons and menstrual cups which do not contain rayon and are therefore better tolerated.","1. Chronic cervicitis is a common cause of female infertility.
2. Non-sexually transmitted cervicitis is caused by tampon use due to a hypersensitivity reaction to the tampon fibres.
3. The inflammation leads to cervical hostility, which means that the cervix does not allow the sperm through to the uterus to fertilise an egg.

The standard treatment for chronic cervicitis is a course of antibiotics such as doxycycline. If this does not work, then a hysteroscopy and biopsy may be required to identify any abnormal cells and remove them. It is also important to identify any sexually transmitted infections.

In addition to cervicitis, there are many other causes of female infertility, and it's important to investigate any other symptoms that may be present, such as irregular periods, pelvic pain, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovarian cysts, and fibroids.

It is also important to consider male infertility factors, such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and sperm antigens.","1. ""Cervicitis due to tampon use"" - this is probably the cause of your problem, although as you said, it's unusual to have such long-term inflammation.  Tampon use can cause inflammation of the cervix, which can cause infertility, as sperm cannot penetrate through the inflamed cervix to the uterus. 

2. The inflammation can also cause problems with implantation of a fertilized egg, even if the cervix is open. 

3. The cause of the inflammation in your case could be related to an allergic reaction to the tampon material. 

4. I would suggest you stop using tampons, and see if this helps with the problem. You can use a diaphragm instead, which is safer. 

5. If you want to get pregnant soon, you should see a fertility specialist, who can do a complete evaluation of your condition. 

6. I hope this helps!"
"15 years is a long time to have ""growing pains"", but if your doctor of that time was correct (and you don't give reasons to doubt his competence) then you probably do have growing pains. You are probably outgrowing a growth plate in the hip, causing occasional pain as the nerves and other tissues have to be stretched a bit. Such pain is easily relieved by milk, since the pain is probably due to compression of the nerves by the growth plate, and milk can help with that.  The pain may last for years, since the growth plate doesn't usually completely disappear until the early 20s. Just be thankful that it isn't worse, since some people have much more serious problems with their growth plates. Since it's so long, you probably won't find a cause, and it will likely resolve on its own.","15 years is a long time to have growing pains. If he attributed it to that originally, he should reevaluate. Hip pain is fairly common, and can be caused by a lot of different things. He should check for basic things like an atlas disparity, check your hips for dysplasia, and order an x-ray for you. 
If all that checks out normal, he should order an MRI to check for femoral nerve entrapment, or other structural abnormalities. 
I would also recommend you find a physical therapist to help you with stretching and strengthening exercises. A lot of hip pain can be helped with simple stretching and strengthening.","1. If your doctor ruled out possible causes, like a tumor or nerve entrapment, and thinks it's just growing pains, then I would agree that there is nothing to seek further medical attention for. Growing pains are completely normal and usually resolve spontaneously with age.2. However, if the pain is still occurring, then I would start with conservative management, like stretching exercises, massage, and over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If this doesn't help, then if it's still bothering you, you can seek further medical attention.3. I would also encourage you to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet, which can improve symptoms.4. If you have psychological stress or anxiety, these can also worsen symptoms, so it might be beneficial to seek additional help from a counselor or therapist.","15 years is a long time to have pain, swelling or numbness in any area.  I would definitely have it checked out.  Growing pains usually go away as you grow.  Since this has not gone away, it would be worth having a doctor take a look at it.

Hope this helps.","15 years is a long time to have growing pains. If it is only hip pain, and numbness I would think it is probably benign. But it would be good to have an exam to see if there is any sign of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. That is Osteonecrosis of the femoral head. It would show as a narrowing of the femoral neck on x-ray and would explain the numbness. If there is no narrowing then it is probably benign. Good luck.","15 years is a long time, and while it may be growing pains, it may also be a stress fracture, which can take a long time to heal, and may never heal completely.  If you are having pain and numbness, it might be related to a pinched nerve, which can have many causes.  The doctor might look at your spine, and see if there are any signs of scoliosis, which also can cause hip pain.  You might want to try physical therapy, which can help strengthen the muscles around the hip, and possibly reduce pain.  You might also want to get a bone density test, to make sure that you are not suffering from osteoporosis."
"There are no specific CT scan findings associated with diverticulosis. However, a CT scan is helpful in differentiating diverticulitis from other diseases that cause abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting like acute appendicitis, small bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal bleed, neoplasms etc. In diverticulitis, the CT scan findings are based on the severity of the disease. The common CT findings associated with diverticulitis include:  
Peri-diverticular abscesses Thickening of the diverticular wall Segmental collapsed bowel Diffuse mucosal fold thickening with intramural gas Contrast CT enteroclysis findings in case of obstruction due to diverticulitis include:  Duodenal obstruction Dilated stomach and proximal duodenum","CT is the preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, however, a negative CT does not exclude the diagnosis. In cases of diverticulitis especially when the infection is mild, the CT may be negative since the infection may be confined to the colon wall. In such cases the CRP levels may be elevated. Other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of diverticulitis include, Tubercular gastroenteritis, infectious colitis, Whipple's disease, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, and malignancy. It is important to consider these conditions in the differential diagnosis of diverticulitis. A positive CT in diverticulitis depends on the severity of the infection. In cases of diverticulitis, the colon wall may be thickened, have areas of necrosis, or have abscesses.","No, CAT scans are typically not helpful in diagnosing diverticular disease. Diverticulosis is usually only picked up on colonoscopy, while diverticulitis is typically diagnosed with abdominal pain, bloody stools, and fever (in which case a CT with contrast is more helpful).","CT can be used to differentiate between diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Diverticulosis is the presence of diverticula without inflammation, while diverticulitis is the presence of diverticula with inflammation. On CT, diverticulosis is characterized by the presence of diverticula, while diverticulitis is characterized by the presence of diverticula, abscess, and thickening of the colon segments. In addition, CT can be used to evaluate the severity of diverticulitis, as well as to detect complications such as abscesses, fistulae, and perforation.","No, a CAT scan will not show diverticulosis or diverticulitis if there's no infection at the time of the scan. A CAT scan, which stands for computed axial tomography, is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays and computer technology to create detailed images of internal organs and tissues. While CAT scans can be useful for diagnosing and monitoring a range of conditions, including diverticulitis, they are only useful if there is evidence of inflammation or infection present. In the case of diverticulitis, a CAT scan may show evidence of inflammation and infection in the colon, such as abscesses or inflamed tissue. However, if there is no active infection or inflammation at the time of the scan, a CAT scan would likely show a normal colon. In such cases, other diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or stool tests, may be necessary to further evaluate the patient's condition.","CT-scan is the best imaging modality for diverticular disease diagnosis. It can diagnose diverticulosis as well as diverticulitis. CT-scan doesn't only diagnose diverticular disease, but it can also determine the severity of the disease (the presence of abscesses, the presence of obstruction, etc.). In short, yes, diverticulosis or diverticulitis can be identified on a CT-scan even when there's no ongoing infection."

According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, ""there is an ointment that can be applied to the mucosa that will help provide some relief, but it should only be used after consulting with a dentist or doctor because over use can cause more problems than it solves."" 

The ointment they are referring to is called ""XYLIVAN,"" and it is available online and in some medical supply stores. It is intended for use by patients who have ""dry mouth"" as a result of radiotherapy or some medications.

It is important to note that before using any ointment or medication for dry mouth, you should talk to your doctor or dentist. That's because some oral medications or ointments can actually make dry mouth worse, or even increase your risk of oral infections.

The first thing that comes to my mind is HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). 
You must start by changing your lifestyle. 
- Losing weight
- Avoid food that trigger heartburn
- Eat in peace without being disturbed
- Eat slowly
- Avoid lying down right after eating
- Keep a healthy diet rich in fiber and vitamins
- Don't eat anything 2-3 hours before bedtime
- Avoid food that trigger heartburn such as: spicy food, citrus fruits and juices, tomato-based foods, soda, coffee, chocolate, mints, watercress, celery, onions, garlic, mustard, ketchup, hot sauces.
You can also get your own antacid, like Di gene, Tecta, or any antacid that contains Alginic acid 162.5 mg, Simethicone 125 mg, and Magnesium Hydroxide 162.5 mg, you can take it when heartburn occurs.

If you are not hungry, and you are worried about not eating enough, then the first thing to do is lose weight.  You say you have anxiety and heartburn, but you don't say you have too much stress or provide any other details.  It sounds like you might be overweight, and your anxiety is related to your weight.  

2. Change your diet

Next, you should change your diet.  Cut out all the junk food and food that gives you heartburn.  Instead, eat foods that are good for your heart.  For example, eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.  You should also cut out drinks that contain caffeine or alcohol.  Instead, drink water.  Try to eat small meals throughout the day instead of three large meals.  

3. Exercise

You should also exercise.  Start out slow, but try to exercise for at least thirty minutes every day.  Exercise will help reduce your stress, improve your mood, and give you more energy.  As you start losing weight, you will want to exercise even more.  

4. Get a check-up

Lastly, you should get a check-up with your doctor.  Your lack of appetite, heartburn, and anxiety could be related to a medical condition.  Your doctor can run some tests to make sure everything is okay.  Your doctor can also prescribe medication for your anxiety or heartburn.

"The risk of you developing HELLP syndrome depends on whether you have risk factors or not. Some of the risk factors are obesity, age more than 30, pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, thrombocytosis, certain genetic disorders, multiple pregnancies etc. A careful evaluation can help you know whether you are at risk or not. It is always advisable to be cautious and careful during pregnancy especially in high risk women.","If your sister experienced HELLP syndrome during her first pregnancy, you may be at increased risk for developing it during yours. HELLP syndrome is a severe version of preeclampsia that can occur during pregnancy and is caused by liver and platelet problems. It can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby. While it is not common to have HELLP syndrome in more than one pregnancy, women with a history of the condition in a previous pregnancy are at a higher risk for developing it again. It is important to discuss any concerns about HELLP syndrome or other pregnancy-related complications with your healthcare provider, especially if you have a history of these conditions in previous pregnancies.","When a woman has HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets) in one pregnancy, she is at a greater risk of having it in future pregnancies. It is estimated that the risk is about 1 in 4. However, some studies show that the risk may be as high as 1 in 2.

Regardless of whether you have a history of HELLP or not, it is important to be vigilant for signs of the condition during your pregnancy. Symptoms of HELLP may include:

*Severe headache
*Blurred vision
*Nausea and vomiting
*Fatigue
*Lower abdominal pain
*Changes in liver function tests

If you think you may have HELLP, call your doctor immediately.","Your risk of developing HELLP syndrome depends on whether or not your sister had the severe or mild form of the syndrome.  The risk also depends on whether or not she had symptoms at less than 20 weeks gestation.  If your sister had the severe form of HELLP syndrome at less than 20 weeks gestation, your risk of developing SEVERE HELLP syndrome is 1 in 4.  If your sister had the mild form of HELLP syndrome at less than 20 weeks gestation, your risk of mild HELLP syndrome is 1 in 16.  If your sister had the severe form of HELLP syndrome at more than 20 weeks gestation, your risk of HELLP syndrome is 1 in 38.  If your sister had the mild form of HELLP syndrome at more than 20 weeks gestation, your risk of HELLP syndrome is 1 in 100.","There is evidence that relatives of patients with pre-eclampsia have an increased risk of developing the syndrome themselves.

"8-year-old child with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and autism
I understand how difficult it is for them to accept the diagnosis of autism for their child. But, if the child has been diagnosed with autism, then, the symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder in the child, can only be due to the child's autism.
There is no need to separate the child from parents at this stage. With the progress in ABA therapy, there are good chances that the child will be able to lead a normal life with parents at home. Please do not agree with anyone who wants to keep the child away from parents.
Regarding the facility, where they want to keep the child, please do not agree, unless you are convinced that it is in the best interest of the child.","I am sorry to hear about your friends' situation. It sounds very difficult for them, and my heart goes out to them.

Unfortunately, as a doctor, I am not allowed to recommend specific institutions or facilities. This is because different institutions specialize in different treatment modalities, and what is an excellent fit for one patient may not be an excellent fit for another.

However, I would be happy to talk about treatment options that are available to your friends. To start with, there are treatment options that involve psychostimulant medications, which can help with some of the symptoms of both Oppositional Defiant Disorder and autism. Additionally, there are forms of therapy such as applied behavioral analysis, which has been shown to be very useful in dealing with some of the symptoms of autism.

I would also recommend that your friends get in touch with one of the many advocacy groups, which can help them navigate the system and find the treatment options that are best suited to their particular needs.

I hope this helps. Please feel free to write back for more information, or to set up a consultation with myself or one of my colleagues. Best of health to your friend and his family.","8-year-old child diagnosed with both autism and Oppositional Defiant Disorder... they're being told to institutionalize him... can you recommend any exceptional institutions in the country that specialize in treating co-occurring ODD and autism?

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend any institutions for this child. I do not have the expertise to evaluate a child in this situation and make specific treatment recommendations. Additionally, as a doctor answering patient questions on this site, I do not have access to information about ""exceptional institutions"" in the country. I would recommend speaking with a trusted healthcare provider or mental health professional who can evaluate the child and make recommendations based on the specific circumstances.","I am sorry to hear about your friends' situation.  I can imagine how difficult this must be for them.

As you may know, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a range of conditions with a shared core of symptoms that affect a person's social and communication skills.  These may include:

Difficulty making eye contact or engaging in other typical social interactions
Difficulty communicating, both in terms of verbal communication and nonverbal cues like eye contact, reading emotions, and responding to social cues
Repetitive or ritualized behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, obsessively arranging and rearranging objects, engaging in repetitive movements or gestures, etc.)
Interests that are limited and repetitive
Difficulty with social interactions, including developing and maintaining friendships

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), on the other hand, is a diagnosis given to children who repeatedly and purposefully annoy others and blatantly break rules.

Thus, it may be difficult to find a program that caters specifically to children with both conditions.  However, there are likely programs that could work well for a child with ASD and/or ODD.  For example, a therapeutic boarding school or wilderness program may be able to work with a child with these types of diagnoses.  However, it is important to find a program that has experience working with children with special needs and that can provide a high level of individualized care.

If you would like, I can help you find a program that might work well for your friends' son.  Please feel free to email me or call me at your convenience at 1-800-368-5202.","8-year-old child asperger syndrome autism oppositional defiant disorder

I don't know any highly reputed treatment center for this combination, however; you can look for treatment for autism and for oppositional defiant disorder separately.
For autism, applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the most widely accepted treatment.
For oppositional defiant disorder, psychotherapy and psychoactive medications such as risperidone are used.
However, before starting any treatment, it is necessary to get a proper evaluation by a psychiatrist.","I am sorry to hear about the difficult situation that your family is going through. As you have mentioned, the child has co-occurring autism and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. This certainly requires a specialized approach in terms of treatment and care. While institutionalization may seem like a viable option, it is important to explore all other alternatives before considering this route. 

There are a number of premier facilities and programs in the US that provide specialized care for children with both conditions. Some of these include the New Horizons Medical Center in California, the The River Source in Arizona, the Recovery Inn in Tennessee, and the Seabrook in New York. These facilities offer comprehensive treatment and care for patients with a range of mental health conditions. They employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, psychotherapy, and other forms of treatment. It may be worthwhile to explore these options and other similar programs to determine the best course of action for the child in question. 

It is important to note that the ultimate decision regarding the child's treatment and care should be made by a qualified mental health professional, taking into consideration the child's unique circumstances and condition. While national guidelines and evidence-based treatments can provide a useful framework for decision-making, the specific treatment plan should be tailored to the child's individual needs."
"70-80% of his intestine dead seems like a lot, but it depends on the underlying disease causing the ischemia(lack of blood supply). If there was a severe embolism(blood clot), it could be possible. Otherwise, it seems a little far-fetched. Usually, a section of the intestine just plain dies, usually due to lack of blood supply, and this is called an infarcted segment. If enough intestine is infarcted(or dead), it can cause a catastrophic event called an abdominal septic shock, which can lead to death. It seems like this is what happened to your father-in-law. I hope this answered your question.","It is very reasonable.
 
The cause of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is unknown. It is thought that a bacterial infection may start the process, but the exact cause is unknown.
Anyway, the disease starts quite suddenly. It is common in premature babies, but can also happen to healthy babies.
The death of intestinal tissue happens quickly over 1-3 days.
Usually, the first symptom is severe gastrointestinal distension.
According to the textbook ""Surgical Diseases of the Breast, Abdomen and Pelvis"", by M. H. Greer (page 718):

The clinical presentation of NEC is characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms, including persistent, severe abdominal distension, feeding intolerance with projectile vomiting, and bloody, foul-smelling diarrhea.

It is a serious disease and death rates in premature babies can be high.
Treatment is usually surgical, and the death of intestinal tissue necessitating emergency surgery can happen quite quickly if the disease is severe.
If the intestinal tissue is not completely dead, but inflamed, the condition is called necrotizing enteritis (NEC). This is usually less severe and can be treated with antibiotics.
In healthy adults, an interruption in blood supply to the intestine (bowel ischemia) can cause a similar condition, called bowel infarction or necrosis. This is also a medical emergency.
If a healthy adult were to suffer a sudden blockage of a bowel area, they would probably experience severe abdominal pain and go to the hospital. If it took three days to diagnose the problem and get the blockage fixed, the consequences could be very serious.
If the blockage were caused by a twisting of the intestine (volvulus), it could take only a few hours before the intestine might start to die.
In cases of known bowel ischemia, the death of tissue occurs over 1-3 days.
I could not find a case report of a healthy adult with rapid death of intestinal tissue without any",70-80% of small intestine and part of the large intestine had to be removed? That is absolutely catastrophic! I am sorry for your loss.,"It's extremely rare, but possible. There are cases of acute necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) that result in such extensive damage. For example, see this case report:
Van der Starre et al. A case report of acute necrotizing enterocolitis causing extensive small intestine necrosis. Journal of Pediatric Surgery. 2005.
  As the abstract explains:

Because of extensive necrosis, an extensive resection was necessary. After an abdominal exploration, a large portion of the small intestine and the ascending colon had to be removed because of the extensive necrosis. The child survived.

The typical cause of NEC is an imbalance of bacteria in the gut, often due to the use of antibiotics or reduced immunity.","It started as abdominal pain, which prompted a visit to the ER. The patient was diagnosed with acute mesenteric ischemia - a severe form of intestinal ischemia that results from poor blood supply to the intestines. 

This is what happens in severe cases of mesenteric ischemia:

The initial diagnosis in this case was ""mesenteric ischemia"", but the cause of the ischemia was not discovered. In fact, the cause of mesenteric ischemia could be any of a number of conditions that result in reduced blood flow to the intestines. The most common cause is atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries (the ones that supply the intestines), but others include thromboembolism (blood clots), low blood pressure, and hypercoagulable states (conditions in which blood tends to clot more than normal).

The treatment for mesenteric ischemia is to get the blood flowing properly to the affected organ again. This can be done by unclotting the blood (thrombolysis), by giving blood itself, or by surgery.

In this case, emergency surgery was required to remove the affected bowel, which was necrotic (dead) due to lack of blood supply. The extent of bowel removed was significant - 70-80% of the small intestine, which is a tremendous amount.

The patient's sudden appearance of health on Monday after such extensive surgery on Saturday is a mystery to me. Perhaps they had a tremendous amount of compensatory intestinal motility, or perhaps the remaining intestine underwent significant dilation. I don't know if the patient had a colostomy, in which case the appearance of health might be more understandable (although still pretty impressive).

So the answer to the question, ""How could someone who appeared healthy on Saturday end up needing an emergency surgery to remove a large portion of their intestine, including 70-80% of their small intestine, just two days later?"" is ""Acute mesenteric ischemia"".","It's not only possible, it's common. The bacteria that are present in food that is mishandled (such as left out at room temperature for more than 2 hours, or contaminated by raw meat or poultry) can cause illness within 20 minutes to 1 day after eating or drinking.

Symptoms can include:

Abdominal cramps Dehydration Diarrhea Fever Nausea Vomiting

Depending on the severity of the infection, the progression of symptoms can happen rapidly, as in your example.

In most cases, the illness lasts 3–4 days. Most people will recover without treatment. However, in some cases, a severe infection may lead to severe dehydration and other serious complications. The main treatments for food poisoning are:

Replacement of fluids and electrolytes (such as sodium) through an intravenous line (by vein) Replacement of potassium through a vein Antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection

Initiation: The effect of carcinogen on the cell is limited to a specific area
Progression: The affected area undergoes microscopic invasion
Histologic: The cells invade the surrounding tissue

2. Cervical dysplasia is the abnormal growth of cells in the cervical region. Cervical dysplasia is not cancer. However, it is a pre-cancerous lesion and a potential precursor to cervical cancer. Cervical cancer arises when the cells in the cervical region become cancerous due to progression of cervical dysplasia.

3. Cervical dysplasia is classified into 3 grades:

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I, II, III)
Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)
Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)

4. Cervical dysplasia is commonly detected through routine Pap smears. Colposcopy may also be used to detect cervical dysplasia.

Diabetes mellitus (DM), a metabolic disease, result from inadequate insulin secretion or its action, or both. The common causes of diabetes mellitus include insufficient insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells due to destruction by immune system (impaired insulin secretion), the absence of insulin secretion due to the absence of the insulin- secreting cells (imperfect insulin secretion), impaired insulin action due to the resistance of the tissues to the action of insulin (impared insulin action) and the presence of none or little insulin in the body due to the destruction by the immune system (imperfect insulin secretion). 
Common symptoms of diabetes mellitus include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and fatigue. The diagnostic studies of diabetes mellitus include fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and random plasma glucose (RPG). The main goal of treatment of diabetes mellitus is to lower the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level to reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. 
The medical therapy of diabetes mellitus is depended on the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β-cells or its action. The pharmacological therapy of diabetes mellitus includes insulin therapy, oral antihyperglycemic agents, and non-insulin-dependent antihyperglycemic agents.
Surgical therapy of diabetes mellitus includes gastric bypass surgery, which is recommended for patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) only.

The symptoms are pain and stiffness in the affected joint, which in this case is the knee. It gets worse after rest and better with movement. OA is diagnosed by a physical examination where the orthopedic doctor can feel the limits of motion and tenderness and swelling around the joint. X-rays are also helpful. Treatment is divided into conservative and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment is initially effective and includes: painkillers, physiotherapy and orthotics (special shoe inserts). 
Surgical treatment is performed when conservative treatment fails and includes:  Chondroplasty (reshaping of the damaged cartilage), osteotomy (reshaping of the bone), uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty (prosthetic knee joint implantation).

Sometimes you can associate a mutation with a specific disease, for example this paper shows that mutations in the PKD2 gene (which encodes for the kidney-specific isoform of fibrocystin) can cause polycystic kidney disease.
Sometimes you can associate a mutation with a specific cancer, for example this paper shows that 3p21.3, which contains the CDC20B gene, is frequently lost of patient-derived gastric cancer cells.
Sometimes you can associate a mutation with a specific gene, but not with a specific disease, for example this paper shows that a mutation in the TSC2 gene (which encodes for the tumor suppressor Hamartin) can cause tuberous sclerosis. However, they don't link this mutation with a specific disease.
Sometimes you can find a mutation associated with a specific disease, and know what the disease is, like in this example where a mutation in the NPHP1 gene (which encodes the eye-specific isoform of the neuronal proteasome component REEP1) can cause nephronophthisis.

So the answer is: it depends on the specific case.","Question: I've been living with an unexplained medical condition for some time now - is it possible to undergo genetic testing to identify a mutation without knowing the underlying illness?

Answer: 

Yes, it is possible to do genetic testing to identify mutations without knowing the underlying illness. However, it is difficult to say whether any testing will be done or not based on symptoms. There may be some testing that can be done based on symptoms, but most of the time, genetic testing is done because someone has a family history of a genetic condition or a known genetic mutation. Most of the time, the testing is done to see if someone has the mutation that is known to cause a certain condition in a family. Without that, testing is usually not done.","There are tests that can detect mutations in specific genes that are associated with disease, but to date there is no test that will look at all the genes and be able to tell you which ones have mutations in them. This is because there are thousands and thousands of genes and it would be very difficult to look for all of them. Also, not all mutations in all genes are known or associated with disease. There are tests that can detect ""variants of unknown significance"" but these are usually only recommended for people who have a family history of a genetic disorder or a child with a birth defect. If you think you have a genetic problem, you should talk to your doctor or a genetic counselor. They can help you decide which, if any, genetic tests would be helpful for you.","Question: Can genetic testing reveal a mutation even if the underlying illness is unknown?

Answer: Yes, genetic testing can reveal a mutation even if the underlying illness is unknown. Genetic testing is a laboratory test that examines the DNA, the genetic material of an individual. This genetic material is examined to look for mutations that may be associated with a specific disease. The mutation can be a change in one letter of the genetic code (single nucleotide polymorphism) or a larger segment of DNA can be affected. It is possible to do genetic testing without knowing the underlying illness, although this may be more difficult, especially if it is a rare disease. For common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes, genetic testing is available and can reveal mutations associated with the disease. However, for rare diseases, where little is known about the genetics, genetic testing may be more difficult."
"33 years old and not vaccinated against measles? I strongly recommend getting vaccinated, especially considering that he is still in the age group where getting infected with measles is possible (although the risk is lower compared to younger individuals). SSPE can occur after having measles (the older the individual is when infected with measles, the higher the risk of developing SSPE). Therefore, I would not only recommend getting vaccinated against measles, but also getting the blood test to determine whether your son has already been infected with measles (to make sure that he is protected against SSPE). I hope this helps.",It is very rare to see SSPE in a person who did not have the measles. SSPE is a rare complication of the measles. A person needs to have had the measles (either naturally or by vaccination) to get SSPE. A person who has not had the measles (either naturally or by vaccination) is not at risk for SSPE.,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""SSPE,"" but based on the context, I think you're referring to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is a rare, progressive, and usually fatal neurological disorder that can occur as a result of persistent infection of the brain by the measles virus.  

As a theoretical possibility, it's hard to say, but realistically, the risk is very low.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is very rare even in unvaccinated individuals (and in fact, most cases identified in the scientific literature occurred in children who had received the measles vaccine).  Moreover, the risk of developing subacute sclerosing panencephalitis after being infected with measles appears to be inversely related to the age at which a person contracts the disease: the younger a person is when infected, the higher the risk.  For example, one study found that the risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis after measles infection was 1 in 1,333 for children who contracted measles before they were 1 year old, 1 in 750 for children who contracted measles at age 1-4, 1 in 250 for children who contracted measles at age 5-8, and 1 in 100 for children who contracted measles at age 9-14.  Another study found an overall risk of 1 in 1,383.  

These numbers are based on hundreds or even thousands of observed cases worldwide.  The risk may be even lower now that measles vaccination is more widespread, but even so, given the devastating nature of the disease, I would not want to be the subject of a scientific study (or a patient's case study) in which I was inoculated with measles virus for the purpose of studying the risk of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in an adult unvaccated against measles.  

So, in my opinion, low though the risk may be, it's still way too high for me to recommend deliberate infection with a potentially fatal disease as a means of determining whether an adult is at risk for subacute s","1) I am not sure what SSPE is, but assuming it is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, this occurs very rarely in unvaccinated individuals.  2) In those vaccinated against measles, this condition is almost entirely preventable.  3) So while subacute sclerosing panencephalitis can occur in unvaccinated individuals, it is very rare, and is almost entirely preventable by vaccination against measles.","33 year olds were not born at the time of the first measles vaccine, so some 33 year olds were not vaccinated. However, almost everyone born after 1970 was vaccinated against measles. 

The disease is gone from the US, so the risk of SSPE is very low. 

There is more risk of SSPE in unvaccinated children in Europe and other parts of the world. 

Note: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a very rare complication of measles. It is not known exactly how many cases of SSPE there are in the world, but it is estimated that in Europe, there are about 5-10 cases of SSPE per year.

"Dear Concerned Parent,
I am sorry to hear about your daughter's brain lesion. You have asked a very important question. Unfortunately, it is not possible to definitely say whether your daughter's lesion is related to the use of Bendectin that you took during your pregnancies. There is not enough evidence to definitely say whether the use of Bendectin or any other medications/substances during pregnancy cause brain lesions in offspring. However, we do know that women who get pregnant when they are very young, or who have a history of delivering a baby with a neural tube defect (such as spina bifida) are more likely to have a child with a brain or spine lesion. So, your personal medical history could be a more relevant factor than the medications you took during pregnancy. 
I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions.","I was prescribed Bendectin during my first pregnancy from 1964-1967. I had 3 children, a son and two daughters. My son developed a brain tumor at age 7 and died at age 13.5. My older daughter has had seizures since age 14 and has had brain surgery and radiation. My younger daughter has had no issues to my knowledge. I have wondered if there is a connection with the Bendectin that I took during my first pregnancy and the brain tumors of my son and older daughter. Would like to hear from anyone else who has had a similar experience.","There are no similar cases where the outcome was positive. However, there have been lawsuits alleging a connection between Bendectin (a combination of vitamin B6 and an antihistamine) and brain tumors in children born to women who took the medication during pregnancy. The manufacturer of Bendectin no longer makes or markets this product. Women taking medications for nausea during pregnancy should discuss the risks and benefits of each medication with their doctor.","I just read your question and I wanted to reach out to you. I am so very sorry to hear about your daughter's diagnosis. It must be an incredibly difficult time for your family. While I cannot guarantee that I am correct in what I am about to write, I hope that it provides some amount of comfort.  
First, you mentioned that your third child developed a meningioma. This is a type of brain tumor. It is important to note that meningiomas are benign. This means that they do not spread to other areas of the body and are not life threatening. While surgery may be required to remove a meningioma, it is typically successful and does not result in significant morbidity or mortality.  
You also mentioned that your other daughter has been diagnosed with a brain lesion. While you did not specify what type of brain lesion it is possible that it is not a meningioma. There are many types of brain tumors and many are malignant. This means that they can spread to other areas of the body and result in significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to recognize that brain lesions are serious and require immediate medical attention.  
It is important to note that while many medications have the ability to cause adverse effects such as birth defects and cancer, this does not mean that they always will. While the risk is low, it is not zero. This means that while medications like chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause meningiomas, it is not guaranteed. Additionally, while pregnancy itself can increase the risk of certain birth defects, it is not guaranteed.  
While it is impossible to say whether or not your pregnancy with Bendectin caused your daughter's condition, it is important to recognize that many women take Bendectin and do not have children with brain lesions. It is also important to recognize that pregnancies that go untreated can also result in significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the baby.  
It can be difficult to process a diagnosis like your daughter's. It is important to reach out for support. You may find that speaking with a therapist or support group may be helpful. It is also important to recognize that while we do not have a cure for brain lesions, we do have treatments that can help to","Dear worried mom,
I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's brain tumor. 
At the moment, there is no established connection between Bendectin use and brain tumors in children. Multiple studies have been done over the years, but no significant correlation has been found (see references 1 and 2). However, this doesn't mean that more studies couldn't be done that show a connection.
But even if Bendectin did cause brain tumors, it doesn't mean that all children born to women who took Bendectin will develop brain tumors. Not every pregnant woman who takes Bendectin will have a child with a brain tumor. It is a rare occurrence, if it occurs at all.
Please don't spend too much time worrying about this. Your doctor will keep an eye out for any changes in your daughter. If there are any changes, your doctor will be able to detect them early and start treatment.
Please take care of yourself. Eat healthy, exercise regularly, get enough rest, and don't worry too much.
Sincerely, 
Dr. H","There are no studies that can provide an answer to your question. There are case reports though, where women with brain tumors had taken bendectin (a synthetic form of pyridoxine, a vitamin) during pregnancy. Bendectin, was withdrawn from the market in 1977 due to possible association with brain tumors in children.
You may read these case reports 1, 2.
In one of them, the women who had taken bendectin, had developed a brain tumor 14 years after the pregnancy.
So it is impossible to say whether the tumor was caused by bendectin.
First of all, there is no proven link between bendectin and brain tumors.
Secondly, there is a long latency period.
Thirdly, there is no way to determine whether the tumor would have developed without exposure to bendectin.
Many other factors, like genetic factors, cancers in the family, etc., may have contributed to the tumor.

"Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia are two different names for the same condition. It is a form of dwarfism in which the bones of the limbs are abnormally short.

It is distinguished from other forms of dwarfism by the particular bones that are affected. In metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, the bones of the hands and feet are affected, while in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, the bones of the trunk and limbs are affected.

The two conditions are identical, however, and the difference is one of labeling and nomenclature, rather than a true difference in the condition.

Embryonic differentiation between the two forms cannot be accomplished prenatally, although postnatal differentiation can be accomplished by examination of the particular bones that are affected.","Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia are both rare genetic disorders that affect bone growth and development. They can be differentiated prenatally by ultrasound.

Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by short stature, shortened limbs, and a large head. Metatropic dysplasia, on the other hand, is characterized by normal stature, shortened limbs, and a normal-sized head.

In spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, the ultrasound will show shortened long bones, particularly in the legs. In metatropic dysplasia, the ultrasound will show normal length long bones.

It is important to note that these are just general differences, and that each disorder is unique and should be diagnosed and treated according to its specific symptoms and characteristics.","1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia are two types of dwarfism, but they are differentiated by their characteristic features. 

2. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by short (rhizomelic) extremities, a short trunk, and a beaked nose. In contrast, metatropic dysplasia is characterized by long (rhizomelic) extremities, a relatively normal trunk length, and a prominent forehead.

3. Prenatal differentiation can be achieved by analyzing the fetal ultrasound. In spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, the fetus will have short extremities and a short trunk, while in metatropic dysplasia, the extremities will be long and the forehead will be prominent. However, it is important to note that fetal ultrasound cannot diagnose these conditions with certainty, and further testing will be needed after birth to confirm the diagnosis.","Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia differ in their manifestations, with the former having more severe shortening of the 4th toe and the latter having more severe brachydactyly. Prenatal differentiation can be achieved by analyzing the pattern of limb development, with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia exhibiting a more severe shortening of the 4th toe and metatropic dysplasia exhibiting more severe brachydactyly. 

Context: You are a helpful doctor answering patient questions.","Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia are both skeletal dysplasias that can be distinguished prenatally by ultrasound. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by shortening of the ribs and vertebrae, while metatropic dysplasia is characterized by elongation of the ribs and vertebrae. Ultrasound can be used to measure the length of the long bones and compare them to normal values, allowing for prenatal distinction between these two conditions.","Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia are two forms of dwarfism.
  Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by short stature with very short arms and legs and joint problems that restrict mobility. Affected individuals also have a small head, a flattened face, and a prominent jaw (prognathism). Many of the bones in the face are also underdeveloped, and some babies with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia have breathing problems due to abnormalities of the windpipe. This condition is caused by mutations in the SHOX gene, and prenatal diagnosis is possible after 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy with an ultrasound or amniocentesis.
  Metatropic dysplasia, also known as short stature with short arms and legs (SSSWL), is characterized by short stature with very short arms and legs and joint problems that restrict mobility.

2) It is not harmful, but it may not be effective since the eardrum is not healed.

The eardrum is a membrane that separates the outer and middle ear. It can be damaged by injury, infection, or other causes.  When the eardrum is broken, it can be painful and may cause hearing loss.

To treat a broken eardrum, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics and recommend that the patient stay in that position for a few days.  Some people use ear drops and peroxide to try to help the healing process, but this is not proven to be effective.  Using peroxide can be harmful if it comes into contact with the eye or if too much is used.  However, using ear drops is generally considered safe.

In summary, using ear drops and peroxide for a broken eardrum is not harmful, but it may not be effective.  It is important to follow a doctor's recommendations for treating a broken eardrum."
"4 stages of kidney disease based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) :
Stage 1 : GFR higher than 90 mL/min) 
Stage 2 : (GFR between 60 and 89 mL/min)
Stage 3 : (GFR between 30 and 59 mL/min)
Stage 4 : (GFR less than 30 mL/min)
In congestive heart failure, kidney function usually deteriorates. The GFR falls leading to stage 4 kidney disease. This is called chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4.
With CKD more fluid is retained in the body. This leads to fluid overload. Fluid builds up in the lungs leading to shortness of breath. Excess fluid may also build up in the abdomen leading to pain and discomfort.
treatment includes :
1. Control of heart failure : This is the first step to prevent or slow the progression of kidney disease. This includes controlling fluid and salt intake, controlling blood pressure, controlling diabetes, and controlling cholesterol.
2. Treatment of kidney disease : This may include medicines to lower blood pressure, reduce fluid retention, control blood sugar or cholesterol, and take immunosuppressive therapy in case of rejection of transplanted kidney.
3. Dialysis : In case the kidneys have stopped working, dialysis can be used to artificially remove excess fluid and waste from the body.","1) The kidneys are important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. In congestive heart failure (CHF), the heart is not able to pump blood effectively. This can lead to fluid build-up in the body, including the kidneys. When kidneys are not working properly (stage 4 kidney disease), they are not able to get rid of excess fluid and filter the blood properly. This can lead to more fluid build-up in the body.
2) The combination of CHF and stage 4 kidney disease is a serious medical condition that can lead to further complications. It is important for individuals with this condition to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their symptoms and prevent further complications.

For more information regarding kidney disease and congestive heart failure, please see:

Stage 1: Kidney disease in which the kidney is slightly damaged but the functions are normal.

Stage 3: Kidney disease in which the kidney is moderately damaged with a moderate loss of function.
Stage 4: Kidney disease in which the kidney is severely damaged with a severe loss of function.

Each stage of kidney disease is associated with different symptoms, expected decline in GFR and laboratory abnormalities.

As CHF is a disease of heart, although there is reduced kidney function, but it is not stage 4, as there is no disease of kidney.
Hence, the answer is NO. It does not cause stage 4 kidney disease.

http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hf","1) Brief answer: Stage 4 kidney disease and congestive heart failure are both serious conditions that need immediate medical attention. Heart failure is associated with higher mortality and poor quality of life. Elevated blood pressure and fluid overload must be controlled to prevent heart failure. Kidney disease accelerates the progression of heart failure. A thorough cardiac and renal evaluation is necessary. 2) Detailed answer: Stage 4 kidney disease (KD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) are serious medical conditions that need immediate medical attention. KD is associated with higher mortality and poor quality of life [1, 2]. Elevated blood pressure and fluid overload must be controlled to prevent heart failure [3]. Kidney disease accelerates the progression of heart failure [4]. A thorough cardiac and renal evaluation is necessary. The effects of CHF on a person with stage 4 KD can be grouped into the following categories: i) fluid overload, ii) electrolyte imbalances, iii) mineral and bone disorder, iv) anemia, v) hyperkalemia, vi) hyperphosphatemia, vii) hypervolemia, viii) cardiac-renal syndrome, ix) non-pharmacological approaches.  Fluid overload: Both KD and CHF are associated with fluid overload [5, 6]. In stage 4 KD, the glomerular filtration rate is very low (less than 30 ml/min) [7]. Excess fluid accumulates in the body leading to generalized edema and increased preload. This further increases the workload on the heart and contributes to the development of CHF [8]. Electrolyte imbalances: Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with KD and CHF [9, 10]. In stage 4 KD, the kidneys are not able to excrete excess potassium and hydrogen ions causing hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis [7]. These abnormalities further increase the workload on the heart. Anemia: Anemia is common in patients with CHF and KD [11, 12]. The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells."

I hope this helps.","I think it largely depends on the cause of the stroke. If the stroke was caused by a cerebral hemorrhage, it would be contraindicated. The reason being that the cause of the stroke was bleeding and botox injection is a neurotoxin that could exacerbate the patient's condition. 

However, if the patient had an ischemic stroke, I think there is some evidence to suggest that botulinum toxin injections may improve motor function. 

A 2005 study published in the journal Stroke, entitled ""Subcutaneous BoNT/A Injection in Subacute and Chronic Phase Stroke Patients - A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial"", tested the efficacy of botox injections in patients with subacute and chronic phase stroke. The study found that patients who received the botox injections had significant improvements in motor function when compared to the placebo group. 

Another study, published in 2007 in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, entitled ""The Effects of Botulinum Toxin Type A on Muscle Spasticity in Subacute Stroke Patients"", found that botox injections significantly reduced spasticity and increased passive and active range of motion in subacute stroke patients.","I doubt it, I really do.  Botox is a protein A-B toxin that acts by binding to specific muscarin receptors on the motor end plate.  It's mechanism of action results in the inhibition of acetylcholine release, which in turn desensitizes the receptors and inhibits muscle contraction.  I don't know of any data indicating that it's L- L- L- lethal on brain cells.  In fact, it's FDA approved for things like hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), chronic migraines, and even cosmetic wrinkle reduction.  
However, I can't say in my expert opinion that I would recommend it for anything.  I'm not a big fan of using medications for things they were not approved for.  In fact, if a patient asked me if I thought botox would help them, I would tell them no, I don't think it would help them.  
There are other interventions that I would recommend for stroke rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy.  These are evidence based interventions that have been shown to improve the quality of life in stroke patients and in many cases improve motor function. 
So in closing, I would pass on the botox.",I am sorry to hear about your stroke and crippled left arm.  I am,"Botulinum toxin injections into the affected muscles may improve function in some patients. This treatment is still experimental, and results have been variable. Some patients have recovered more function following treatment with botulinum toxin than with other interventions, or they have shown a reduction in spasticity. The injections may need to be repeated. Because botulinum toxin injections are expensive, they may not be covered by insurance companies. You should check with your insurance company before starting this treatment.
Some patients have experienced an improvement in their speech following treatment of their arms. This is thought to occur because the treatment reduces spasticity, allowing for more normal movement of the arm, which in turn, allows for improved control of the mouth and tongue, which are needed for speech.
Physical therapy is still the most common treatment to improve function following a stroke. The injections may be used in addition to physical therapy, rather than in place of it.
http://www.strokecenter.org/physicians/faq/botox.htm","I am sorry to say, but the answer is NO.

BOTOX is a type of neurotoxin that can help reduce the muscle spasms, but it does not help in restoring the mobility. It is usually prescribed for patients who have strong muscle spasms that are preventing the normal functioning of the body.

The only treatment that can help improve the mobility is PHYSICAL THERAPY.

The physical therapist will put together a personalized recovery program for the patient based on the severity of the situation. The therapist will try to improve the coordination, balance, and mobility of the patient.

Also, regular exercises, healthy diet, and proper sleep patterns can help improve the recovery process."

I suggest you visit your GP to run some tests, such as a complete blood count, to check your platelet count and to see if there's an underlying disorder.","Vomiting can cause petechiae, but the fact that you are not feeling well and have these red spots under your chin could be due to something else. 

Petechiae are small, non-painful red or purple spots on the skin that are a size of a pinhead. They are a sign of thrombocytopenia or low platelet count. Petechiae occurs due to low platelet count because the platelets are necessary for blood clotting. 

Vomiting can cause petechiae due to the fact that vomiting puts pressure on the throat and esophagus causing small blood vessels to break and bleed. Vomiting also causes the stomach acid to come up and may also cause small ulcers in the esophagus which also cause bleeding. 

However, there are other reasons for those red spots under your chin. For example, allergies, an infectious disease, or even a tooth infection could be the cause of those red spots. Therefore, I would recommend you to see your dentist to help you identify the real cause of those red spots under your chin."

LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is a type of refractive surgery that is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism by reshaping the cornea. Cataracts, on the other hand, are a condition in which the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, causing blurred or impaired vision. While LASIK can be used to correct vision problems caused by refractive errors, it cannot correct the vision problems caused by cataracts. To treat cataracts, a doctor may prescribe new glasses or contact lenses, but the only way to remove a cataract is with surgery.

"Symptomatic relief for runny nose can be obtained by saline nasal Chat Doctor.  For headache, analgesics like paracetamol or ibuprofen are safe to take.  However, it is always better to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.","With Graves' disease, you should avoid taking any over-the-counter cold medicine with a runny nose and headache. The reason is because many cold medicines contain ingredients that can worsen hyperthyroidism, which is the underlying cause of Graves' disease. Instead, you should focus on treating the underlying hyperthyroidism through medication and lifestyle changes. A good first step is to see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.","Symptomatic treatment for runny nose and headache due to upper respiratory infection or allergy with intranasal decongestants, antihistamines, and acetaminophen is safe in Graves' disease.

Graves' disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. This can cause a range of symptoms including weight loss, weight gain, increased appetite and heartbeat, and anxiety. It also affects the immune system, so people with Graves' disease may be more susceptible to infections.

Cold and flu medications can have different effects on the body, so it is important for people with Graves' disease to talk to their doctor about the safety of these medications. Symptomatic treatment for runny nose and headache due to upper respiratory infection or allergy with intranasal decongestants, antihistamines, and acetaminophen is generally considered safe in Graves' disease. It is important to follow the instructions on the medication label carefully and not take more than the recommended dose.

"1) Revision THR is done when the original implant wears out or becomes loose, or there is an infection that needs revision surgery.
2) Revision surgery is relatively safe, but not as safe as primary THR. There are higher chances of dislocation, and the new implant may not last as long as a primary THR, and you may need another revision surgery later.
3) Yes, you can get a cementless revision joint, but only after a proper bone graft has been placed, which will help to prevent dislocation. Bone graft is taken from another part of your body, or from a donor.
4) Age is not a contra-indication for surgery. 66 is not very old. But you need to be fit enough to undergo general anesthesia and the stress of surgery. If you have other medical problems, it may be more risky. So it's best to get properly evaluated by your doctor.","1977 is a long time ago, and the Charnley total hip arthroplasty is an older type of surgery, so some of the bone in your hips may be ""end-plated,"" meaning the bone has grown into the surface of the implant over time.  This makes revision surgery (re-doing the surgery) more difficult, as there is a risk of damaging the good femoral head (the top of the thigh bone that the hip joint rotates around) in both hips, and end-plating also makes the hip more unstable.  Cementless stems may be an option in younger patients, but in your case, the Charnley stem is probably so incorporated into your bone that it cannot be removed.  Revision surgery is certainly possible, but your risk of complications is higher than a younger patient.  Nonetheless, I believe it is still a reasonable option for you, and I'd recommend consulting with an orthopedic surgeon to see if revision surgery is appropriate for you.","After a thorough clinical examination, it is advised not to go for a cementless revision surgery as it can lead to dislocation of the prosthesis. You should go for a cemented one as it is more stable. The safety and efficacy of revision surgery for total hip arthroplasty are well established. There is no age limit for undergoing revision surgery.","1. Revision THR is one of the most challenging orthopedic surgeries 
2. To my knowledge cementless stems are not recommended for revision surgery, as the bone quality and quantity in revision is not as good as primary (first time) surgery.","As with any surgery, anesthesia, surgical procedure and hospitalization carry some risks. The surgeon will evaluate your general health and anesthetic risk. The surgery can usually be done safely in a high-risk patient. The surgery can often be done without the need for bone grafts. The cementless stem can be inserted without cement. The new hip joint will not move or slip out of place. The new joint should last for 10 to 15 years.","66 years old! That is great. Unfortunately with THR done so long ago, your options are limited. Cementless stems are not recommended in a revision situation. The main problem with a long standing loose joint is the loss of bone stock. With a normal primary hip replacement the stem of the prosthesis is inserted into the femoral head and cemented in place. In a revision situation, there is often little bone remaining on which to secure a stem. Cementless stems are designed to be inserted into the canal of the femur and to integrate (osseointegrate) with the bone. The bone grows into the stem, providing a secure attachment. The problem is that in a revision situation, there may not be enough bone in which for the stem to osseointegrate. Revising to a cementless stem could loosen over time and displace. You need to find an experienced surgeon who can look at your femur and x-rays and let you know what your options are. I would not recommend any maneuver that could potentially worsen your already worn out joint."

"1.1 is not a very high level, so it is unlikely that the kidney stones are the cause of the slightly elevated level of creatinine. It is more likely that this is a ""normal"" level for you. Creatinine is a waste product that is normally excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys are not working well, creatinine levels rise in the blood. The level of creatinine can be used to follow kidney function in patients. Most laboratories have a normal range of 0.6 to 1.3. So, your level of 1.1 is really not so different from the normal range.
If you are having kidney stones, pain control and adequate fluid intake will help pass the stones. You may need medications to help the stones pass or surgery if the stones are large.  Chat Doctor.","1.1 is a slightly high serum creatinine level. It is just borderline high. So yes, it is possible that the kidney stone can cause further rise in the creatinine level and thus aggravate the renal function injury. 
It is important to know the exact details of the kidney stone, the treatment given, the treatment failures and the persistence of the symptoms. If the symptoms are persisting despite the treatment, you need a repeat examination, investigation and treatment. Sometimes, the treatment has to be escalated in terms of its aggression and magnitude.","1.1 what? It's not a complete question. You need to provide more context.

But, I can tell you that yes, it can. Creatinine is a waste product that is normally excreted by the kidneys. When you have a kidney stone, it can block the passage of the creatinine, leading to an increase in its levels in the blood.
But without knowing your age, gender, other medical conditions, etc, I can't provide you with an accurate answer.

I suggest you consult with your doctor about this. He/she can provide you with a more accurate answer after examining you and looking at your medical records.","1.  Creatinine is a waste product from muscle metabolism.  Since you are young, your muscles are probably in good condition.  This means your creatinine level is probably accurate.  1.1 mg/dL is actually low for your age.
2. Creatinine can be affected by kidney function.  Since you have kidney stones, there is a possibility that your kidneys are damaged.  This could cause your creatinine level to be higher than it really is.  However, this is unlikely since you are young and have a low creatinine level.
3. Since creatinine is made by muscles, having muscle damage (such as from a very strenuous workout) can cause a temporary increase in creatinine.  This does not seem to apply to you since you have a low level of creatinine and you don't feel muscle pain.
4. Finally, there is a genetic disease called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in which the creatinine level can be very high.  You don't mention having problems with urination or a history of mental illness, so this is unlikely to apply to you.
Conclusion: Since you are young and have a low creatinine level, it is most likely accurate.  It is unlikely that your kidney stones are affecting your creatinine level.  If you have pain or problems with urination, then further testing could be done to see if your kidneys are damaged.","1.1 mg/dL is not a high serum creatinine level and most likely is not related to the kidney stone. 

In fact, a recent review of the laboratory data of 6,000 patients with kidney stones did not find a single case with an elevated creatinine level.

Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by muscle metabolism and is excreted by the kidneys. A serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL is only slightly elevated and is consistent with a muscular individual that is not undergoing exercise training.

It is only when the serum creatinine level is above 2 mg/dL that most doctors become concerned and consider the possibility that the patient has a kidney problem.

In summary, having a kidney stone at the age of 36 does not affect your serum creatinine level, which is within the normal range.","1.1 mg/dL is a bit high, but not through the roof. It is in the ""normal"" range if you are referring to the 1.4 mg/dL ""reference limit"" for men, or the 1.2 mg/dL reference limit for women.

No, the presence of a kidney stone by itself would not cause a rise in serum creatinine. Creatinine is produced by the muscles and is excreted by the kidneys, so if your kidneys are functioning normally your serum creatinine should be about the same regardless of whether or not you have a kidney stone.

However, if the stone is large enough or in the right place it could cause some kidney damage which would result in a rise in serum creatinine over time. You don't mention any symptoms like pain or blood in the urine, so it sounds like the stone may be small enough to pass on its own (the 4mm rule).

If the stone does pass, you'll likely need to change your diet to prevent another one from forming. Foods with high oxalate content like spinach, nuts, and chocolate should be limited. If your serum creatinine continues to rise you may need to have it removed surgically.

As an aside, I didn't find your initial claim that a 36 year old with a serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL was ""a bit high"" to be all that accurate. While it is above the reference limit in women, it is within the normal range for a male of any age. I wouldn't worry about it, unless there are other symptoms present."
"1) It is possible that her symptoms are related to anxiety.  It is also possible that her symptoms are related to an underlying medical disorder.  You mentioned that she does not have a family history of heart disease, but a person can still have an underlying medical disorder that leads to heart disease.  For example, a person could have a genetic disorder that predisposes her to developing heart disease.2) The best course of action is to have her see a doctor (ideally a doctor that specializes in heart diseases and conditions).  The doctor will be able to run some tests and determine whether her symptoms are related to anxiety or an underlying medical disorder.  If it is determined that her symptoms are related to anxiety, then she will likely be referred to a mental health professional.  If it is determined that her symptoms are related to an underlying medical disorder, then she will likely be referred to a specialist for treatment.3) In the meantime, it is recommended that she avoids smoking and alcohol (if applicable), maintains a healthy diet and active lifestyle, and takes any medications that have been prescribed to her by a doctor.

The first thing that comes to my mind is Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia. It is important to remember that, although it is a disease of the elderly, it can occur in the early 60's, so it is not uncommon for a 84-year-old woman to have some degree of forgetfulness. The symptoms vary from person to person, but some of them include forgetfulness of recent events or conversations, forgetting names or appointments, misplacing items, difficulty performing tasks that require concentration, and confusion with time or place. A complete neurological evaluation by a specialist is necessary to diagnose this disease, which includes history taking, physical and neurological examination, laboratory tests, brain imaging (MRI, CT scan or head X-ray), and sometimes, neuropsychological testing. There are medications that can help slow down the progression of the disease, but early diagnosis and treatment is essential.

Therefore, the possibility of Lupus erythematosus (LE) is high.LE is a systemic autoimmune disease, which means it can affect any part of the body. The most common sign and symptom of LE is a skin rash, which is usually the first sign and symptom that a patient notices. The rash may appear anywhere on the body, but most often appears on the face, arms, and hands. The rash is often triggered by sun exposure. The most common signs and symptoms of LE include: Arthritis (joint inflammation), fever, fatigue, hair loss, mouth sores, skin rashes, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle pain. To confirm a diagnosis of LE, blood tests (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, and anti-Smith antigen) and tissue biopsy are needed. Therefore, you need to see a rheumatologist to get proper diagnosis and treatment. Hope this helps.","4 years is a long time to be sick without a clear diagnosis. I'm not an expert in autoimmune diseases, but from what I can gather, the symptoms you describe could be related to rheumatoid arthritis, but not necessarily lupus (which is a different type of disease).

It is impossible to say. Lupus is a diagnosis of exclusion, i.e. if all the other tests says no lupus, then it is no lupus. But there are lots of other diseases that can have similar symptoms. Only a thorough medical evaluation by a specialist can say something.
But the symptoms you describe are not necessarily related to lupus. Nausea and stomach discomfort can be related to many different things. Chronic fatigue is also not uncommon in many different diseases. So no, the symptoms do not necessarily have to be related to lupus. But as I said, only a thorough checkup can provide you with a definite answer.","Do you think this could be Lupus, even though I've tested negative for it before?

It is unlikely to be lupus. The most common and characteristic symptom of lupus is joint pain and swelling, often in a butterfly pattern (affecting both sides of the body). Fatigue is also a common symptom. Stomach pain and queasy feeling is not a typical symptom of lupus. Other symptoms that you have are not suggestive of lupus either. So, the possibility of lupus is very low.
The cause of your symptoms seems to be something else. Further details are needed to give a more specific answer.","4 years is a long period to have an autoimmune disease without a definite diagnosis. It is indeed strange that despite all the tests, the doctors have not been able to diagnose your disease. Lupus is a possibility, since it can affect various parts of the body, and the symptoms like pain, swelling, stiffness in feet and knees, and nausea and fatigue are seen in Lupus. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is to do the tests for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA antibodies and the complement levels in the blood. Also, the X-rays of the affected joints should be compared with the old ones to see any changes. The best way is to consult a rheumatologist, who will do all these tests and diagnose the disease properly. Once diagnosed, the disease can be treated specifically."
"50% of the recovery happens in the first 3 months
90% of the recovery happens in the first 12 months
the rate of recovery after 12 months is plateau-ed","The typical course of recovery after a stroke is slow at first, then it plateaus, and finally it improves.","It's important to note that not all stroke patients follow this exact pattern of recovery, and some may experience ""step down"" or ""step back"" patterns of recovery instead. It's also important to note that the rate of recovery can vary widely from person to person, and that some stroke survivors may never fully recover the use of the affected side. Regardless, the majority of stroke patients will progress through this general pattern of recovery.","""The typical pattern of rehabilitation following a stroke is some recovery during the first 3 months, followed by a plateau, then some recovery over the subsequent 3 months.""

Discussion: While many patients will show a steady recovery of function, others will show a more erratic pattern. This answer is a generalization and not necessarily applicable to all cases.","It depends on the size and location of the stroke.

It depends on the time to call 911 and the time to arrival of EMT.

It depends on the time to admission at the hospital and the time to do the CT scan and to find the diagnosis.

"1) The first thing that I would advise you is to get a stool examination for ova & cyst. This is to rule out an intestinal amoebas. If you are diagnosed with one, then the treatment for that is different.
2) The second thing that I would advise you to do is to go on an Elemental diet. This means that you will be on a diet of only Glucose polymer for 1 month. This is to heal the damaged lining of the intestine. After the 1st month, you can start to re-introduce other food.
3) For the dairy products, you can take lactose free milk and lactose free yogurt. As for the other diet, just avoid spicy food, and food that gives you gas, and you should be fine.","2 months of watery diarrhea is a long time and you need to be seen by a doctor who will try to identify the cause. In the meantime, since lactose-free milk and yogurt are natural and do not cause any reactions in the digestive system, they are safe to be included in the diet. Try to avoid other dairy, as well as caffeinated beverages and spicy foods, which can irritate the digestive system.","2 months of watery stools is long enough to be worrisome. You need to see a doctor, since the causes of watery diarrhea can be serious. It can be indicative of a bacterial infection, a parasitic infection, or an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease. Symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose the cause, and so you need medical tests. Lactose-free milk and yogurt should be fine, assuming you don't have a milk allergy, but you need a doctor to help you sort this out.","1. Dietary changes:

Limit intake of fat, especially animal fat.

Replace refined carbohydrates (e.g. white bread, most cereals, cooked rice) with whole grain carbohydrates (e.g. wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, brown rice).

Reduce intake of artificial sugars (e.g. sucrose, high fructose corn syrup) and caffeine.

2. Milk and yogurt: Lactose-free milk and yogurt are acceptable. However, if you are unable to digest lactose, which is a common cause of diarrhea, you may want to try an elimination diet to determine if removing dairy from your diet helps alleviate your symptoms.","1. There are many causes of watery diarrhea, including bacterial, viral, parasitic, and bowel-based causes.
2. For the bowel-based cause, you may try low-FODMAP diet, which stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Monosaccharides and Polyols.
3. These are carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in small intestine and can cause gas and bloating.
4. Low-FODMAP diet involves elimination of these foods for several weeks and reintroduction of each food one by one.
5. The most common high-FODMAP foods include apples, pears, onions, garlic, dairy products, honey, and certain grains.
6. Lactose-free milk and yogurt are usually well-tolerated and can be included in your diet.
7. However, I suggest you to avoid milk and milk products as milk sugar (lactose) is also a FODMAP.
8. Other foods that are well-tolerated and can help with diarrhea include bananas, white rice, boiled potatoes, and most meats.
9. Please consult your doctor for further testing and management if needed.","1. Dietary recommendations for chronic diarrhea include:

- Increased dietary fiber, such as through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Decreased animal protein
- Decreased fat and simple sugars
- Increased probiotics, such as through yogurt or supplements
- Lactose-free milk and yogurt are acceptable in the diet.

2. It is important to rule out potential causes of chronic diarrhea, such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.

"As an ophthalmologist, I can tell you that macular degeneration in only one eye is very rare. However, it can cause dizziness if the change in vision is significant enough to cause a loss of peripheral vision. The peripheral field is very important for our balance and spatial orientation. So, although it is rare, it is possible that macular degeneration in one eye can cause dizziness.","No, Macular degeneration in one eye alone will not lead to dizziness.  The macula is the center region of the retina which is responsible for sharp, detailed vision. The macula is a small area about the size of a pinhead that is located near the center of the retina. Macular degeneration is a painless eye condition which results in a slow loss of central vision. It never leads to dizziness. Dizziness in a patient with macular degeneration in one eye can be due to other medical conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, infection etc. Therefore, it is important to consult a physician to determine the cause of dizziness.","No, dizziness is not a common symptom of macular degeneration in a single eye. Macular degeneration is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision. It can cause gradual loss of vision, but it usually affects both eyes. Dizziness can be a symptom of many different conditions, but it is not typically associated with macular degeneration in a single eye. If you are experiencing dizziness, it is important to see a doctor for an evaluation to determine the underlying cause.","No, dizziness is not a possible effect of macular degeneration in only one eye. Macular degeneration is a common eye disease that affects the central part of the retina, called the macula. It can make it difficult to see fine details and perform tasks that require good central vision, such as reading, driving, or recognizing faces. While macular degeneration can affect both eyes, it usually does not affect both eyes to the same extent. If the disease is more severe in one eye than the other, it can create an asymmetric visual field defect, meaning that the vision in one eye is worse than the other. This can cause some difficulty with peripheral vision, but it should not affect balance or cause dizziness. In rare cases, macular degeneration can cause cerebral edema, which can lead to dizziness and other neurological symptoms. If you are experiencing dizziness, it is important to speak with your doctor to determine the underlying cause.","As the macular degeneration will affect both eyes, the answer is No. However, it can cause vision loss. The macular degeneration will cause damage to the macula which is responsible for central vision. Central vision allows to see objects in detail and perform tasks such as reading, driving and recognising faces.","¶ Yes, it can. The macula is part of the central vision, which is spatially restricted (unlike the peripheral vision, which has no clear center). A degeneration of the macula in one eye thus affects only that eye and does not cause dizziness. However, the brain adapts the vision from both eyes to compose a single, combined image (retinal correspondence). Degeneration of the macula in one eye can thus cause dizziness, imbalance, or other symptoms due to the brain's inability to accurately compose the visual image. The doctor should thus look for signs of brain adaptation, such as visual field constriction to the contra-lateral of the degeneration or other signs of visual bias."
"1. Yes, arrhythmias can occur after ablation, but they are usually transient.2. The success rate of ablation depends on the type of ablation, individual anatomy and underlying heart condition.3. The heart rate fluctuation you mentioned is probably a sinus tachycardia. It is not a serious finding. You should have a thorough evaluation of your heart condition though an electrophysiologist study.","1) Yes, though it is rare.
2) Typical success rate is > 90%.
3) Based on the information you provided, it is difficult to assess. A 24 hour Holter is insufficient to determine whether there are arrhythmias present. You would need to have a 30 day event monitor to see whether there are arrhythmias present.","1) It is possible, though rare, for ablation procedures to cause arrhythmias. The usual success rate of an ablation procedure is around 90-95%, depending on the type of ablation and the specific arrhythmia being treated.

2) Based on the information from your Holter test results, it is unclear what type of arrhythmia you are referring to. A heart rate fluctuation between 254 and 21 is likely an artifact (i.e. a technical problem with the Holter monitor). If the device was placed appropriately and is functioning correctly, then the heart rate should be a steady 254. If you are referring to a rhythm disturbance in addition to the heart rate fluctuation, then based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to evaluate. More detailed information about the rhythm disturbance (e.g. what did the electrocardiogram look like during the fast heart rate episodes?) and a description of the type of arrhythmia you are experiencing would help me evaluate your situation further.","1) Yes, ablation does increase the risk of developing arrhythmia. It is a deliberate, known risk of the procedure, as it may be necessary to induce arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation) in order to then revert it back to a normal sinus rhythm, in order to ascertain that all errant electrical circuits have been destroyed.
2) The average success rate of an ablation treatment depends on the kind of arrhythmia. As an example, the success rate for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is about 60-80% at 12 months, meaning that it is successful in preventing recurrence in around 60-80% of patients at 12 months post-procedure. However, there is no guarantee that it will work for you, as your case may be different from the average.
3) In light of your Holter test results, which showed a heart rate fluctuation between 254 and 21, I would describe it as highly abnormal. However, without knowing your clinical circumstances and the reason why such a test was ordered, it is difficult to interpret it further. It could be due to a number of things, including palpitations, to a serious medical condition. Please see your doctor for further evaluation and advice.","1. Yes, but it is rare.
2. The success rate of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation is over 90%.
3. Based on the results of your Holter test, it shows an irregular heart rate. This is not severe, as the heart rate is still within the normal range.","1) Yes, arrhythmias are a potential complication of ablation.
2) The success rate of ablation procedures is generally high, but it varies depending on the type of ablation, the indication, and the center performing it.
3) Based on the information in your question (a heart rate fluctuation from 254 to 21), I classify it as an irregular rhythm."

"1. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection caused by a poxvirus. It is a localized infection of skin, which means that it stays on the skin and does not spread to other parts of the body. It is most commonly seen in children and is spread by direct contact with the molluscum lesions. The lesions are typically multiple small depressions in the skin, about 1-2 mm in diameter that may be pink or flesh-colored. It is treated by various methods such as cryotherapy (freezing), electrosurgery, laser therapy, or topical medications. Some of the medications used to treat molluscum contagiosum include:Trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin resin for dipping or painting, which destroys the wart tissue. Cantharidin, which causes a blister to form around the wart. Retinoic acid, which is an acid made from vitamin A. Salicylic acid, which helps remove the wart. Silver nitrate, which is a chemical made from silver. It works by destroying the wart tissue. Other medicines used to treat warts include: Interferon, a medicine made from your own body proteins. Imiquimod, an immune-building medicine. Cryotherapy (freezing) is also used to treat warts. In this method, the wart is frozen with liquid nitrogen. Afterwards, the dead tissue of the wart falls off, usually within 2-3 weeks. Electrosurgery and laser therapy destroy the wart with an electric current or light. These treatments are more expensive than medicines, but they are quick and usually painless.

If these treatments are not desired or are not effective, small molluscum may be observed.","1. Tea tree oil: A 2013 study found that tea tree oil was effective in treating molluscum in children. In this study, 256 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years applied a 1% tea tree oil gel or a placebo gel to their lesions twice daily for 3 months. The tea tree oil reduced molluscum lesions by 85% at 2 months and 92% at 3 months, while the placebo had no effect. The study concluded that tea tree oil was an effective and safe treatment for molluscum in children.2. Iodine spray: Iodine has been used for decades as a topical treatment for molluscum.

This means avoiding things like caffeine, alcohol, and too much salt. Beyond that, there aren't any specific restrictions, and in fact, it may be beneficial to follow the exact opposite advice and drink plenty of water.

Water intoxication can be a problem in nephrology, because many patients are instructed to restrict fluid intake. Because these patients are already at risk for fluid overload, excessive fluid intake can cause serious complications, including death. However, in the general population, fluid restriction is not recommended and may even be harmful. One study found that fluid restriction in healthy patients was associated with increased all-cause mortality.

In fact, staying hydrated is especially important for patients with kidney disease, because even mild fluid depletion can impair kidney function. One study found that mild dehydration caused acute kidney injury in healthy patients.

So, for a healthy patient with mild kidney disease, I generally recommend the opposite of what they might expect to hear. I tell them to drink plenty of water and to avoid things like caffeine, alcohol, and too much salt.

  However, It all depends on the cause of the primary infertility.
If the cause is due to problems in the female genital tract, the chances of second infertility are high.
In contrast, if the cause is due to problems in male genital tract, the chances of second infertility are low.
  Also, the age of the female at the time of trying for the second child may also affect the chances of second infertility.

"Erb's palsy is a neonatal brachial plexus injury that occurs when the upper roots of the brachial plexus become stretched and damaged during delivery. The optimal time for nerve conduction studies is after 2 years of age. If the child is not a candidate for surgery, then there are non-surgical options that include serial manipulation and physical therapy. 

You can find a pediatric neurologist in your area by going to the website for the Child Neurology Society (https://www.childneurologysociety.org/home/find-a-pediatric-neurologist) or American Academy of Neurology (https://www.aan.com/GMEC/search/index.cfm).","There are no established guidelines for the performance of nerve conduction studies in children with Erb's palsy. In general, I would recommend waiting until the child is at least 1 year of age before performing such studies. The reason for waiting is that there is ongoing peripheral and central nervous system maturation occurring until at least 1 year of age, and performing nerve conduction studies may give false negative results due to immature nerves.

Surgical treatment is generally recommended for children with Erb's palsy if there is a significant difference in muscle bulk on the affected side versus the unaffected side. This is usually done between 3-6 months of age.

Alternative methods to electrical pulses for nerve testing include sensory and motor evoked potentials, which can be used in addition to nerve conduction studies. These can be accessed throughout the United States, but you will want to check with your insurance carrier to determine if you will be covered for the testing.","The ideal age for a baby with Erb's Palsy to have a nerve conduction test is within the first 2 months of birth. This is because the earlier the nerve damage is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis for the baby. Surgical intervention is typically recommended if the nerve conduction test shows that there is permanent nerve damage.

There are alternative nerve testing methods beyond electrical pulses, such as sonography and electromyography, which can be used to evaluate the health and function of the affected nerve.

If you are looking for a doctor who can perform these types of tests and diagnose/treat Erb's Palsy, I would recommend that you search for a brachial plexus specialist in the United States. You can find a list of potential specialists by searching online or by asking your pediatrician for a recommendation. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you suspect that your child may be experiencing Erb's Palsy.","Answer:I am not sure if I understand you correctly. You are asking about a baby with Erb's palsy (c5-c6 radial nerve injury) and want to know at what age a nerve conduction test is performed and when surgery is considered?
The condition is usually diagnosed shortly after birth. Surgery is considered if there is a significant motor deficit. The surgery is usually performed between 3 and 6 months after the insult. Now, the reason for the delay is that the little guy needs to be out of the incubator first. The surgery is with the baby face down on the operating table with the arm exposed. The surgeon will make an incision over the injured site and will try to find and identify all the small tendons that are stretched and try to get them back to where they belong. During the surgery, the nerve will be tested repeatedly to look for motor potentials. 
Alternative methods to electrical pulses for nerve conduction tests? I am not sure what you are asking here. The test is usually performed by a pediatric or orthopedic neurologist. I am not sure if your question has to do with the testing itself. If the testing itself, the nerve is usually tested by stimulating the nerve with a weak direct current and recording the motor response in the muscle. This is done by placing two small recording electrodes on the muscle and a stimulating electrode over the nerve. The signal is recorded with the patient contracting and relaxing the muscle. 
Where in the U.S. can one access these services? Most major children's hospitals have a developmental pediatric center that can help you.","A nerve conduction test is a valuable tool that can help diagnose Erb's Palsy. However, surgical intervention is usually recommended after 3-4 months of conservative treatment. There are many alternative methods to electrical pulses for nerve testing, such as sonography. The Sonography Associates of North America (SANA) may be able to help you. They have 18 locations in the U.S. Hope this helps!","There are two types of erb palsy. The first type is the most common and is simply called Erb palsy. It is a form of brachial plexus injury. It occurs when the C5-C6 nerve roots that supply the upper trunk, and specifically the C5 and C6 nerves, are injured. These nerves are the ones that originate in the neck and travel down into the arm to the trunk of the arm. These nerves are responsible for the movement of the arm, and specifically the biceps, wrist, and fingers. They also allow us the ability to feel the sense of touch, pain, temperature, etc. in the arm.
The second type of erb palsy is called Klumpke Palsy. It is a form of brachial plexus injury. It occurs when the C8 and T1 nerve roots that supply the lower trunk, and specifically the C8, T1, and T2 nerves, are injured. These nerves are the ones that originate in the neck and travel down into the arm to the trunk of the arm. These nerves are responsible for the movement of the hand, specifically the thumb, and the fingers (excluding the little finger which is handled by a different nerve). These nerves also allow us the ability to feel the sense of touch, pain, temperature, etc. in the hand.

For type 1 Erb Palsy, the nerve conduction studies should show a ""bi-phasic"" response. A bi-phasic response means that there are two peaks observed as the nerve is tested. One peak is larger than the other. The larger peak occurs because the nerve fibers are trying to stimulate the muscle to contract and the smaller peak occurs because the muscle is trying to relax as it ""twitches"". The bi-phasic response is a characteristic finding of a ""complete"" brachial plexus injury.
For type 2 Erb Palsy, the nerve conduction studies should show a ""distal"" response. A distal response means that there is only one peak observed as the nerve is tested. The small peak occurs because the nerve fibers are trying to stimulate the muscle to contract. The distal response is a characteristic finding of a ""incomplete"" brachial plexus injury"
"It could be, what prescriptions are you referring to?  If you could provide more information I could help further.","I have gone through your question and understand your concern.  You have not mentioned what prescriptions you are taking, so it is hard to say whether they are the cause or not.  However, there are certain medications which are known to cause itching as a side effect, for example, some statins, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, some anti-malarials and some bisphosphonates.  So if you are taking any of these, it may be advisable to speak to your doctor about changing your medication.  If you are not taking any of these medications, then there are other possible causes of itching, such as liver disease, kidney disease, iron deficiency, certain fungal or yeast infections, and some types of cancer.  So while it is possible that your medications are the cause, there are other possible causes which should be investigated if your medications are ruled out. I hope this helps.","It could be.  The most common cause of intense itching sensation on the lower legs at night is intermittent claudication which is a symptom of peripheral artery disease.  It is caused by reduced blood flow to the legs and it tends to occur after sitting or lying down for a period of time.  It is usually most intense at night.  Other possible causes of intense itching sensation on the lower legs at night include: contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and venous insufficiency.  To determine the cause of your intense itching sensation on your lower legs at night you should consult a doctor.  They will be able to rule out venous insufficiency and prescribe medication for any allergies you may have.","1. The most common cause of itching on the lower legs at night is intermittent venous insufficiency, also known as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).  
2. CVI occurs when the veins in the legs cannot pump blood back to the heart effectively. This can lead to swelling, pain, and itching, especially at night. 
3. CVI is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with age. Obesity, pregnancy, and standing for long periods of time can also increase the risk of CVI. 
4. Some medications, such as hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, have been linked to CVI. However, it is important to note that CVI is more commonly caused by other factors such as genetics, age, and obesity.  
5. Treatment for CVI may include compression stockings, wound care, and lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight management. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.","as long as the itching is not related to any infection, the itching is related to the liver. the liver is responsible for removing toxins from the blood and excreting them in the bile. if there is an overload of toxins, the liver will not be able to cope and the blood will become toxic as well, which will manifest in itchiness and bad skin. i recommend doing a liver function test, and if the results show that the liver is overloaded with toxins, i recommend doing a liver cleanse, which will make the liver work properly again and remove the toxins from your body.","It is unlikely but possible.

There are several options available for you to try and improve the condition of your leg.

1. Physiotherapy - This aids in maintaining the current condition of the muscles in the affected leg and also helps to slow down the deterioration of the muscles. It also helps to improve blood circulation and control pain.

2. Acupuncture - This is an alternative therapy which uses needles to stimulate certain points on the body and alleviate pain. It also helps to improve blood circulation.

3. Massage - This helps to alleviate muscle spasms and cramps. It also helps to improve blood circulation and relax the muscles.

4. TENS - This is a portable electronic device which transmits electrical impulses through the skin to prevent pain and stimulate the muscles.

5. Wraps and braces - These help to support the muscles and prevent further deterioration. They also help to alleviate pain.

6. Medication - Your doctor may prescribe painkillers to alleviate pain. In some cases, steroids may be injected into the affected muscles to reduce inflammation and swelling.

You may try all or any of the above options. It may not be possible to restore the use of your leg, but you may find some relief from the symptoms.
You can seek treatment for the above options at any orthopedic clinic. You may need to try different options before you find one that works for you. Do not lose hope.","24 years is a long time to be paralyzed, you should try and see a specialist in orthopedics or neurology to see if there is anything that can be done. Sometimes with paralysis, a small injury can cause more damage to the nerves.

The test is not 100% sensitive, so a person may have syphilis despite a negative VDRL.
2) A positive VDRL is indicative of a previous infection with Treponema pallidum, which means that the person is immune to the disease.
3) However, a person with a false positive VDRL, which occurs in 10% of cases, should be retested after 3 months. If the repeat test is also positive, treatment for syphilis should be initiated.
4) A person with syphilis should be desensitized to Treponema pallidum by administration of intramuscular (IM) penicillin G, followed by oral (PO) penicillin for 12 months.
5) The desensitization schedule depends on the type of syphilis:
- Primary syphilis: 2.4 million units IM, followed by 600 mg PO for 12 months
- Secondary syphilis: 2.4 million units IM, followed by 600 mg PO for 4 weeks
- Latent syphilis (asymptomatic): 600,000 units IM, followed by 600 mg PO for 3 weeks
- Tertiary syphilis (symptomatic): 1.2 million units IM, followed by 600 mg PO for 3 weeks, followed by 600 mg PO for 3 months, then 3 years.
The desensitization schedule may change depending on the clinical state of the patient, so it is important to consult a health professional for appropriate treatment.","1. Confirmation of positive VDRL by EIA. 
2. Clinical evaluation and investigations : - HIV testing, - Vaccination status, - History of multiple sexual partners, - Menstrual history, - Past history of sexually transmitted disease, - Condom use, - Intravenous drug use. 
3. Partner(s) screening and treatment 4. Avoid sexual intercourse during menstruation. 5. Avoid sex with unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse. 6. Use of barrier contraceptive like male condom. 7. Limit number of sexual partners. 8. Both partners should be tested for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and undergo appropriate treatment if positive prior to next contact. 9. Regular follow up with your treating doctor to ensure compliance to above advise and effectiveness of treatment.","As it is just a screening test, VDRL negative patients do not require any precautions. However, VDRL positive patients should be subjected to further evaluation and management. The most important thing is that the patient should be asked whether she is sexually active and a detailed sexual history should be taken. If the patient is sexually active, she should be counselled regarding the possible risks of STDs and the need for treatment of her sexual partner. In addition, she should be asked whether she has engaged in high risk behaviors, such as having unprotected sex or having a number of sexual partners. If the patient is at high risk for STDs, she should be treated with either azithromycin (1 gm single dose) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks). In patients who are pregnant, the treatment should be either azithromycin (single dose of 1gm) or penicillin (4 million units intramuscularly 3 times weekly). In addition, such patients should have routine perinatal follow up, including cesarean section if needed.",A positive VDRL is the diagnosis for a patient who has a VDRL positive result. The precautionary process for patients with a VDRL positive result is to educate the patient about the importance of safe sex practices and to recommend regular follow up visits to screen for any potential STDs.
"The gold standard for diagnosis of MRSA infections is culturing the bacteria from a body fluid or tissue.  Culturing takes time, and it may take several days to get a result.  While waiting for the result, doctors may start treatment based on clinical judgement, that is based on the type of infection suspected and the patient's condition.  If the culture is positive, meaning that MRSA was grown in the culture, then treatment can be continued.  If the culture is negative, meaning no MRSA was grown, then treatment can be stopped.  However, it is possible that MRSA is present but not growing in the culture.  In that case, treatment would be stopped and continued later if symptoms recurred.  There are other tests that can be used to detect MRSA, but culturing is considered the most accurate.","The presence of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) can be detected by culturing it from a body fluid, such as blood or urine. However, absence of growth does not necessarily mean absence of infection. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a sophisticated molecular biology technique which can detect the genetic material of the bacteria in a clinical specimen, even if there is no growth. So, PCR can be used to detect MRSA, even after the completion of antibiotic treatment. This method is particularly useful in patients who were treated with vancomycin, as MRSA infection is common and recurrent in such patients. Vancomycin is an antibiotic to which MRSA is known to develop resistance easily.","1) The standard of care is to use a regimen that is effective against MRSA.
  For example, vancomycin is effective against MRSA.

2) When the infection is resolved, the patient is taken off the antibiotic.

3) There are tests to determine if the MRSA is resistant to vancomycin (or other antibiotics).

  If the MRSA is resistant to vancomycin (or other antibiotics), then a different antibiotic would be used.

  If the MRSA is not resistant to vancomycin (or other antibiotics), then the patient may be treated with vancomycin or the original antibiotic.

  Therefore, when the infection is resolved and the MRSA is not resistant to the original antibiotic, then the patient is likely to be fine.

  In summary, there is no standard approach to determine if the MRSA has been fully eliminated from the system.
  However, when the infection is resolved, the MRSA is not resistant to vancomycin (or the original antibiotic), and the patient is taken off the antibiotic, then the MRSA is likely to be fully eliminated from the system.","30 days or more after finishing antibiotics, a culture for MRSA is negative. However, there are still ways to check if MRSA bacteria still exists in the body after a long course of antibiotics. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can detect the genetic material of the bacteria in a urine or blood sample. A bone marrow biopsy can also detect the bacteria in bone marrow. These tests are more sensitive than cultures and can detect MRSA even when there is not a large number of bacteria present. Regards","The short answer is ""No"".  There is no test that can determine with certainty that MRSA has been completely cleared from your system.  There are many factors that go into determining whether or not an infection is gone and the lab tests that are used to diagnose MRSA infections are designed to indicate a likely or suspected infection, not to determine whether or not antibiotics have worked.
MRSA, or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, is a type of bacteria which is resistant to many common antibiotics, making it difficult to treat.  Tests to determine if MRSA are present include culture (growing the bacteria in a lab and seeing if they are resistant to methicillin), PCR (looking for genetic markers of MRSA), and other types of lab tests which identify the bacteria by sight.
These tests are useful for diagnosing MRSA infections, but not for determining if antibiotics have worked.  If you have been treated for MRSA and show no signs or symptoms of infection, you may be considered cured, but this is determined by your symptoms and physical examination, not by lab tests.  MRSA is known to linger in the nasal passages without causing symptoms, so even if you still have MRSA in your body, you may be considered cured if you are not showing signs of an active infection.  MRSA is also known to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics, so even if you have been treated with effective antibiotics, there may be strains remaining that are resistant to those antibiotics.  In short, there is no definitive test to determine whether MRSA has been completely cleared from your body.","I am unaware of any specific test to detect MRSA infection in the body. However, the standard of care for MRSA infection is to use blood cultures to confirm that the bacteria have been eradicated from the bloodstream. This is true for both hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA infections.

Additionally, healthcare providers may take swabs from the infected area and grow the bacteria in a lab to confirm that they are MRSA. They may also run a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the genetic fingerprint of the bacteria. These tests are more useful for identifying the specific strain of MRSA and detecting antibiotic resistance. However, the standard of care for diagnosing and treating MRSA infection is blood cultures."
