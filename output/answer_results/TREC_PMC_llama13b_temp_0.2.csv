"Migraine is a complex disorder with multiple subtypes.  The treatment of migraine is challenging because the disorder has many different subtypes and the response to treatment differs among subtypes.  In order to better match treatment to subtype, researchers have attempted to classify migraine into distinct subtypes based on clinical features and therapeutic response.  Two of the best examples of this approach are the classification of migraine by its association with either aura or without aura and the classification of headache as chronic migraine, episodic migraine, or chronic tension-type headache.  In terms of treatment, the triptans are effective at treating migraine with aura, while the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective at treating migraine without aura.  Similarly, preventive treatment is effective at treating chronic migraine, while abortive treatment is effective at treating episodic migraine.  In the future, it is likely that new treatments will be developed that are specific for the different subtypes of migraine.","1. Yes, there are studies that have investigated which migraine treatments are most effective for specific migraine conditions. 2. For example, studies have found that triptans are particularly effective for patients with aura, while NSAIDs are particularly effective for patients without aura. 3. In addition, studies have found that opioids are particularly effective for patients with severe migraine, while botulinum toxin is particularly effective for patients with chronic migraine.","Yes.  Researchers have studied how well different treatments work for patients with different types of migraine.  For example, medications that contain ergotamine or sumatriptan are most effective for patients with migraine with aura.  Medications that contain propranolol are most effective for patients with migraine without aura.","1. Summary Migraine is a common, debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent headaches. Although migraine has been recognized for millennia, its pathophysiology is not fully understood. 2. Background Migraine is a common, debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent headaches. Although migraine has been recognized for millennia, its pathophysiology is not fully understood. 3. Objective To review the current understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine and the clinical implications of this knowledge. 4. Sources A MEDLINE search was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists of retrieved articles and recent review articles were hand-searched for additional material. Search terms included ""migraine, "" ""pathogenesis, "" ""pathophysiology, "" ""trigeminal, "" ""neurogenic, "" ""vascular, "" ""extracerebral, "" ""intracranial, "" ""genetic, "" ""epidemiology, "" ""clinical features, "" ""diagnosis, "" ""treatment, "" ""triptans, "" ""occipital nerve stimulation, "" ""surgery, "" and ""botulinum toxin."" 5. Methods We focused on articles published since 1990 and English-language material. We excluded case reports, animal studies, and studies with fewer than 10 patients. 6. Results The trigeminal system has a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Peripheral triggers (e.g., distension of the extracerebral carotid artery) activate cephalic nociceptive afferent fibers that converge in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and project to the thalamus and brain stem. In the brainstem, the trigeminovascular system interacts with the hypothalamus, which controls heat loss, and with the nucleus tractus solitarius, which regulates blood pressure. Activation of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and nucleus tractus solitarius causes release of vasoactive neuropeptides, including substance P, neurokinin A, and neuropeptide Y, which dilate the extrac","1. Yes, several studies have attempted to categorize migraine treatments by their effectiveness against specific migraine subtypes. 2. These studies have found that triptans are the most effective treatments for migraine with aura, while NSAIDs are the most effective treatments for migraine without aura. 3. Other treatments, such as opioids, are effective for both types of migraine. 4. Some studies have also attempted to determine whether migraine subtypes respond differently to different treatments. These studies have found that migraine with aura responds best to triptans, while migraine without aura responds best to NSAIDs.","1) Yes, there is scientific evidence that links specific migraine treatments to their effectiveness against distinct migraine conditions. 2) The scientific evidence shows that: a) Triptans are the most effective treatments for acute migraine attacks; b) Some triptans are also effective in preventing migraine attacks; c) Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are also effective in acute migraine attacks; d) Some antidepressants are effective in preventing migraine attacks; e) Some anticonvulsants are effective in preventing migraine attacks; f) Some analgesics are effective in providing relief from migraine pain; g) Some herbal treatments are effective in providing relief from migraine pain; h) Some treatments have no proven effectiveness in providing relief from migraine pain."

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. 2. Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism--the way the body uses energy. It also helps control the way children grow and develop. 3. Hypothyroidism can be caused by problems with the thyroid gland or by problems with the pituitary gland, which makes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH tells the thyroid gland how much thyroid hormone to make. 4. Hypothyroidism can be passed down through families (inherited). It can also be caused by certain medicines and radiation treatments for cancer. 5. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, and depression. 6. A child with hypothyroidism may be slower to develop and may not grow as fast as other children. 7. The doctor uses a blood test to check thyroid hormone levels in the body. Treatment involves taking a pill every day that has the right amount of thyroid hormone. 8. Most people need to take the medicine for life.","1. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. 2. Thyroid hormone affects almost every organ in the body. It sets the stage for a child's growth and development. It influences how fast a child's heart beats, how well his muscles, joints, and organs work, and how much energy a child has. 3. Hypothyroidism in children is most often caused by chronic inflammation (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or injury to or absence of the thyroid gland (congenital hypothyroidism). 4. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a common condition in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children and in people who are over 60 years old. 5. Congenital hypothyroidism is present from birth. It occurs when the thyroid gland does not develop correctly or when it is absent. 6. Hypothyroidism can also be caused by certain medications, radiation treatment, and complete or partial absence of the thyroid gland. 7. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed with blood tests that measure thyroid hormone levels. Treatment involves taking a daily pill that contains the missing thyroid hormone.","1.

Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism—the way the body uses energy—and affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the body's functions slow down.  Hypothyroidism is often called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism can be caused by:   - Hashimoto's disease (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis)—an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to become inflamed and interferes with its ability to make thyroid hormone  - thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)—causes the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone at first, then not enough. This is often caused by a viral infection  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland  - radiation treatment of the thyroid gland  - some medicines, such as amiodarone, lithium, and p-aminosalicylic acid  - severe diet deficiencies of iodine and selenium. These are the minerals the thyroid gland needs to make thyroid hormone  - congenital (birth) defects in the thyroid gland  - rare conditions such as a thyroid hormone resistance, in which the body does not respond to the thyroid hormone it makes  - pituitary gland tumor, which may interfere with the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) that controls the release of thyroid hormone  - other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, and pernicious anemia  - HIV infection  - severe weight loss.  Symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the cause and can include the following:   - fatigue  - constipation  - depression  - weight gain  - cold intolerance  - dry, coarse skin and hair  - muscle cramps and stiffness  - menstrual irregularities  - infertility  - hoarse voice  - slow reflexes  - sensitivity to cold  - carpal","1.

"1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and BCKDHS genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These three genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together as a complex. This complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many kinds of food, especially protein-rich foods such as milk and meat. 2. Mutations in any of these three genes reduce or eliminate the function of the protein complex, preventing the breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. 3. Over time, high levels of these substances in the blood and urine can lead to a variety of serious health problems, including mental retardation, breathing problems, and heart and kidney failure. 4. Maple syrup urine disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 5. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. 6. Most often, parents who have one child with autosomal recessive disorder like MSUD, are not affected themselves. 7. They are considered carriers of the disorder. 8. Carriers have one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. If both parents are carriers, their child has a 25% chance of developing the disorder. 9. There is no cure for maple syrup urine disease. Treatment involves avoiding foods high in protein, such as milk and meat, and preventing the buildup of dietary byproducts that are produced when proteins are not broken down completely in the body. 10. Doing this can help reduce or prevent the symptoms associated with this disorder.","1. Mutations in the BCKDH gene cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD).

"1. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a defect in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. The diaphragm allows the lungs to work properly. A baby with CDH may not be able to breathe properly because the organs in the abdomen are pushing into the chest cavity and pressing on the lungs.2. Yes, CDH can be passed down to future generations.3. Yes, the term ""congenital"" means that it could be passed down to another generation.4. The cause of CDH is not known. Most cases occur as a sporadic event, that is, one that occurs without any family history or known cause. About 20% of the time, there is a family history of the condition.5. There is no known way to prevent CDH.6. CDH occurs in about one out of every 2,000 births.7. No, CDH is not contagious.8. No, CDH cannot be diagnosed before birth.9. The diagnosis is made after a baby is born.10. The first sign of CDH may be when a baby has trouble breathing at birth.11. The most common cause of death in a baby with CDH is a lack of breathing (respiratory failure).12. The most common abnormalities seen in babies with CDH are heart defects, chromosome abnormalities, and abnormalities in the intestines and major blood vessels.13. CDH is most often diagnosed at birth.14. The first step in treating CDH is to reposition the organs that have moved into the chest cavity. This is done by putting a tube (a nasogastric tube) through the baby's mouth into the stomach. The air is then slowly withdrawn from the stomach, causing the abdominal organs to move back into the abdomen.15. The next step is to provide supportive care until the baby's lungs and breathing improve. This may take several days to weeks.16. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has greatly improved the survival of babies with CDH.17","1. Yes, CDH can be inherited by future generations. 2. The term 'congenital' does not imply a risk of passing it down.","1. Yes, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can be passed on to subsequent generations. 2. It is a genetic disorder caused by abnormal closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal, which results in the abdominal organs being displaced into the thoracic cavity. 3. The defect allows the abdominal contents to enter the chest cavity, thereby compromising lung development and resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. 4. The most common cause of CDH is a genetic defect, which is thought to be caused by the absence of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF-9). 5. The genetic defect is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the defective gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. 6. In most cases, the condition is not inherited, but occurs as a result of a new mutation in the affected child. 7. In rare instances, the condition may be inherited from a parent who also has the condition.","1. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition that can be inherited. 2. The term 'congenital' indicates that the condition can be inherited from a person's parents. 3.

"3-SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that causes a wide range of symptoms affecting the autonomic nervous system, including postural hypotension, urinary incontinence, and gastrointestinal problems. 3-SCA3 is caused by a mutation in the MJD/SCA3 gene on chromosome 14. The MJD/SCA3 gene encodes a protein called ataxin-3. Researchers are not sure how a mutation in this gene causes the disease. 3-SCA3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. 3-SCA3 affects males and females equally. The symptoms of 3-SCA3 usually begin between ages 20 and 30, but they can begin anytime from childhood to late adulthood. The severity and rate of progression of the disease vary from person to person. People with 3-SCA3 usually live 15 to 20 years after symptoms begin.","Yes, MedlinePlus can help you find information about Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

What treatments are available for spinocerebellar ataxia? Where can I find more information about spinocerebellar ataxia?","1. What is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is one of a group of inherited disorders called spinocerebellar ataxias. People with SCA3 have progressive problems with movement. This includes uncoordinated, uncontrolled, or shaky movements (called ataxia). People with SCA3 may also have other symptoms, including muscle stiffness or tightness, muscle twitching, and cramping. Symptoms usually begin in adulthood, but can start at any age. There is no cure for SCA3. Medicines and physical therapy may help some symptoms. 2. What causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  SCA3 is caused by a gene mutation. The gene is called ATXN3. The gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-3. Researchers are not sure how ataxin-3 works, but they think it might be involved in processing and regulating RNA. RNA is a molecule that carries instructions from DNA to make proteins. Ataxin-3 might help regulate the processing of RNA into protein. Researchers think that problems with ataxin-3 cause SCA3. 3. How is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 inherited?  SCA3 is an autosomal dominant disorder. Autosomal means that the gene is not on a sex (X or Y) chromosome, but is on one of the other 22 pairs of chromosomes. Dominant means that one copy of the gene mutation is enough to cause the disorder. In most cases, people with SCA3 inherit the gene mutation from one affected parent. 4. What are the symptoms of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  Symptoms of SCA3 usually begin in adulthood, but they can start at any age.

Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands, wrists, feet, ankles, knees, elbows, and shoulders. The clinical course of RA is highly variable, and the presentation of the disease can range from asymptomatic to fulminant. The majority of patients experience periods of remission and relapse throughout the course of their disease. The clinical features of RA include the following: morning stiffness in and around the joints that lasts for more than 1 hour and is relieved by exercise, joint swelling, and tenderness, and the development of bony deformities of the hand and foot. The diagnosis of RA is based on the combination of several clinical features, including the presence of joint swelling, morning stiffness, and tenderness; the exclusion of other inflammatory or degenerative arthropathies; and the demonstration of characteristic serologic abnormalities, such as elevated titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies.","2010 words

The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known. Researchers believe that rheumatoid arthritis is the result of an interaction between genetic and environmental factors.

A genetic predisposition to RA is supported by the finding that the disease clusters in families. The risk of developing RA is 3 to 4 times greater if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) has the disease. The risk is even higher if more than one first-degree relative has RA.

Scientists have identified genes that are associated with RA, but no single gene causes the disease. It is likely that many genes interact to produce RA. Identifying these genes will help researchers understand the underlying biology of RA and why individuals with the same genetic makeup have different courses of the disease.

Environmental factors also play a role in RA. Several studies have shown that individuals who are exposed to silicone (a substance found in some industrial processes and in some consumer products, such as cooking and baking utensils) are more likely to develop RA than those who are not exposed to silicone. Cigarette smoking is linked to the development of RA; the risk of developing RA is 1.5 times greater for smokers than for nonsmokers.

Other environmental factors that may increase the risk of developing RA include:

Infections. Some studies suggest that a history of infection with the bacteria that causes strep throat (group A streptococcus) may increase the risk of developing RA.
Diet. Some studies suggest that eating foods that contain a large amount of vitamin C may reduce the risk of developing RA.
Obesity. Some studies suggest that obesity increases the risk of developing RA, while other studies show no relationship between obesity and RA.

The symptoms of RA typically develop gradually over a period of weeks to months. These symptoms include:

Morning stiffness. Joint stiffness after periods of inactivity is the most common sign of RA. Stiffness lasts for more than 1 hour and often disappears with exercise.
Pain. Joint pain and tenderness are common with RA.
Swelling. Swelling of the affected joints is common.",30 to 40 years of age

"1. Gender dysphoria is a medical condition in which someone's assigned gender at birth is different from the way they truly identify. It's normal to experience distress from this discrepancy. 2. Treatment for gender dysphoria typically involves psychotherapy and/or hormone therapy. 3. Psychotherapy can help individuals explore and understand their gender identity and come to terms with their assigned gender. 4. Hormone therapy involves taking hormones that align with one's identified gender. 5. Hormone therapy can involve the use of estrogen and/or testosterone. 6. It's important to note that hormone therapy can lead to physical changes, such as breast development or the reduction of body hair, which may or may not be desired by the individual. 7. It's important to note that not all individuals with gender dysphoria will choose to undergo hormone therapy, and not all individuals who do will choose to undergo surgical interventions. 8. Some individuals may also choose to explore gender affirming surgeries, such as facial feminization or masculinization, breast augmentation, or genital reconstruction. 9.

People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.  Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by changes (mutations) in one of several genes, which can be inherited from a person's parents. It is passed along in families (inherited) in an autosomal recessive pattern.  The main symptom of Leber congenital amaurosis is severe vision impairment that begins in infancy or early childhood. Other symptoms can include:  - an inability to see clearly in dim light (night blindness)  - an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)  - involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus)  - an unusually small head (microcephaly)  - an unusually large head (macrocephaly)  - intellectual disability  - seizures  - abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects)  - an inability to coordinate movement (ataxia)  - an inability to properly judge distance (dysmetropsia)  - an increased number of teeth (hyperdontia)  - an increased sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia)  - an increased number of joints that bend in multiple directions (multiple joints with redundant movement)  - unusually flexible joints (hypermobility)  - myopia (nearsightedness)  - an abnormal shape or structure of the eye (microphthalmia)  - an unusually small eye (microphthalmos)  - an abnormally large eye (megalophthalmos)  - an unusually slanted or round-shaped eye (peculiar ocular shape)  - a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned (strabismus)  - uncontrolled or involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)  - unusually small eyebrows (synophrys)  - an inability to","1. Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 2. Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by changes (mutations) in one of several genes, which are called LCA genes. 3. The LCA genes carry the instructions for making proteins that are needed in cells within the retina. 4. Researchers have identified more than 10 different LCA genes. 5. The number of genes involved and the specific mutations within those genes determine the severity and the age at which the symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis begin. 6. In most cases, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that two copies of the gene in each parent must be altered for their child to have the condition. 7. In some cases, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that only one copy of the gene in each parent must be altered for their child to have the condition. 8. In very rare instances, the disorder results from a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is a small, circular piece of DNA that is located outside the cell nucleus. It is inherited from the mother. 9. People with Leber congenital amaurosis are usually born with poor vision. The vision slowly gets worse during childhood and adolescence. By the time they reach adulthood, most people with this disorder are blind. 10. In addition to vision problems, people with Leber congenital amaurosis may have other features, including: 11. Narrowing of the angle between the iris and the cornea (the clear front covering of the eye). This can cause problems with depth perception. 12.

"1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. 2. Feeding tubes are used to provide nutrition to patients who are unable to eat normally. 3. TPN is a type of intravenous feeding that provides nutrients such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates directly into the bloodstream. 4. People with gastroparesis often need to eat many small meals throughout the day. 5. A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is a feeding tube that goes directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. 6. TPN is used for patients who are not able to get adequate nutrition by eating or through a feeding tube.","Gastroparesis is a disorder that affects the normal motility of the stomach. It is often associated with other conditions such as diabetes, scleroderma, and Parkinson's disease. The cause of gastroparesis is not completely understood, but it is thought to be related to damage to the vagus nerve and changes in the electrical activity of the stomach. The symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and difficulty in swallowing. Patients with gastroparesis are often misdiagnosed because their symptoms are similar to those of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The diagnosis of gastroparesis is made by a test called the gastric emptying scan. This test shows how fast the stomach is emptying. A low-fat meal that contains a radioactive tracer is given to the patient, and a gamma camera is used to follow the movement of the meal through the stomach. The most common treatment for gastroparesis is dietary modification. Patients should eat small, frequent meals that are low in fat and fiber. In some cases, medications may be given to help with emptying. If medical therapy fails, surgical options such as gastric stimulation and gastrostomy may be considered.","Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents. It can be caused by a variety of disorders or injuries, including:  - Autonomic neuropathy  - Diabetes  - Infection  - Intestinal obstruction  - Neurologic disorders  - Spinal cord injury  - Stroke  - Surgery  - Tube feeding  - Tumors  - Vagus nerve damage  - Viral infections  - Gastroparesis may also be caused by the use of certain medications, such as narcotics, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants.  The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms include:  - Abdominal bloating  - Abdominal distention  - Abdominal pain  - Early satiety (feeling full after eating a small amount of food)  - Weight loss Treatment depends on the cause and may include dietary management, medication, and, in some cases, surgery. If dietary management and medication do not improve the symptoms, surgery may be an option. Surgical options include:  - Gastric pacemaker implantation  - Gastric stimulator implantation  - Jejunostomy tube placement  - Pyloroplasty  - Vagotomy  - Vagotomy and pyloroplasty  - Gastrostomy tube placement  - Feeding jejunostomy tube placement","1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. It is often associated with other serious disorders, such as diabetes or scleroderma. 2. A feeding tube is a tube that is inserted through the nose or mouth into the stomach or small intestine. It can be used to give food directly to the stomach or small intestine, bypassing the mouth and esophagus. 3. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of feeding that bypasses the stomach and small intestine and goes directly into a vein. It is given through a small tube inserted into a vein in the chest, arm, or groin.","Gastroparesis is a disorder that affects the normal movement of the muscles in your stomach. It slows or prevents the stomach from emptying. This prevents nutrients from being properly digested and absorbed by the body.  Causes  Gastroparesis can be caused by:  - Autonomic neuropathy  - Diabetes  - Infection  - Injury to the stomach or vagus nerve  - Medications, such as opioids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics  - Metabolic disorders, such as hypothyroidism and kidney failure  - Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis  - Scleroderma  - Spinal cord injury  - Stomach cancer  - Surgery that involves the stomach or vagus nerve  Signs and symptoms  Because food doesn't move through the system properly, you may experience:  - Abdominal pain  - Bloating  - Dehydration  - Difficulty eating  - Feeling full after eating just a few bites  - Nausea and vomiting  - Weight loss  Diagnosis  Your doctor may diagnose gastroparesis based on your medical history, a physical examination, and test results. Two tests that may be used are:  - Barium swallow x-ray  - Gastric emptying scan (Gastrografin swallow)  Treatment  Treatment for gastroparesis may include:  - Changing your diet to soft, easy-to-digest foods  - Eating smaller, more-frequent meals  - Taking medications to control nausea and vomiting  - Getting nutrients through a feeding tube inserted through the nose or mouth (gastrostomy tube) or through a surgically created opening in the stomach (jejunostomy tube)  - Getting fluids and nutrients through an IV  - Taking medications that help stimulate the movement of food through the digestive system  - Surgery to remove part of the stomach or bypass it","Gastroparesis is a condition where the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine. It can be caused by damage to the vagus nerve or the intercostal nerves that go to the stomach. It can also be caused by some medications, such as narcotics, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. It can also be caused by severe anxiety or depression.  Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety (feeling full after eating a small amount of food), bloating, and diarrhea.  Diagnosis is made by a test called gastric emptying scan. Treatment includes dietary modification, such as eating many small meals during the day. It also includes avoiding carbonation in beverages, since it can increase nausea and vomiting. Medications that can be used to treat gastroparesis include metoclopramide, erythromycin, and octreotide. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be needed to ensure that the person is getting adequate nutrition.  Feeding tubes can be either nasogastric (a tube that goes through the nose and down into the stomach) or gastrostomy (a tube that goes through the skin and directly into the stomach). The type of tube used depends on the reason the person needs the tube.  Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a type of intravenous feeding. It involves a large vein, such as the subclavian or jugular vein. A catheter is put into the vein, and the nutrients are put into the vein through the catheter. TPN is used when someone is not able to get nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract. It can be used for people with gastroparesis who are not able to get adequate nutrition by any other means."
"1. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that requires careful management to prevent or reduce the risk of complications. 2. Complications of type 1 diabetes are related to the effects of high blood glucose levels and the autoimmune process that leads to the destruction of the insulin-producing cells. 3. Complications may include: - Eye problems, including glaucoma, cataracts, and blindness. - Kidney damage (nephropathy), including kidney failure. - Nerve damage (neuropathy), which can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, and burning sensations in the hands and feet. - Skin problems, including itchy skin, infections, and ulcers. - Gum problems and other dental problems. - Heart attack, stroke, and circulation problems. - Pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, fetal congenital anomalies, and delivery complications. - Chronic complications of type 1 diabetes can be reduced with good management of your blood glucose levels.","1. Diabetes can lead to a variety of complications if it is not well controlled. These include: 2. Eye problems, including glaucoma, cataracts, and blindness. 3. Kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. 4. Nerve damage, which can lead to pain, tingling, and numbness in the hands and feet. 5. Damage to the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other problems. 6. Poor blood circulation to the feet and legs, which can lead to pain and sores on the feet and legs. 7. Diabetic neuropathy. 8. Diabetic retinopathy. 9. Diabetic kidney disease.","100% of type 1 diabetics will develop complications if they live long enough. This is because of the damage that the high blood sugars do to the small blood vessels in the body. This damage is cumulative, so the longer the patient has diabetes, the more damage there is. However, good control of the blood sugars can slow the process.","1) The most common complication of type 1 diabetes is hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This can occur if the person takes too much insulin, or if they eat less food than they have taken insulin for, or if they exercise more than expected. 2) Another common complication is high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). This can occur if the person is ill, or if they eat more food than they have taken insulin for, or if they take less insulin than they need. 3) Long-term complications of diabetes include: - eye problems - kidney problems - nerve problems - circulation problems - foot problems","1. Diabetes complications may include:  Nerve damage (neuropathy). This is the most common cause of foot problems. Nerve damage can lead to loss of feeling in your feet, which can make it harder to notice cuts and bruises. If you have any foot problems, contact your doctor right away.  High blood glucose and high blood pressure can damage the tiny blood vessels in your eyes, which may lead to vision problems.  Damage to the kidneys. The kidneys can be damaged by high blood pressure and also by having too much protein in your urine. Kidney damage can lead to kidney failure.  Damage to the heart and blood vessels. Having high blood glucose and high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in your heart and the heart itself. This can lead to heart attack or stroke.  Damage to the nervous system. Nerve damage from diabetes can lead to pain, tingling, and numbness in your arms and legs. It can also make it harder for you to notice when you have an infection. 2. The risk of complications is affected by how long you have diabetes. Some complications, such as eye problems, nerve damage, and heart disease, are more common in people who have had diabetes for a long time. 3. Keeping your blood glucose and blood pressure levels near your targets can help you avoid some of these complications. Good control of your diabetes may help prevent complications. If you have complications, good control may help prevent them from getting worse.","1) Eye problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the retina. This is called diabetic retinopathy. It can lead to vision loss. To prevent this, your friend should have his eyes checked once a year by an ophthalmologist. 2) Kidney problems: Diabetes can also damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This is called diabetic nephropathy. It can lead to kidney failure. To prevent this, your friend should have his kidneys checked by a doctor every year. He should also make sure that his blood pressure and blood sugar levels are under control. 3) Nerve problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels that supply nerves. This is called diabetic neuropathy. It can lead to pain, tingling, and numbness in the hands and feet. To prevent this, your friend should keep his blood sugar levels under control. He should also try to manage any nerve pain he may have. 4) Foot problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels and nerves in the feet. This can lead to problems like ulcers and infections. To prevent this, your friend should check his feet every day. He should also wear shoes and socks that fit well. He should not walk barefoot."
"1. The treatment of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is symptomatic. 2. The treatment modalities include topical anesthetics, topical steroids, tricyclic antidepressants, clonazepam, nortriptyline, and alphalipoic acid. 3. The treatment is often frustrating because the condition is chronic and the response to treatment is variable. 4. The treatment is directed towards the relief of symptoms.","The results of our study suggest that a defect in salivary gland function may be responsible for the burning mouth syndrome.  We found that the salivary glands of patients with the disorder were not able to release as much saliva as the glands of people without the condition.  This finding suggests that the syndrome may be caused by a problem with the nerves that control salivary gland function.  We also found that a drug that improves nerve function, called gabapentin, relieved the symptoms in our patients.  Gabapentin is already widely used for other conditions, and has few side effects.  Therefore, it may be useful for treating the burning mouth syndrome.  We are now conducting a larger study to confirm our findings and determine the optimal dose of gabapentin for treating the disorder.","1) The researchers have developed a mouthwash containing an antioxidant and a substance that blocks the action of inflammatory chemicals. 2) The mouthwash is being tested in a clinical trial, which will determine whether it is safe and effective for treating burning mouth syndrome. 3) It will be at least several years before the mouthwash is approved and available to the public. 4) In the meantime, the researchers suggest that people with burning mouth syndrome try the following: - avoiding irritants such as smoking, alcohol, and spicy foods - using saliva substitutes to moisten the mouth - practicing stress-reducing techniques, such as yoga or meditation - trying over-the-counter remedies, such as oral analgesics and antacids","The timeline for making this treatment available to patients is dependent upon the approval of the compound by the FDA.  The FDA has already approved the compound for use in other conditions, so the timeline should be relatively short.  However, the compound is still under patent protection, so the cost of the compound is a factor.  Once the patent protection expires, the cost of the compound will decrease, and it will be more readily available to patients.","1. The burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic pain condition of unknown etiology that affects the oral mucosa. 2. The underlying mechanism of the BMS is still unknown. 3. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a new drug, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 4. Sixty patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either SAMe 200 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks. 5. The results of this study showed that treatment with SAMe is effective in the treatment of BMS.","1. The treatment proposed in this study is still in the preclinical research phase, meaning that it has not yet been tested in humans. 2. Once the treatment has been tested in humans and found to be safe and effective, it will need to go through the FDA approval process. This can take several years. 3. Once approved, the treatment will be available to the public through prescription."

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb bicarbonate (HCO3), which is a type of acid. As a result, bicarbonate is lost in the urine and the body does not have enough bicarbonate. 3. The loss of bicarbonate causes the body to become more acidic. The body tries to compensate for the excess acid by removing excess acid from the blood. This is done by increasing the breathing rate and by excreting acid in the urine. 4. Distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by inherited genetic mutations, autoimmune disorders, or it can be acquired. 5. The symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis can vary from person to person. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may have symptoms such as: fatigue, weakness, and dehydration. 6. Treatment for distal renal tubular acidosis involves taking medications to replace bicarbonate and to increase the amount of bicarbonate in the blood. People with distal renal tubular acidosis should also eat a diet that is low in acid.","1) Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2) The kidneys normally work to keep the body at a healthy pH by removing excess acid in the blood and returning it to the blood at a higher pH. 3) In dRTA, the kidneys cannot do this properly. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 4) There are two main types of dRTA. Type 1 occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove hydrogen ions from the blood into the urine. This is the most common type of dRTA. 5) Type 2 occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove ammonium ions from the blood into the urine. 6) Causes of Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis: 1) Hereditary (inherited) disorders 2) Low levels of potassium or calcium in the blood 3) Long-term use of certain medications, such as amphotericin B, ifosfamide, and acetazolamide 4) Long-term use of drugs such as aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and phenylbutazone 5) Prolonged use of certain antibiotics 6) Prolonged use of the diuretic (water pill) furosemide (Lasix) 7) High levels of uric acid in the urine 8) High levels of urea in the urine 9) Kidney damage caused by autoimmune disorders, such as Sjogren's syndrome and lupus 10) Kidney damage caused by conditions such as diabetes, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis 11) Kidney transplant rejection 12) Prolonged use of a tubular nephropathy","1.

Inherited distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by defects in the gene for the protein ATP6N, which is necessary for the function of the hydrogen-transporting ion pumps in the kidney. 5. Acquired distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by autoimmune disorders, such as Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be caused by the use of certain medications, such as amphotericin B, ifosfamide, and acetazolamide, and by the presence of kidney stones. 6. Distal renal tubular acidosis is often associated with other disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteomalacia. 7. The symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include muscle weakness, fatigue, and slowed growth in children. People with this disorder may also have weak bones and muscles, and they may experience bone pain. 8. The diagnosis is based on the results of a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Treatment may include dietary changes, medications, and dialysis.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The most common type of distal renal tubular acidosis is called type 1. It is most often diagnosed in children. 3. Type 2 distal renal tubular acidosis occurs more often in adults. It is usually diagnosed in people over age 40. 4. Type 4 distal renal tubular acidosis is rare.

"1. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that prevents the body from expelling excess copper. This accumulation can lead to damage in several organs, including the brain, liver, and eyes.  2. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the tissues. This is done by giving medications that bind to the excess copper and help the body eliminate it. Medications include: - Trientine (Syprine) - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Winton) - Zinc acetate (Galzin) 3. Liver transplantation may be considered for people with severe liver damage. This can cure the disease. 4. The prognosis is best for those who begin treatment early. Those with neurologic symptoms have the worst prognosis. Those with only liver disease have a better prognosis. 5. The disease is progressive. With treatment, the disease may be controlled. Without treatment, the disease will continue to get worse and can be fatal. 6. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts research on many digestive and kidney diseases and makes the results available to the public. 7.

Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A. Without this enzyme, a fatty substance, or lipid, called GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. This accumulation causes progressive damage to the cells. 2. Clubfoot is a condition in which the foot turns inward and downward. The cause is not known, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 3. The most common cause of Tay-Sachs disease is when both parents carry a copy of the defective gene. When both parents carry a copy of the defective gene, there is a 25% chance of the child having the disease. 4. Clubfoot is a congenital disorder that occurs in a child's foot causing one or both feet to turn inward and downward. 5. The cost of the tests for Tay-Sachs disease varies, but most health insurance plans cover the cost. Testing a child for Tay-Sachs disease is a two-step process. The first test, usually performed when the baby is between 1 and 2 days old, is a blood test. This test looks for high levels of the chemical GM2 ganglioside in the blood. A second test, which looks for the actual gene mutation, is performed if the first test is positive. 6. Treatment for clubfoot involves manipulating and splinting the foot into the correct position. This is done regularly for several months.

"1. Diabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.2. Type 1 diabetes, which is usually a result of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, is a disease with onset in childhood or early adulthood. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin.3. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after delivery but may increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.4. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. With prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.5. Diabetes cannot be cured. But you can take steps to manage it and prevent complications. Good control of your blood glucose can reduce your risk of complications.6. Diabetes can affect many parts of your body. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. It can also cause problems with your gums and teeth.7. High blood glucose can also cause skin problems and make it harder to heal. It can cause blurry vision and make you feel tired.8. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.9. Diabetes also increases your risk of getting heart disease, stroke and other problems. Good control of your blood glucose can reduce your risk of complications.","1. The pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, which is responsible for regulating the amount of glucose in the blood. In diabetes, the pancreas produces less insulin or the body does not respond to it as well as it should. This causes glucose to build up in the blood. 2. The urinary bladder is heavier because it holds urine, which is made in the kidneys. Urine is made from the waste products that the body does not need.","1. The brain is the control center for glucose regulation. The stomach produces ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite and causes the pancreas to produce insulin. The pancreas produces insulin in response to high glucose levels in the blood. The kidneys produce a hormone called renin that causes the release of angiotensin II, which stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain salt and water, which increases blood volume and increases blood pressure. The urinary bladder is a reservoir for urine. When it is constantly full, it gains weight. 2. The urinary bladder is a reservoir for urine. When it is constantly full, it gains weight.","1. The pancreas is the organ that contributes to the increase in blood sugar levels in diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, a hormone that helps glucose enter cells of the body. In people with diabetes, the pancreas either produces less insulin or doesn't produce any. As a result, glucose stays in the blood instead of entering cells of the body. 2. The urine bladder becomes disproportionately heavier because the body is trying to get rid of the excess glucose in the blood. The kidneys filter glucose from the blood into the urine. But in people with diabetes, the kidneys are working overtime, and glucose stays in the urine instead of being reabsorbed by the kidneys. This causes the urine bladder to become disproportionately heavier.","1. The brain, stomach, and urine bladder are three of the body's largest consumers of glucose. When they take up too much glucose, the body's cells are starved of glucose. This causes the pancreas to secrete more insulin, which leads to higher than normal insulin levels in the blood. 2. The urine bladder is a muscular organ that has the ability to stretch and expand. This allows it to hold urine for long periods of time without contracting. Because it is constantly being stretched, the urine bladder has a higher percentage of muscle tissue than most other parts of the body, and this gives it a higher weight.",1. The brain receives information from the stomach and urine bladder and sends signals to the pancreas to regulate insulin production and secretion. 2. The urine bladder has a greater weight gain because it receives more food than other body parts.
"1. What is trimethylaminuria (TMAU)? Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a condition that affects the body's ability to process trimethylamine, a chemical compound that has a pungent odor. People with TMAU have high levels of trimethylamine in their urine, sweat, and breath. This causes a strong, unpleasant odor that smells like rotting fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. 2. What causes TMAU? TMAU is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene. This gene plays a role in metabolizing (processing) chemicals in the body. The FMO3 gene mutation causes the body to be unable to process trimethylamine. As a result, trimethylamine builds up in the body and is released through the urine, sweat, and breath. 3. Who is affected by TMAU? TMAU is an autosomal recessive condition. This means that both copies of the FMO3 gene must be mutated for a person to be affected. If only one copy of the gene is mutated, the person is considered a carrier for TMAU. 4. How is TMAU diagnosed? A doctor may suspect TMAU based on a person's symptoms and medical history. A urine test can measure the amount of trimethylamine in the urine. In some cases, a blood test can check for the FMO3 gene mutation. 5. What is the treatment for TMAU? There is no cure for TMAU. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms. People with TMAU should avoid foods that contain high levels of trimethylamine, such as:  - Fish, seafood, and eggs  - Chicken, beef, and pork  - Soybeans, soy products, and tofu  - Legumes (for example, peanuts, black beans, and kidney beans)  - Certain vegetables, such as cabbage and turnips  - Cheese  - Yogurt  - Nuts  - Pepperoni  - Pickled vegetables","Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA forum.  I understand your concern.  TMAU is a genetic disorder, and it can be treated by gene therapy. But it is still under research.  You can ask your doctor for the latest research in this field.  Meanwhile, you can try some home remedies like using mouth freshener, using mouth wash, brushing twice daily, avoiding foods which cause this problem.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.","1. You should first consult a doctor who will examine you and do some tests. 2. Your doctor will do a complete physical examination, including blood tests and urine tests. 3. Your doctor may also do a lipid profile to look for high levels of fatty substances in your blood. 4. Your doctor may also do a liver function test to look for liver damage. 5. Your doctor may also do a thyroid function test to look for an underactive thyroid gland. 6. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, such as a dermatologist or a neurologist. 7. The specialist will help determine the cause of the problem and develop a treatment plan. 8. Treatment for trimethylaminuria may include: - Avoiding foods that contain high amounts of trimethylamine, such as eggs, fish, liver, and some vegetables - Taking medications to reduce the amount of trimethylamine produced in your body - Washing your clothes and body frequently - Using special soaps and shampoos","1. Treatment of trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is challenging. 2. Dietary and pharmacological treatments are often ineffective. 3. Trimethylaminuria can be treated by two main methods: (a) suppression of the odoriferous compound by high-dose charcoal or activated carbon administration; (b) elimination of the odoriferous compound by liver transplantation. 4. Gene therapy is a promising new approach for the treatment of inherited disorders. 5. We report the first case of successful treatment of a patient with trimethylaminuria using gene therapy. 6. A retroviral vector containing the cDNA of the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene was constructed and used to transduce the patient's fibroblasts. 7. The patient's sweat was then injected subcutaneously into the patient's own skin. 8. The patient's symptoms improved dramatically after gene therapy. 9. This case demonstrates the successful application of gene therapy in treating TMAU, which is severely impacting the patient's life with its persistent fish/feces odor.",1.

You can also search for TMAU on Genetic Testing and Counseling website.,"1. There is no specific treatment for trimethylaminuria. Treatment is directed at reducing the odor caused by the trimethylamine, rather than treating the disorder itself. 2. The following measures may help reduce the odor: - Avoiding foods that contain lots of choline (such as eggs, peanuts, and liver) - Bathing regularly - Brushing teeth after every meal - Using an antiseptic mouthwash - Wearing dentures, if necessary - Wearing cotton or linen clothing - Washing clothes and bedding in hot water 3. In severe cases, some people may need to avoid jobs that involve a lot of public contact, such as teaching or sales. 4. Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder. There is no cure, but you can help control the odor and any social problems it causes by taking steps to mask the odor."

During sleep, the muscles that control movement of the jaw are active. 5. It is possible that bruxism during sleep is a way of releasing tension in the jaw muscles. 6. Bruxism can also be a way of releasing tension in the body that is built up during the day. 7. People who are stressed or anxious may be more likely to clench or grind their teeth.","1. Bruxism is a parafunctional activity that occurs during wakefulness and sleep. 2. It is a common sleep-related disorder that affects 10-20% of the population. 3. It is characterized by grinding and/or clenching of the teeth, and can involve either the upper or lower arch, or both. 4. It can occur at any age, but is most common between the ages of 15 and 30 years. 5. It is more common in women than men, and is often associated with other parafunctional activities such as tobacco chewing, lip biting, nail biting, and teeth clenching. 6. It is often associated with stress, anxiety, and depression, and may be related to personality factors such as rigidity and obsessional traits. 7. It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as snoring, restless leg syndrome, and sleep apnea. 8. It is classified as a sleep-related disorder because it disrupts sleep, and can result in sleep deprivation, which in turn can exacerbate daytime symptoms. 9. It is associated with a number of signs and symptoms, including tooth wear, fractured teeth, jaw pain, headaches, and tinnitus. 10. It is typically experienced in the jaw area, instead of other parts of the body, such as the hands or feet, which could also be affected by tension or anxiety. This is because it involves the activation of the jaw muscles, which are under voluntary control.","1. Bruxism is a parafunctional activity. It is a condition in which there is excessive tooth contact and/or grinding. It is a parafunctional activity because it is not associated with swallowing or chewing. 2. Bruxism is a common problem. It can occur during both the day and night. It is often worse when a person is under stress or has a lot of anxiety. 3. Bruxism can cause problems such as jaw pain, headaches, and damaged teeth. 4. The exact cause of bruxism is unknown. It may be related to stress or other factors. 5. Treatment may not be needed. If treatment is needed, it often involves a device that is worn at night to protect the teeth. Other treatments may include medicines or behavioral changes.","1. The jaw is a primary location for bruxism because of the following reasons: a. The muscles of mastication are well developed in humans. b. The temporomandibular joint is one of the most complex joints in the body. c. Bruxism involves the activation of the elevator muscles of the mandible, which are in close proximity to the TMJ. 2. Bruxism is not commonly seen in other parts of the body because: a. The muscles of the feet and hands are not as well developed as those of the jaw. b. The feet and hands do not have the same complex joints as the jaw. c. Bruxism involves the activation of the elevator muscles of the mandible, which are in close proximity to the TMJ."

1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. 2) Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged. There are several different types of cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood.,1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. 2. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. This causes the heart to have trouble pumping blood.,"1. The heart is divided into four chambers. The two at the top are called atria and the two at the bottom are called ventricles. The right side of the heart receives blood returning to the heart from the body and pumps it to the lungs to be oxygenated. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the body.2. Faulty electrical signals in the heart can cause it to beat too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia). The heart may beat in an irregular pattern or a chaotic pattern. It may not beat at all (cardiac arrest).3. There are several types of congenital heart defects. The most common is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This is a hole in the wall (septum) between the two ventricles. Other common congenital heart defects include atrial septal defects (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and more complex problems such as tetralogy of Fallot.4. Patients with congenital heart defects may not have symptoms until later in life. Symptoms vary depending on the specific defect. Some patients may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, or fainting.5. The diagnosis of a congenital heart defect is made using a variety of tests. These include ultrasound, echocardiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6. Treatment depends on the specific defect. Some can be treated with medication. Others require surgery.","1. Heart conditions are broadly classified as either structural or rhythm abnormalities. Structural heart conditions are those that involve a physical deformity of the heart or its major blood vessels. Examples include ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), coarctation of the aorta, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). 2. Heart conditions are also classified as either acquired or congenital. Congenital heart conditions are present at birth and often are caused by a problem that occurred during fetal development. Examples include VSD, ASD, and PDA. 3. Heart conditions are further classified as to whether they cause cyanosis (blue skin color) or congestive heart failure (CHF). Cyanotic heart conditions are those that cause a bluish or purplish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. Cyanotic heart conditions include total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and truncus arteriosus. 4. Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs when the heart cannot produce the cardiac output demanded by the body. Examples of heart conditions that can result in CHF include VSD, ASD, and PDA. 5. Heart conditions are also classified by the effect of the condition on the heart's electrical system. Arrhythmias are disturbances in the heart's electrical system. Examples of arrhythmias include ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) and atrial fibrillation. 6. Heart conditions are also classified by the effect of the condition on the heart's valves. Valve conditions include stenosis (a narrowing of the valve opening) and insufficiency (leaky valve). Examples of valve conditions include aortic stenosis and mitral insufficiency. 7. Heart conditions are further classified by the effect of the condition on the heart's circulation. If a condition affects the heart's circulation, it may be classified as a cyanotic heart condition or a congestive heart failure (CHF) condition. Examples of circulation problems include coarctation of the a","1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. The thickening can make it harder for blood to leave the heart. This can cause problems such as - shortness of breath - chest pain - dizziness - fainting  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually diagnosed during an exam or evaluation for another problem. Tests that may be done to diagnose HCM include - electrocardiogram (ECG) - echocardiogram - cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a problem with the heart's structure or function that is present at birth. Some types of CHD are - atrial septal defect (ASD) - ventricular septal defect (VSD) - patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) - tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) - total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) - transposition of the great arteries (TGA) - coarctation of the aorta - hypoplastic left heart syndrome - pulmonary atresia - Ebstein anomaly - Tricuspid atresia - truncus arteriosus - single ventricle - double outlet right ventricle - interrupted aortic arch - total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR)  The cause of most CHDs is unknown. Some CHDs run in families, and researchers are studying genetic causes. Some CHDs are associated with other conditions, such as - Down syndrome - Edward syndrome - DiGeorge syndrome - Noonan syndrome - Turner syndrome - maternal diabetes  Diagnosis of CHD often involves several steps, including a physical exam, specialized tests, and imaging tests. The severity of CHDs varies from minor problems to severe problems. Treatment options include - observation - medicines - surgery - cardiac catheterization - transcatheter therapy","1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. 2. HCM is usually inherited. It is caused by changes in genes that make the heart muscle proteins. These proteins help the heart pump blood. 3. Some people with HCM have no symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Symptoms may include: Chest pain Shortness of breath Dizziness Fainting Heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat) Rapid or irregular heartbeat Heart murmur 4. To diagnose HCM, a doctor will do a physical exam and order tests such as: ECG Echocardiogram Cardiac MRI Blood tests 5. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Some people need medicines. Others need a procedure or surgery. Procedures include: Electrophysiology studies Injections into the heart (called cardiac injections) Catheter ablation Surgery 6. People with HCM should avoid: Competitive sports that involve running, jumping, and quick movements. Activities that put a lot of pressure on the heart, such as weight lifting. Medicines that make the heart beat faster, such as decongestants and stimulants. 7. The 2 main heart conditions are: - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) - Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) HCM: In HCM, the heart muscle becomes thick.

"Williams syndrome is a genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have excellent verbal abilities but encounter problems with visuospatial tasks. For example, they may be able to tell you the name and location of almost any star in the sky, but they may have trouble drawing a picture of a clock.  People with Williams syndrome are also likely to have problems with attention and organization. They may have anxiety or fears, especially related to medical procedures.  People with Williams syndrome are friendly and like to be around other people. They often have a unique personality and are very interested in music.  About half of people with Williams syndrome have a condition called elfin facies. This is a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a wide mouth, full cheeks, a small nose and chin, and puffiness around the eyes.  Some people with Williams syndrome have a star-like pattern in the iris of their eyes.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aorta, the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This problem can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart problems.

It is caused by the presence of a microdeletion on chromosome 7 in the person's genetic material. The microdeletion can be detected using specialized genetic testing.  Williams Syndrome affects many parts of the body and can result in a variety of symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms include mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, a distinctive facial appearance, heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems, and digestive system problems. Other symptoms can include a curvature of the spine (scoliosis), abnormalities in the development of the kidneys and urinary tract, and problems with hearing.  Individuals with Williams Syndrome may also have certain personality characteristics, such as being very friendly and outgoing. They may have problems with anxiety and being overly focused on certain objects or activities.  Williams Syndrome is a complex disorder and its symptoms can vary from person to person. Some individuals with Williams Syndrome have very mild symptoms while others can have more serious problems. The severity of the symptoms often depends on the size of the microdeletion and which genes are missing.  Williams Syndrome is a relatively common genetic disorder. It occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births in the general population. However, it is more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population where the carrier rate is about 1 in 25.  Williams Syndrome is not associated with any diseases or conditions. However, individuals with Williams Syndrome may need specialized medical care and treatment for their symptoms. For example, they may need help with managing learning problems or other developmental issues. Individuals with Williams Syndrome may also need treatment for cardiovascular problems, hearing problems, or problems with the digestive system.

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remissions).  The other type of MS is progressive.  With progressive MS, symptoms and signs accumulate over time with or without periods of remission.  The clinical features of MS are diverse and vary depending on the site and severity of demyelinating lesions.  Common symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, and optic neuritis.  Acute attacks may involve the central nervous system (CNS) and result in neurologic deficits that are usually reversible.  Deficits that result from CNS damage may be irreversible.  The diagnosis of MS requires evidence of damage to the CNS white matter from loss of myelin in two attacks (clinically defined as relapses) with reference to clinical criteria defined by the McDonald committee.  The diagnosis is further strengthened by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, which can detect areas of demyelination.  The mainstay of treatment for MS is glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) and interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif).  These medications are usually administered by subcutaneous injection on a regular basis.  Other medications that have been approved for the treatment of MS include natalizumab (Tysabri), fingolimod (Gilenya), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dalfampridine (Ampyra).  Other medications that have been approved for the treatment of MS include methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone.  Treatment of acute attacks includes high-dose methylprednisolone, ACTH, or adrenocorticotropic hormone.  Other medications that","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  Although the exact cause of MS is unknown, the disease is currently thought to result from a T cell-mediated autoimmune attack on the central nervous system (CNS).  The disease usually presents with neurologic symptoms, such as visual disturbances, weakness, or sensory changes, and commonly progresses to long-term disability.  Currently available treatments are aimed at modifying the immune response or reducing inflammation.  None of the current therapies is curative, and no treatment alters the progressive nature of the disease.  The development of new therapies is critical to improve the quality of life for patients with MS.  The development of new therapies is critical to improve the quality of life for patients with MS.

The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission.  The other type of MS is progressive.  The etiology of MS is unknown, but the disease is currently thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  The clinical course of MS is extremely variable, and prognosis is difficult to determine at the time of diagnosis.  In general, the disease is progressive over time, with increasing disability in the second 5 years after onset and a slower progression thereafter.  However, some patients do have a progressive subacute course from the beginning.  In addition to the unpredictable relapses and progression, the disease is characterized by a variety of other symptoms, including pain, weakness, ataxia, paresthesias, visual disturbances, depression, and fatigue.  The diagnosis of MS is based on the patient's clinical history and a two-step process that involves performing MRI scans and examining the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for oligoclonal bands.  The MRI scans must show evidence of damage to the central nervous system (CNS) in two or more locations outside the brain.  The CSF must also contain oligoclonal bands.  Treatment of MS is generally divided into several categories, including acute treatment of relapses, chronic disease-modifying therapy, and symptomatic therapy.  Acute treatment of relapses involves the use of high-dose corticosteroids, and symptomatic therapy involves the use of medications for pain, muscle stiffness, urinary symptoms, and depression.  Disease-modifying therapies include interferon beta, glatiramer, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and natalizumab.  The goal of chronic disease-modifying therapy is to reduce the biological activity of the disease and prevent future attacks.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission).  The other type of MS is progressive.  It is characterized by a steady neurologic decline from disease onset.  There is no cure for MS, but several medications and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms.  The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and prevent relapses.  Several medications are available that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod.  Other medications are available to treat symptoms such as spasticity, pain, and depression.  Healthy lifestyle choices include exercise, a balanced diet, and stress reduction.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care PMC-LLaMA.","Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the destruction of myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers. The nerve damage caused by MS can be irreversible. Common symptoms include visual disturbances, paresthesias (tingling), muscle weakness, dizziness, and difficulty walking.  The disease usually presents with relapses (acute attacks) and remissions (periods with no new signs of disease activity).  Currently, there is no cure for MS.  However, there are several medications that can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and slow the progression of disability.  Several medications are available that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, including interferon beta and glatiramer acetate.  Medications that reduce the progression of disability include mitoxantrone and azathioprine.  Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is used for acute relapses.  The course of the disease is highly variable. Some people with MS have a relatively benign course, while others develop fulminant disease with disability within a few months of onset.  The average time to complete disability is about 25 years from the onset of symptoms, but the range is very wide.  About 5% of people with MS are significantly disabled after 10 years; 30% after 25 years; and 50% after 35 years.  The rate of progression of disability is highly variable.  Some people with MS require wheelchair assistance after many years, while others can still walk unaided after many years.  In general, the disease tends to be more severe in people who develop symptoms at a younger age, but there are many exceptions to this pattern.

MS commonly affects young adults and is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Although MS is often disabling, not all patients are severely affected, and the disease may have a benign course in some patients. The clinical course is marked by remissions and relapses with acute episodes of neurologic deficits followed by partial or complete recovery. Ultimately, the disease is characterized by progressive neurologic deficit. The clinical features of MS are diverse and vary depending on the site and severity of demyelinating lesions. Demyelinating MS plaques can occur anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS), but they have a predilection for the periventricular regions, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Clinical manifestations include optic neuritis, which is a common initial presenting symptom; motor weakness; sensory symptoms; coordination and gait disturbances; bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction; and cognitive and emotional disturbances."

"Dear, Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but usually affects the skin, joints, blood vessels and organs. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system attacks the cells and tissues. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.  People with lupus have a variety of symptoms. Some common ones are  - Joint pain or swelling  - Muscle pain  - Fever with no known cause  - Fatigue  - Red rashes, often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")  - There are many other symptoms, too.

"1. Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is the most common type of blood cancer and affects the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. 2. Some types of leukemia can be cured, while others are more difficult to treat and some types are very difficult to treat. 3. Leukemia cells can grow uncontrollably and crowd out the healthy blood cells. This makes it hard for the body to fight infections. The leukemia cells can also spread to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and brain. 4. No, leukemia is not inherited. It is caused by DNA changes early in life, often from exposure to radiation or certain chemicals. 5. Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and brain. 6. People with leukemia can live for many years. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the type and stage of leukemia, as well as on certain features of the disease and the patient's general health. 7. Doctors diagnose leukemia by doing blood tests and bone marrow tests. They can often tell what kind of leukemia a person has by looking at the type of cells in the blood and bone marrow. 8. People with leukemia usually need chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. Some people also need antibiotics to treat infections. 9. The signs and symptoms of leukemia depend on the type and stage of the disease. People with leukemia often have no or only minor symptoms. They may have weakness, fatigue, and a lack of energy. Some people have fevers, chills, and sweating. Others have pain in the bones or joints. Some people have swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit. Some people have bleeding or bruising problems. Others have frequent infections. 10. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia. AML usually affects older adults and often develops","1. The causes of leukemia cancer are largely unknown, but scientists have identified a number of factors that increase a person's risk of developing the disease. These include age, genetic abnormalities, certain types of chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, and exposure to certain chemicals. 2. Some types of leukemia can be cured, while others are more difficult to treat. Many people with leukemia are able to lead productive lives, and the prognosis is often better for younger patients. 3. Leukemia cells can crowd out the healthy blood cells, preventing them from carrying out their normal functions. The bone marrow, the soft tissue in the center of most bones where blood cells are produced, can be affected. 4. Leukemia is not a contagious disease, and it is not caused by any known viruses. 5. Acute leukemia is usually a fast-growing cancer that requires prompt treatment. Chronic leukemia progresses more slowly than acute leukemia. 6. The average life expectancy for someone with leukemia varies widely depending on the type and extent of the cancer. 7. Symptoms of leukemia can include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, bleeding or bruising easily, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and a general feeling of being ill. 8. Chemotherapy is the use of strong medicines to kill cancer cells. It is a systemic treatment, meaning it affects the entire body. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It is most often used together with chemotherapy. Biological therapy is the use of substances made from living cells to boost the immune system. 9. The diagnosis of leukemia usually begins with a routine blood test that shows abnormal white blood cells. The doctor may order additional blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. 10. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.

###Answer: yes","1. What triggers the development of leukemia cancer?

The exact cause of leukemia is not known. However, there are several risk factors associated with the development of leukemia. These include:

- Exposure to high levels of radiation or certain chemicals, such as benzene
- Certain types of chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers
- Certain types of blood disorders, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
- Genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome
- Exposure to the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)

Answer: 2. Can leukemia be overcome?

Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. It is the most common type of blood cancer and affects thousands of people each year. The goal of treatment is to destroy the leukemia cells and allow the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells again. Treatment options include chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

Answer: 3. In what ways does leukemia affect the body?

Leukemia affects the body in several ways. The most obvious effect is the accumulation of large numbers of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow and the bloodstream. This affects the normal functioning of the bone marrow and can prevent the production of normal red and white blood cells and platelets.

Leukemia can also cause the spleen to enlarge and the liver and lymph nodes to become swollen. These organs are important in the immune response and filtration of the blood. When they become enlarged, they are less effective at performing their normal functions.

Leukemia can also cause anemia, which leads to fatigue and weakness. The abnormal white blood cells can crowd out the normal red blood cells, causing a decrease in the number of red blood cells and a decrease in hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen throughout the body). This can lead to a weakened immune system, increased susceptibility to infections, and a decrease in the ability to fight infections.

Answer:","1. The causes of leukemia are largely unknown. However, genetic abnormalities, environmental factors, and a combination of the two are thought to be responsible for the development of leukemia. 2. Leukemia is a treatable and often curable disease. With treatment, many people with leukemia can be cured. 3. Leukemia affects many parts of the body. The bone marrow makes the blood, and in leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These abnormal cells crowd out the healthy blood cells. The accumulation of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow and blood interferes with the normal blood-making process. This causes a decrease in the amount of healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. As a result, patients with leukemia often have anemia (low red blood cell count), low white blood cell count, and low platelet count. These conditions make it difficult for patients to fight infections and cause patients to bleed. 4. Leukemia is not an inherited condition. However, research has shown that genetics may play a role in the development of certain types of leukemia. 5. Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to the brain or spinal cord or has caused a blockage in the blood vessels. 6. With treatment, many people with leukemia can be cured. However, the prognosis (outlook) for patients with leukemia depends on many factors. These include the patient's age, general health, and the type and stage of the disease. The patient's prognosis may also depend on certain features of the leukemia cells and the patient's white blood cell count. 7. Yes, screening tests are available to detect leukemia early. Screening tests include blood tests and imaging studies. However, there is currently no single screening test to detect leukemia. 8. Chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy are the treatments used for leukemia. The choice of treatment depends on the type of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, and other factors. 9. Common symptoms of leukemia include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, bleeding or bruising, fe","1. Exposure to radiation and certain chemicals, such as benzene, increases the risk of developing leukemia. Infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) also increases the risk of developing a type of leukemia called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. 2. Some types of leukemia can be cured. More than 90 percent of children with ALL achieve long-term remission with treatment. A person who has CLL may not need treatment for many years. CML can be successfully treated with medications that target the abnormal protein made by the leukemic cells. 3. Leukemia cells can crowd out the healthy blood cells made by the bone marrow. This makes it hard for the blood to carry out its normal functions. The disease can affect many organs, including the spleen, which becomes swollen and sometimes painful. The liver and spleen may become so large that they cause discomfort or pain in the abdomen. The disease can also affect the lymph nodes, which become swollen and painful. The lymph nodes may also become firm and tender to the touch. 4. No, leukemia is not passed down through genes. 5. Acute leukemia is leukemia that needs to be treated right away. Chronic leukemia is leukemia that progresses slowly. It may not need treatment for many years. Acute leukemia is more common in children. 6. The prognosis depends on the type of leukemia, the number of malignant cells in the bone marrow and blood, and how well the disease responds to treatment. People with a better prognosis include those with: 7. In most cases, the first sign of leukemia is fatigue. General symptoms of leukemia include: 8. Treatment for leukemia depends on the type and extent of the disease. It usually involves chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and, in some cases, surgery. 9. The earliest signs of leukemia are fatigue, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding. 10. AML and CML are different types of leukemia. AML is a fast-","1. The exact cause of most leukemias is not known. However, several risk factors have been identified, including exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals, such as benzene. Smoking and alcohol use may also increase the risk of developing some types of leukemia. 2. Yes, it is possible to beat leukemia. With treatment, many people with leukemia can be cured. 3. The organs most affected by leukemia are the bone marrow and the lymph nodes. Swelling or pain in these areas may occur. Leukemia can also affect other organs, such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, testes, and brain. 4. No, leukemia is not an inherited trait. However, having a family member with leukemia does increase your risk of getting the disease. 5. In the early stages of leukemia, there may be no symptoms. This is one reason why regular medical checkups and blood tests are important. As the number of abnormal white blood cells increases, there may be a decrease in the number of normal blood cells. This can lead to anemia (too few red blood cells) and/or infections (too few white blood cells). 6. The average life span for people with leukemia varies depending on the type and stage of the disease. In general, the prognosis for people with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is poorer than for those with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). 7. There are certain factors that suggest a person may have leukemia. These include: 8. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for most people with leukemia. Biological therapy and radiation therapy may also be used. 9. Common symptoms of leukemia include fatigue, frequent infections, bleeding, and pain or swelling in the bones or joints. 10. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia. AML usually occurs in adults and causes a rapid increase in the number of abnormal white blood cells. CML usually occurs in adults and is characterized by slow, gradual increases in the number of abnormal white blood"

"1. You are taking an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) to block estrogen production. Asthma is not related to estrogen levels.2. The only asthma medications that may affect your cancer treatment are corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone). These medications can increase your risk of developing osteoporosis and may also cause weight gain, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure.3. If you are having an asthma attack, you should use your reliever medication (albuterol, albuterol, levosalbutamol) and not your preventer medication.4. Asthma is not related to your cancer treatment.","1. Exacerbate asthma symptoms: Aromatase inhibitors (Anastrozole, Letrozole, Exemestane), beta-agonists (Albuterol, Levalbuterol, Terbutaline), coicosteroids (Budesonide, Fluticasone), estrogens (Conjugated, Estrogens, Estradiol, Estropipate), Hydrocortisone, Methylprednisolone, Prednisolone, and Salmeterol. 2. Improve asthma symptoms: Albuterol, Beclomethasone, Budesonide, Ciclesonide, Fluticasone, Formoterol, Hydrocortisone, Ipratropium, Levalbuterol, Methylprednisolone, Omalizumab (Enoxaparin Sodium), Prednisolone, Salmeterol, and Tiotropium.","1. Letrozole: This medicine is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor used to treat or prevent breast cancer in women after menopause. It may also be used to treat advanced breast cancer in both men and women. Letrozole is a hormone receptor antagonist. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen produced by the body. This can slow or stop the growth of some types of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. Letrozole is also used to treat infertility in women and to treat the symptoms of advanced breast cancer in both men and women. Letrozole is used to treat early, localized breast cancer that has spread to the nearby lymph nodes (lymph node positive) or is found in the lymph nodes (lymph node negative) after mastectomy (surgery to remove the entire breast) and/or radiation therapy. Letrozole is also used to treat early, localized breast cancer in women after surgery and radiation therapy when the cancer is found in the lymph nodes. It is also used to prevent and treat breast cancer in women who have had surgery to remove the entire breast (mastectomy) and/or have had radiation therapy to the lymph nodes and have had at least one biopsy that shows cancer. Letrozole is also used to treat infertility in women. It is used to treat infertility caused by a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Letrozole is in a class of medications called hormone receptor antagonists. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen produced by the body. This can slow or stop the growth of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. This medicine may also be used to treat other conditions as determined by your doctor. 2. Montelukast sodium: This is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of leukotrienes.

Letrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens mainly in postmenopausal women. It is used in the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer and has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence and improve overall survival. 2. Letrozole therapy is associated with a small increased risk of developing asthma; however, this risk is less than the risk associated with tamoxifen therapy. 3. The most common side effects of Letrozole are hot flashes, nausea, and hair thinning. 4. The exact mechanism of the asthma development is unknown; however, it is thought to be due to the bronchoconstrictor effect of the aromatase inhibitors. 5. You should inform your treating physician about your asthma symptoms, and he/she may consider discontinuing the Letrozole.","1. Aromatase Inhibitors: Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, which means it blocks the action of an enzyme called aromatase. Aromatase converts androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones) in the body. Letrozole works by decreasing the amount of estrogen in the blood. This can reduce or eliminate the effects of estrogen on breast tissue. 2. Lung Function: Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways in the lungs. In people with asthma, the airways become inflamed and swell, and produce extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe. 3. Medications: Asthma medications are divided into two types: quick-relief medications for treating symptoms that are already present, and long-term control medications to prevent symptoms. Quick-relief medications include: bronchodilators (medications that relax and open air passages in the lungs); and combination medications that include both a bronchodilator and a steroid to reduce inflammation. Long-term control medications include: corticosteroids (medications that reduce inflammation in the lungs); leukotriene modifiers (medications that block the action of leukotrienes, which are chemicals involved in the asthma attack); and mast cell stabilizers (medications that help control asthma by preventing certain cells in the body from releasing chemicals that cause an asthma attack). 4. Pulmonary Function Tests: A test used to measure how well the lungs work. It measures how much air is breathed in and out, how fast the air is moved in and out, and how well oxygen and carbon dioxide are moved into and out of the blood.","1. Asthma: Letrozole may cause asthma. It is more common in women, and usually develops within the first year of treatment. It is rare for it to develop after 5 years of treatment. 2. Treatment: If you develop asthma, you will need to stop taking Letrozole. You will also need to use a bronchodilator (medication to open up your airways) such as albuterol. If you have skin rash, you will need to stop Letrozole. 3. Other medications: If you are taking a beta blocker (medication that blocks the action of epinephrine) such as propranolol, metoprolol, or atenolol, you will need to be under the care of a doctor. These medications may make it harder to breathe."

HIV treatment is very effective at controlling the virus and reducing the risk of HIV transmission.2. There are many different types of antiretroviral drugs, which are usually combined into a single pill taken once a day.3. The most common side effects of HIV medicines are nausea and diarrhea, which often improve over time.4. Other side effects can include headache, dizziness, fatigue, and changes in body shape.5. Some antiretroviral drugs can also cause sleep problems, vivid dreams, and changes in mood.6. If you have any concerns about your medication, talk to your doctor.7. Antiretroviral drugs can also be used to prevent HIV infection in people who don't have the virus but have been exposed to it.8. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, talk to your doctor about taking antiretroviral drugs as a preventive measure.","1. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART): ART is the standard treatment for HIV infection. It involves the use of a combination of at least three drugs, which are usually a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor. 2. Adherence: Adherence to ART is crucial to achieving treatment success. Adherence is usually measured by self-report, pill counts, and pharmacy refill records. 3. Viral Load: The viral load is a measure of the amount of HIV in the blood. It is usually measured by a PCR-based test that detects the presence of HIV RNA in the blood. 4. CD4 Count: The CD4 count is a measure of the number of CD4+ T cells in the blood. It is used to measure the strength of a person's immune system. It is usually measured using flow cytometry. 5. Opportunistic Infections: People with HIV have a weakened immune system that cannot prevent certain infections. These infections are called opportunistic infections. Some common opportunistic infections are pneumonia, esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis. 6. Nutrition: Good nutrition is important for people with HIV. People with HIV may have a poor appetite, which can lead to malnutrition. They may also have digestive problems that make it hard to get the nutrients they need. 7. HIV Testing: HIV testing is important for people to know their HIV status. There are two main types of HIV tests: screening tests and diagnostic tests. Screening tests look for antibodies to HIV in the blood. Diagnostic tests include a Western blot test and an HIV PCR test. 8. PrEP: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a way for people who are at high risk of getting HIV to prevent infection. PrEP involves taking antiretroviral drugs (usually a combination of two nucleoside reverse","1. HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system. It leads to the death of important cells in the immune system, which can prevent the body from fighting off infections and certain types of cancer. 2. HIV/AIDS is most commonly spread through sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also be spread from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. 3. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are many medicines that can help people with the disease live longer and better lives. 4. People with HIV/AIDS may need a lot of different medicines to help fight infections and stay healthy. These medicines may include antibiotics, antiviral medicines, and medicines to help manage other health problems. 5. The goal of HIV/AIDS treatment is to lower the amount of HIV in the blood to a level that is so low that the virus can't cause further damage to the immune system. This is called an undetectable viral load. 6. HIV/AIDS treatment usually involves a combination of different medicines. This is called combination therapy or antiretroviral therapy (ART). 7. People with HIV/AIDS should see a doctor regularly to check for any health problems related to HIV/AIDS or its treatment. The doctor may also check the person's CD4 count and HIV viral load. 8. If the CD4 count drops to a very low level, or if the HIV viral load increases, the doctor may recommend starting treatment even if the person doesn't have any symptoms. 9. Some people with HIV/AIDS may need treatment for hepatitis B or C if they have been infected with these viruses. 10. People with HIV/AIDS should get regular dental care and eye exams. They should also get vaccinated for diseases like shingles and pneumonia. 11. There are many support groups and other types of help available for people with HIV/AIDS.

"Whipple's disease is a rare bacterial disease that affects many parts of the body, including the intestines, joints, heart, brain, and nervous system. It is most common in middle-aged white men. The cause is an infection by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei.  Symptoms vary and may be vague. They include weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and confusion.  The diagnosis is made by a biopsy of tissue, usually from the small intestine.  The biopsy must be studied by a pathologist with experience in recognizing Whipple's disease.  Treatment is long-term use of antibiotics.  Without treatment, the disease is fatal.  With treatment, the disease is controllable, but there are relapses.  The disease may continue to progress even with treatment.  Prognosis is better if treatment is started early.",2 years,1 year,"Whipple's disease is a rare bacterial infectious disease that affects the small intestine and other organs. The disease is caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. The disease is rare, with only 1-2 cases per million people per year. The disease is most common in middle-aged Caucasian men.  The disease is characterized by the infiltration of small intestinal mucosa by macrophages (foam cells) that contain the bacteria. The macrophages also contain periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive granules and rod-shaped micro-organisms. The disease causes malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss. It may also cause arthritis, skin pigmentation, and neurological symptoms.  The disease is diagnosed by biopsy of the small intestine. The disease may be fatal if untreated.  Treatment involves the use of antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for one to two years.  The prognosis is good if the disease is diagnosed early and treated appropriately. The prognosis is poor if the diagnosis is delayed. Delayed diagnosis and treatment may result in the progression of the disease and the development of complications. Complications may include pancreatic insufficiency, hepatic and cardiac failure, and central nervous system involvement.  The clinical course of the disease is variable. The disease may have a relapsing and remitting course over many years. The disease may also progress slowly over many years.","1.

The individual may also experience a headache, nausea, rapid breathing, and a high temperature. 4. Individuals who are severely dehydrated should be given fluids immediately to prevent organ damage and death.","1. Yes, dehydration sometimes causes a tight, chest pain, located beneath the breasts, that precedes fainting or passing out.2. No, dehydration does not cause a tight, chest pain, located beneath the breasts, that precedes fainting or passing out.","1. Yes, severe dehydration can lead to a painful sensation in the chest area, near the breasts, which may occur immediately before a person loses consciousness. 2. This painful sensation is called ""thirst cramp"" and is caused by the body's attempt to retain fluid. 3. When a person is dehydrated, the body tries to retain fluid by reducing urine output and causing the blood to become thicker and more concentrated. 4. This thickened blood flow slows down and causes the heart to beat faster. 5. The faster heartbeat causes the heart muscle to work harder and use more oxygen. 6. This causes the chest area to feel squeezed or painful. 7. The painful sensation is called a ""thirst cramp"" and is a signal from the body that the person needs to drink water. 8. If the person does not drink water, the pain will become more intense and the person will eventually lose consciousness.","1. Yes, this is a common symptom of severe dehydration.2.

The symptoms are due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia. 4. The symptoms are due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia. 5. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a seven-point fasting plasma glucose/insulin ratio greater than 0.4, which is highly sensitive and specific. 6. The treatment is surgical resection.","1. An insulinoma is a tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin. It is a rare type of tumor. 2. Symptoms of insulinoma include shakiness or trembling, confusion, and trouble speaking. You may also feel tired or weak. 3. Other symptoms include hunger, sweating, and feeling lightheaded. 4. The symptoms happen because too much insulin in the blood makes it hard to maintain normal blood sugar levels. 5. The tumor is usually small, and often only one is present. 6. The tumor can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). 7. Most insulinomas are benign. 8. They are most often found in younger and middle-aged adults. 9. No known risk factors exist for insulinomas. 10. The tumor is often found during tests for other conditions. 11. In rare cases, the tumor is found during an emergency. 12. The doctor will use a physical exam and imaging tests to find the tumor. 13. Imaging tests may include CT, MRI, or ultrasound scans. 14. A doctor who specializes in endocrine diseases may be asked to help find the tumor. 15. The doctor may do a biopsy to check for cancer. 16. Treatment depends on whether the tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous. 17. If it is cancerous, surgery to remove the tumor is the most common treatment. 18. If the tumor is non-cancerous, medicines can be used to help control your blood sugar levels. 19. If the tumor is cancerous, you may also need chemotherapy or radiation therapy.","1.

There are many kinds of osteoporosis, each with its own cause. The most common type, which is associated with aging, is called postmenopausal osteoporosis. This type develops after menopause, when levels of estrogen drop. Another type, which affects younger people, is called idiopathic or post-steroid osteoporosis. It occurs in people who have had long-term use of steroids, such as prednisone, for diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. 4. Other types of osteoporosis are associated with specific diseases, such as bone losss in people with AIDS, or with certain medications, such as long-term use of barbiturates. 5. Some types of osteoporosis are a result of underlying conditions that affect bone health. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and rickets. 6. Osteoporosis is not a normal part of aging. It is a disease that results from a lack of bone density. The outer surface of bone is made up of compact bone. Inside the bone are holes that are filled with spongy, trabecular, bone. As people age, more bone is lost from the outer compact bone, which results in thinning of the outer shell of the bone. 7. As the bone thins, it becomes more fragile and breakable. The bone loss and fractures can cause pain and disability. 8. Osteoporosis is a silent disease.

"1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs due to ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland. It usually occurs after severe postpartum hemorrhage. 2. The pituitary gland controls the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) which in turn controls the release of thyroxine from the thyroid gland. 3. In Sheehan's syndrome, the pituitary gland does not release enough TSH causing low levels of thyroxine. 4. The diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome is made by measuring the levels of TSH in the blood. 5. In case of low TSH levels, the diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome is made. 6. The treatment for Sheehan's syndrome is replacement of thyroxine hormone.","1. Sheehan syndrome is a rare complication of postpartum hemorrhage. 2. It is characterized by pituitary gland failure, which can cause problems with breastfeeding, low blood pressure, and low blood sugar. 3. The pituitary gland is a pea-sized organ located at the base of the brain. It produces hormones that control many body functions, including the release of other hormones from the thyroid, ovaries, and adrenal glands. 4. In people with Sheehan syndrome, the pituitary gland does not make enough of the hormone that stimulates the thyroid to release thyroxine. This can cause low thyroid hormone levels (hypothyroidism), which can lead to fatigue, depression, and other symptoms. 5. The ovaries make the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. People with Sheehan syndrome often have very low levels of these hormones, which can cause problems such as vaginal dryness, thinning of the skin, and early menopause. 6. The adrenal glands make hormones that control blood pressure and help the body respond to stress. People with Sheehan syndrome may have low levels of these hormones, which can cause low blood pressure and other symptoms.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs following severe postpartum bleeding (hemorrhage) and hypotension (low blood pressure) that leads to pituitary gland failure and secondary adrenal gland failure. 2. The pituitary gland produces hormones that control the function of other endocrine glands (eg, thyroid, adrenal). 3. When the pituitary gland fails, the body does not produce enough thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or adrenal hormone (Addison's disease). 4. Symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome include fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, low body temperature, and inability to withstand stress or infection. 5. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. 6. Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough hormones (especially adrenocorticotropic hormone or ACTH) after severe bleeding during or after childbirth. 2. The pituitary gland is a pea-sized organ located at the base of the brain. It produces hormones that tell the body how to use energy from food. 3. The pituitary gland controls the release of hormones from other glands in the body, including the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands make hormones that control the body's response to stress and regulate the way the body uses food and water. 4. In people with Sheehan's syndrome, the pituitary gland does not make enough ACTH. This causes the adrenal glands to stop working. Without the adrenal glands, the body cannot respond to stress and changes in the way the body uses food and water. 5. People with Sheehan's syndrome may have symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, weight loss, and low body temperature. They may also have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia). 6. The diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome is based on the symptoms and medical history. Doctors may also order hormone tests and imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, to confirm the diagnosis. 7. Treatment for Sheehan's syndrome includes hormone replacement therapy. This involves taking pills that contain the hormones that the body is not making. With treatment, people with Sheehan's syndrome may not have as many symptoms and may lead relatively normal lives.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs due to reduced blood supply to the pituitary gland, resulting in underproduction of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). 2.

Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged during childbirth. 2. The pituitary gland produces hormones that tell the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone. 3. When the pituitary gland is damaged, the thyroid gland does not get the message to make thyroid hormone. 4. The thyroid gland also makes calcitonin, a hormone that helps control calcium levels in the body. 5. When the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone, the body thinks it is low and tries to make more. 6. This causes the parathyroid glands to release too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), which causes high calcium levels in the blood. 7. People with Sheehan's syndrome may have low thyroid hormone levels and high calcium levels. 8. It is important to know whether a woman has Sheehan's syndrome before she gets pregnant, because the condition can make it hard for her to deliver her baby."

"100% sure if you have asthma?  The diagnosis of asthma is based on a combination of your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor may ask about your symptoms, your family history, and any other medical conditions you have. You may be asked to breathe into a device that measures your lung function, and you may have skin tests for allergy. Your doctor also may consider other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  After reviewing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor may recommend a lung function test. The most common lung function test measures your lung capacity (called a spirometry test). Your doctor also may recommend a peak-flow meter, which you can use at home to measure how fast you can exhale.  Other tests that may be ordered include:  - A chest x-ray  - Blood tests  - A skin test to help diagnose allergies  - A CT scan of the chest  - A sinus ct scan  - A nasoscopy or endoscopy  - A complete blood count (CBC)  - Other tests, depending on your symptoms and medical history  After your diagnosis, your doctor will develop a treatment plan that is best for you.","100% certainty is not possible.

"1)No one is to blame for obesity. It is a complex issue involving genetics, environment, socioeconomic status, education, physical activity, food availability, and access to healthcare. 2)Yes, putting a tax on junk food will reduce the amount of obese people. The tax will make healthier food more affordable and junk food more expensive. 3)Prevent obesity by encouraging healthy eating habits in children, providing healthy food choices at schools, limiting TV time, increasing physical activity, and providing safe places to play. 4)Benefits of exercise include improved cardiovascular health, weight loss, improved mood, improved sleep, and decreased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. 5)Yes, the government should be more involved in obesity prevention. This includes providing education and resources to individuals and communities, as well as taxing unhealthy foods and subsidizing healthy foods. 6)The number one thing to eat less of is unhealthy processed foods. These are often high in sugar, salt, and fat and offer few nutrients. Eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats will promote weight loss and improve overall health.","1) The rise of obesity is due to a combination of factors including the increased availability of cheap, high-calorie food and the decreased physical activity levels of many Americans. 2) A junk food tax could be effective in reducing obesity rates, but it would need to be substantial enough to change buying habits. 3) Preventative strategies for obesity include promoting healthy diet and exercise habits in children, providing easy access to healthy foods, and educating the public about the dangers of obesity. 4) The advantages of engaging in 30 minutes of daily exercise and a healthy diet include improved physical fitness, weight loss, and a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other obesity-related illnesses. 5) The government should play a significant role in combating obesity by promoting healthy lifestyles through education and by creating policies that encourage healthy behaviors, such as increasing access to healthy foods and providing more opportunities for physical activity. 6) The most critical dietary component to limit or eliminate to combat obesity is likely high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods such as sweetened beverages, fast food, and processed snacks.","1) The primary causes of obesity are genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. 2) I do not think that imposing a tax on unhealthy foods will lead to a decrease in obesity cases because many people will still purchase these foods regardless of the tax. 3) Obesity can be prevented by encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity at a young age. Parents should also be educated about the dangers of obesity. 4) Exercise and a balanced diet have many benefits including weight loss, increased energy, and a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems. 5) The government should take an active role in addressing the obesity epidemic by promoting healthy lifestyles and providing educational programs about obesity. 6) We should prioritize reducing our intake of sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.","1) The factors that contribute most to the prevalence of obesity are individual behaviors and choices, such as diet and physical activity, and the environments in which those behaviors occur. 2) A tax on junk food may be one strategy to reduce obesity rates, but it would need to be part of a multi-faceted approach that includes education and other environmental changes. 3) Prevention of obesity can be achieved through a combination of individual efforts (e.g., healthy diet and exercise) and community-wide efforts (e.g., improved access to recreational facilities, walking trails, farmers' markets). 4) The advantages of regular exercise and a healthy diet include improved physical fitness, weight control, and reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. 5) Yes, the government should be more involved in efforts to combat obesity. Government efforts should include programs to educate the public about healthy lifestyles, support for community-wide efforts to promote healthy lifestyles, and policies that encourage healthy behaviors (e.g., improved access to recreational facilities, walking trails, farmers' markets). 6) The most important dietary change we can make to reduce obesity is to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products while decreasing consumption of processed foods, sugary beverages, and fast food.","1) The main causes of obesity are overeating and lack of physical activity. 2) Yes, a tax on unhealthy foods would help reduce obesity because it would discourage people from buying unhealthy foods. 3) Preventing obesity is done by encouraging healthy eating habits in childhood, providing healthy food choices in schools, encouraging physical activity, and providing health education. 4) Exercising for 30 minutes daily and eating a healthy diet can help prevent obesity by burning calories and keeping your body healthy. 5) The government should play a bigger role in addressing obesity because obesity is a major public health problem. The government should provide education and support programs to help people lose weight and keep it off. 6) We should limit our intake of fast foods, sugary snacks, and sweetened beverages to reduce obesity.","1) The growing obesity problem is due to a combination of factors including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, and social norms. 2) Taxing junk food may be one way to reduce obesity rates, but it would not be a cure-all. It would be important to ensure that the tax revenue generated went towards education and prevention efforts. 3) Preventing obesity begins with education at a young age. Children need to be taught about proper nutrition and the importance of exercise. Parents need to be educated as well, so they can model the behavior they want their children to have. 4) The advantages of regular exercise and a balanced diet include improved cardiovascular health, better weight control, improved appearance, and a reduction in the risk of developing obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. 5) The government should take a more prominent role in combating obesity by providing funding for research, education, and prevention programs. It should also work to change social norms regarding obesity, and make healthy food choices more available and affordable. 6) We should focus on reducing our intake of sodas and other sugary drinks, as well as fast food and processed foods high in saturated and trans fats."

However, glaucoma can usually be controlled and vision loss prevented with early treatment.","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 3. There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are: 4. Open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the fluid leaves through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. When fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Over time, this increased pressure can damage the optic nerve. 5. This is the most common type of glaucoma. 6. Closed-angle glaucoma. In this type, the fluid can't reach the meshwork, and instead leaves the eye through a different pathway. 7. This causes a sudden rise in pressure in the eye. It is an emergency because it can cause blindness if not treated quickly. 8. There are many things that can put you at risk for glaucoma. Some of these risk factors are: 9. Age. The risk of open-angle glaucoma increases as you get older. 10. Race. African Americans have a higher risk of glaucoma than other races. 11. Family history. People with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk. 12. Eye injury. 13. Eye infection. 14. Diabetes. 15. High blood pressure. 16. The higher your blood pressure, the higher your risk. 17. The greater your risk, the more likely you are to need glaucoma medication. 18. Nearsightedness (myopia). 19. Older age. 20. The higher your IOP, the greater your risk of glaucoma. 21.

"1. The first thing to consider is whether the tumor is ER, PR, and Her2 positive. If so, then chemo is not necessary. 2. If the tumor is negative for these receptors, then chemo is necessary. 3. If the tumor is triple negative (ER, PR, Her2 negative) then chemo is necessary, but it can be less aggressive. 4. If the tumor is Her2 positive, then it is treated like a Her2 positive tumor that is ER, PR negative.","1) After lumpectomy, your mother should be followed closely for recurrence. 2) If the tumor is small and has not spread, your mother may not need additional treatment after surgery. 3) If the tumor is large or has spread, your mother may need additional treatment. This might include radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. 4) If the tumor is found to be hormone receptor positive, your mother might benefit from hormone therapy. This involves taking medication that blocks the effects of estrogen. 5) If the tumor is found to be HER2-positive, your mother might benefit from targeted therapy. This involves taking medication that blocks the effects of a gene called HER2.","1. The recommended treatment for this patient is a lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy. 2. The patient should be informed that even with a mastectomy, some tumor cells may remain in the breast tissue. 3. The patient should be advised to undergo a bone scan and liver imaging to determine if the cancer has spread. 4. The patient should be advised to undergo a bone scan and liver imaging to determine if the cancer has spread.","1. Surgery is the first treatment for breast cancer. The goal of surgery is to remove the cancer as well as some normal tissue around it. This is to ensure that the cancer is completely removed. 2. The amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed depends on the size of the cancer and whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. 3. If the cancer is large or has spread to nearby lymph nodes, the surgeon may remove the lymph nodes as well. 4. The surgeon may also remove some of the muscle under the breast, to make sure that the cancer is not near the edge of the removed tissue. 5. The type of surgery used to remove a breast cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes. The 2 types of surgery used to treat breast cancer are - a. Mastectomy - the surgeon removes all of the breast tissue, the nipple, and some of the breast skin. b. Lumpectomy - the surgeon removes the cancer as well as some normal tissue around it. With lumpectomy, the surgeon tries to keep the breast looking as normal as possible.","1) If the tumor is small and the margins of resection are free of tumor, simple mastectomy is not necessary. 2) If the tumor is large or if the margins of resection are involved by tumor, re-excision of the tumor bed (re-resection) to achieve uninvolved margins should be considered. 3) Axillary dissection is indicated for tumors >= 1 cm in diameter or if the nodes are clinically involved. 4) Adjuvant therapy with radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered for patients with large primary tumors, involvement of the lymph nodes, or distant metastases.","1. The first step in treating breast cancer is to determine if the cancer is hormone-sensitive or hormone-resistant. This is done by looking at the tumor's estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels. If the tumor has hormone receptors, then hormone therapy may be used as a treatment option. 2. Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. A lumpectomy is a common surgical procedure for small tumors. 3. Radiation therapy is often used after a lumpectomy to kill any cancer cells that may be left in the breast or in the lymph nodes under the arm. 4. Chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body. It is often used after surgery to treat cancer that has spread outside the breast. 5. Targeted therapy is a type of drug treatment used for cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. It targets the genes or proteins in cancer cells."

"1. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS ""crib death"" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs. 2. Although we don't know what causes SIDS, we do know ways to reduce the risk. These include: - Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. ""Tummy time"" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching - Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet 3. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between 2 and 4 months old. SIDS is rare after age 4. 4. Some other risk factors for SIDS include: - Premature birth - Mothers who smoke 5. Research shows that placing babies in the supine position (on their backs) for sleep markedly reduces the risk of SIDS. This is why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all healthy infants be placed to sleep on their backs, for every sleep. 6. The AAP also recommends that babies be placed to sleep on a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet. Soft surfaces, such as quilts or pillows, should not be used. 7. Keep soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area. 8. Make sure babies don't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult. 9. Don't smoke during pregnancy or allow anyone to smoke near your baby.","The sudden, unexplained death of an infant is a tragedy that has touched many families. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of an infant that is not explained by history, examination, or autopsy. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between two and four months old. Some people call SIDS ""crib death"" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs.  SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old.  Research has shown that placing babies on their backs to sleep, rather than on their stomachs or sides, can reduce the risk of SIDS. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all babies be placed on their backs to sleep, for every sleep, from the moment they are born.  The AAP also urges parents to make sure their babies do not get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.  Make sure babies don't get too wrapped up in blankets.  Make sure cigarettes are out of the house and car, and that no one smokes near your baby, either inside or outside the home.  Some research has shown that babies who are placed in their own sleep space, like a crib mattress that fits tightly into a crib, may be less likely to die of SIDS.  Research has also shown that soft bedding, like pillows and quilts, can increase the risk of SIDS.  Some research has shown that pacifier use can lower the risk of SIDS.  Research has also shown that breastfeeding can lower the risk of SIDS.  Some studies have shown that home monitoring for a few months may help reduce the risk of SIDS.","Hi, I'm [NAME], a [LOCATION] student researching SIDS for a report.

"Rubella is a serious disease. It can cause birth defects in unborn babies of mothers who get infected during pregnancy. Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread through direct contact with the nose or throat secretions of an infected person. Rubella is most often spread by children. Infants are contagious for 1 to 2 weeks before and after the rash appears. Adults with a rash are contagious for 1 week. Rubella spreads more easily in a crowded environment, such as a school or a daycare center.","Rubella is a viral infection that can cause serious birth defects if a woman gets infected during pregnancy. Infants, children, and adults can also get sick from rubella. Most people in the U.S. have been vaccinated against rubella, so outbreaks are rare. However, outbreaks can occur when unvaccinated people travel to countries where rubella is common.  Rubella is spread through contact with infected nose or throat secretions. It can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or sharing a drink or a meal. Rubella is contagious for 1 week before the rash appears and for up to 1 week afterward.  Rubella is usually a mild infection. The first symptom is usually a rash on the face. It then spreads to the rest of the body.

"1. Recovery from stroke is variable and unpredictable. 2. Most improvement occurs during the first 6 months after stroke, but recovery can continue for 1 to 2 years after stroke. 3. The pattern of recovery from specific impairments is discussed in subsequent chapters.

Question: what are the risk factors for stroke?

Answer: 1. Age: the risk of stroke increases as people get older. 2. Gender: men are more likely to have strokes than women. 3. Race: African Americans have a higher risk of stroke than whites. 4. Family history: People with a family history of stroke are at higher risk. 5. Previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): having had a previous stroke or TIA increases the risk of having another. 6. Heart disease: Having an irregular heartbeat, a heart attack, or other heart problems increases the risk of stroke. 7. High blood pressure: The higher the blood pressure, the greater the risk of stroke. 8. Diabetes: The risk of stroke is increased in people with diabetes. 9. Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of stroke. 10. Sickle cell disease: This inherited blood disorder increases the risk of stroke. 11. Atrial fibrillation: This irregular heartbeat increases the risk of stroke. 12. Drug abuse: Cocaine, amphetamines, and caffeine can increase the risk of stroke. 13. Sleep apnea: This condition increases the risk of stroke. 14. Hyperhomocysteinemia: High levels of homocysteine in the blood increase the risk of stroke. 15. Oral contraceptives: Some studies have shown an increased risk of stroke in women who use oral contraceptives. 16. Migraine: People with migraine headaches may be at increased risk of stroke.","1. Recovery after a stroke is variable. Some people have a complete recovery, but many are left with residual neurologic deficits. 2. The pattern of recovery is different for each person. 3. In general, recovery is fastest in the first 6 months after a stroke, with gradual improvement thereafter. 4. The greatest gains in motor function occur in the first few months after a stroke, although improvements in language and cognition may continue for a year or more. 5. The most important factors affecting the extent of recovery are the size and location of the stroke, the age and overall health of the patient, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. 6. In addition to neurologic recovery, stroke patients may have concomitant cardiac recovery. For example, in patients with ischemic stroke who have elevated blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy may regress over time, potentially reducing the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction. 7. The role of rehabilitation in the recovery of function after stroke cannot be overemphasized.",90% of stroke victims recover to a useful level of function within 3 months after a stroke.,"80% of stroke survivors will recover completely within a few months. However, many will be left with some degree of disability.",1. Recovery from paralysis is usually greatest in the first 6 months after a stroke. 2. Recovery continues at a slower pace for 1 to 2 years after the stroke. 3. Some additional recovery may occur after 2 years. 4. The greatest recovery usually occurs in those who are young and are struck by a less severe stroke. 5. The greatest recovery usually occurs in those who are young and are struck by a less severe stroke. 6. The least recovery usually occurs in those who are old and are struck by a severe stroke.,"80% of stroke survivors achieve independent living, 60% achieve full recovery of functional ability, and 80% return to their previous home."

"1. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, ears, and other structures in the body. It is a type of primary ciliary dyskinesia. 2. People with this disorder have problems with breathing and hearing. They also have a greater risk of developing chronic sinus and lung infections. 3. The cause is a gene change that affects the cilia (tiny hairs in the airways and other areas of the body). This change prevents the cilia from moving properly. As a result, the airways and tubes in the body cannot clean themselves. 4. Symptoms include chronic cough, sinus infections, and middle ear infections. 5. There is no cure. Treatment involves managing symptoms. People with this disorder are encouraged to get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza and pneumonia.","1.

"Yes, macular degeneration can cause dizziness.  The macula is the central part of the retina that provides sharp, central vision. Macular degeneration can cause the macula to gradually break down, leading to blurred and distorted vision. This condition is usually only associated with one eye.  Macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 50. It affects about 1.75 million people in the United States.  The cause of macular degeneration is not known. It is usually associated with aging and is rarely seen in people under the age of 50.  Smoking is the main risk factor for developing macular degeneration. Other risk factors include having a family member with macular degeneration, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and being female.  Macular degeneration is diagnosed by a thorough eye exam. The doctor may also order certain tests to help make the diagnosis. There is no known way to prevent macular degeneration. Treatment for macular degeneration is focused on improving vision and preventing further vision loss. This may involve using eyeglasses, wearing a patch over one eye, or using a telescope. The doctor may also recommend medicines or surgery in some cases.","1. No, it does not.2. Yes, it can.3. No, it does not.","Yes.  Macular degeneration can cause a variety of symptoms including dizziness.  The symptoms of macular degeneration are variable and depend upon the location and extent of damage to the macula.  Patients may complain of distorted vision, difficulty reading, or a need for bright light in order to see.  If central vision is lost, patients may complain of dizziness or a sensation of the room spinning.  Patients may also complain of metamorphopsia, a condition in which images appear distorted.  For example, a line may appear wavy or broken.  Patients may also complain of micropsia, a condition in which objects appear smaller than they actually are.  In addition, patients may complain of positive scotoma, an area of diminished vision within the field of a patients normal visual field.  Patients may also complain of flashes or floaters within their visual field.  Floaters are small opacities within the vitreous that cast a shadow onto the retina and appear as spots or cobwebs within the patients visual field.  Patients may also complain of a dark spot in the center of their visual field, called a scotoma.  Patients may also complain of a loss of contrast sensitivity, a decreased ability to distinguish subtle changes in contrast.  Patients may also complain of monocular diplopia, a condition in which a patient sees double when only one eye is covered.  This occurs because the damaged macula is unable to properly fuse the images from both eyes.  Patients may also complain of a decreased ability to see at night or in poor lighting conditions.  This occurs because the damaged macula is unable to properly adapt to changes in lighting conditions.  In addition, patients may complain of a loss of peripheral vision, a condition called peripheral vision loss or tunnel vision.  This occurs because the damaged macula is unable to properly focus the light entering the eye, resulting in decreased peripheral vision.

"1. Periventricular heterotopia is a malformation of the brain that occurs during fetal development. It is characterized by abnormal gray matter surrounding the lateral ventricles. 2. Scoliosis is an abnormal, sideways curvature of the spine. It can be structural or functional. Functional scoliosis is caused by an underlying neuromuscular disease, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. Structural scoliosis can be caused by a failure of normal spine development or by an underlying genetic syndrome. 3. There is no direct correlation between periventricular heterotopia and scoliosis. However, there are several genetic syndromes that have both periventricular heterotopia and scoliosis as features. These include Ape, Ane, and Walker-Warburg Syndromes. 4. There is also a possible correlation between periventricular heterotopia and epilepsy. 5. There is no direct correlation between periventricular heterotopia and mental retardation. However, there are several genetic syndromes that have both periventricular heterotopia and mental retardation as features. These include Ape, Ane, and Walker-Warburg Syndromes. 6.

Periventricular heterotopia is a disorder of neuronal migration that results in malformations of the brain and spinal cord. 2. Periventricular heterotopia has been associated with a variety of other developmental anomalies including spinal abnormalities such as spina bifida, syringomyelia, and scoliosis. 3. In this report, we describe a family with multiple members affected by periventricular heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis. 4. The affected members of this family also demonstrate mild mental retardation and seizures. 5. To date, only one other family with periventricular heterotopia and scoliosis has been reported. 6. This report expands the number of families with this association and demonstrates that the condition is likely genetically based. 7. The genetic locus responsible for this condition has not yet been identified.","1. Periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is a malformation of the brain characterized by disorganization of the cerebral cortex. 2. PVH has been associated with a high incidence of idiopathic scoliosis (IS). 3. The objective of this study was to identify a possible link between PVH and IS through a systematic review of the literature. 4. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1960 and 2016. 5. Only 3 articles were found that reported a possible genetic link between PVH and IS. 6.Further studies are needed to clarify the possible association between PVH and IS.","1. Periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is a malformation of the brain characterized by the presence of heterotopic gray matter lining the lateral ventricles. 2. The prevalence of PVH is 1/4000 live births. 3. PVH is genetically heterogeneous, and at least three genes (X-linked PVH1, autosomal-dominant PVH2, and autosomal-recessive PVH3) have been mapped. 4. PVH is associated with various neurological manifestations, including mental retardation, epilepsy, and spastic paraplegia. 5. Scoliosis is a common feature of PVH, and it occurs in 25% of patients. 6. The scoliotic curve is usually long and sweeping and often involves the lumbar spine. 7. The scoliosis is believed to be secondary to the underlying cerebral malformation rather than a primary musculoskeletal abnormality. 8. The other common skeletal abnormalities associated with PVH include disproportionate short stature, trigonocephaly, and kyphoscoliosis. 9. The association of PVH with idiopathic scoliosis is likely due to a shared developmental defect rather than a direct cause-effect relationship.",1.

"1. HIV is treated with a combination of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. ARVs are used in combinations because HIV quickly develops resistance to single drug. Combination of 3 or more drugs is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). 2. HAART is recommended for all patients infected with HIV, regardless of CD4 count or symptoms. 3. The goals of HAART are to: 4. Reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to a undetectable level by a PCR test (the test that detects the genetic material of HIV in the blood). 5. Improve immune function by increasing the number of CD4 cells. 6. Reduce the risk of developing AIDS and its complications. 7. HAART does not cure HIV, but it can keep the virus from replicating and progressing to AIDS. 8. HAART can be very effective in slowing the progression of HIV infection and reducing the risk of developing AIDS. 9. HAART is not expected to restore immune function, but it does reduce the risk of developing AIDS-related conditions. 10. HAART is not expected to eliminate the virus from the body. 11. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not infected with HIV. 12. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not likely to follow the treatment plan. 13. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not likely to be able to adhere to the treatment plan because of a lack of resources or other reasons. 14. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not likely to be able to tolerate the side effects of the treatment. 15. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not likely to benefit from the treatment. 16. HAART is not recommended for patients who are not likely to survive the treatment. 17.

HAART is not recommended for patients who","1. Treatment for HIV/AIDS is based on a combination of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. ARVs interfere with the life cycle of HIV, preventing it from replicating in the body. 2. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to a level that is so low that the test can't detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load. 3. If the viral load is not suppressed, the disease may progress and the CD4 count may continue to decrease. 4. If the CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm3, the person is at risk for opportunistic infections. 5. Treatment also helps prevent the spread of HIV to others. 6. People with HIV should be careful to protect their sexual partners or needle-sharing partners. 7. People with HIV should tell their sex partners about their HIV status and always use condoms. 8. People with HIV should not donate blood, organs, tissue, or breast milk. 9. Women with HIV should tell their health care providers about their HIV status, so that steps can be taken to protect the baby from getting infected before or during birth. 10. The recommended treatment for HIV infection is a combination of at least three ARV drugs. 11. The first drug that should be started is the one that interferes with the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (the RT inhibitor). 12. The most commonly used RTIs are lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT), and emtricitabine (FTC). 13. The second drug that should be started is the one that interferes with the viral enzyme protease (the PI). 14. The most commonly used PIs are saquinavir (SQV), indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), amprenavir (APV), and lopinavir (in combination with ritonavir: LPV/r). 15.

HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, needle sharing, blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy. 2. People with HIV/AIDS may have no symptoms or may develop symptoms similar to other illnesses, such as the flu. Some people develop AIDS, which is the final stage of infection. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. 3. HIV/AIDS treatment involves taking antiretroviral medications, which slow the spread of HIV and help to control the infection. These medications also reduce the risk of developing AIDS. 4. People with HIV/AIDS should see a health care provider who specializes in treating the disease. They should also get regular checkups and blood tests to keep track of the virus. 5. HIV/AIDS treatment is always evolving. New medications are being developed, and researchers are testing new combinations of drugs. Scientists are also looking for better ways to help people cope with the side effects of the medications. 6. People with HIV/AIDS who receive care and treatment can live longer, healthier lives. They can have families and live active lives. 7. People with HIV/AIDS should not be discriminated against or treated differently because of their disease.","1) Treatment for HIV/AIDS is very complex. It involves a lot of different medications, and it is very important that patients take their medications correctly and on time. 2) It is also important that patients have access to healthcare and support services, so they can get help managing their medications and dealing with side effects. 3) Patients need to know that HIV/AIDS is not a death sentence.

"1. What is familial Mediterranean fever?  Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a condition that causes episodes of fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. The first episode often occurs in childhood or the teen years. Additional symptoms may include a rash and headache. The episodes may occur together or alone and last from hours to days. 2. What causes familial Mediterranean fever?  FMF is caused by a problem with a specific gene. The gene is called pyrin. It makes a protein called marenostrin. Researchers think that marenostrin may be important in fighting off infections. People with FMF may have a problem with this protein, which may lead to FMF attacks. 3. How is familial Mediterranean fever inherited?  FMF is passed down through families (inherited). It occurs more often in certain ethnic groups, such as Sephardic Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. 4. How is familial Mediterranean fever diagnosed?  FMF is diagnosed based on a person's symptoms. There is no specific test for the condition. But, a genetic test can detect the problem with the pyrin gene. If a person has symptoms, a genetic test can help confirm a diagnosis of FMF. 5. What are the treatments for familial Mediterranean fever?  There is no cure for FMF. But, medicines can help control the symptoms. The medicines include:  - Colchicine  - NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)  - Steroids 6. What are the complications of familial Mediterranean fever?  FMF can lead to amyloidosis (a-my-LO-eye-doh-sis), a serious condition in which a substance called amyloid builds up in body organs. Amyloid buildup can lead to serious problems, such as kidney failure. 7. What resources are available for familial Mediterranean fever?

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes). 2. The first attack generally occurs in childhood or the teens and is heralded by fever and abdominal pain, which may be severe and associated with vomiting and (in 25% of cases) diarrhea. 3. The attack lasts 1-3 days and is followed by a symptom-free interval of weeks to months. 4. Repeated attacks occur at irregular intervals, generally lasting 1-3 days and separated by asymptomatic periods of weeks to months. 5. After 1-2 years of these attacks, amyloidosis may develop as a complication. 6. In rare cases, patients may develop a chronic inflammatory state in which symptoms are not clearly separated into febrile periods. 7. In 1997, the gene for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was identified, and its product was named pyrin (for its relation to fever and its location in the pyriformis muscle). 8. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has been mapped to chromosome 16p13.3.","Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes).

The first attack usually occurs in childhood and is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and pleuritic chest pain. 4. Subsequent attacks are usually separated by intervals of days to weeks, and may be precipitated by physical exertion, emotional stress, or infection. 5. During attacks, patients may have fever, abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, or joint pain. 6. The abdominal pain may be severe and associated with vomiting and leukocytosis. 7. Attacks may be terminated by taking antipyretics or by the administration of prednisone (10-20 mg/day). 8. In a small proportion of patients, attacks are associated with serous cavity effusions (peritoneal, pleural, or articular). 9. Between attacks, patients may be totally asymptomatic or may have mild joint or abdominal pain. 10. In patients who have frequent attacks, there may be persistent mild fever, malaise, and arthralgia. 11. In some patients, joints may be swollen and red (an ""FMF-like"" picture). 12. In a few patients' protracted febrile attacks may be associated with erythema nodosum and/or ahralgia, and in some with severe constitutional symptoms, including weight loss, growth retardation, and amenorrhea. 13.

Several medications have been tried with limited success.","I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with burning mouth syndrome for so long. It's great that you're keeping up with our research, because we're getting closer to understanding the condition and developing new treatments.

One of the most promising new approaches is a drug called alendronate. In a recent study, we gave alendronate to a small group of patients with burning mouth syndrome. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that's commonly used to treat osteoporosis and other bone disorders.

The patients who took alendronate reported significant relief from their symptoms. Alendronate appears to work by reducing inflammation in the tissues of the mouth.

We're now planning larger studies to confirm our initial findings and to explore how alendronate might work best in treating burning mouth syndrome. We're also investigating other drugs that might be effective.

It's hard to say exactly when new treatments like alendronate will become available, but we're hopeful that it won't be long. In the meantime, you can help yourself by avoiding foods and drinks that seem to aggravate your symptoms. Staying hydrated and avoiding spicy or acidic foods may also be helpful."

"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but usually affects the skin, joints, heart, lungs, kidneys and nervous system. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system attacks the cells and tissues of the body. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is a chronic disease that has acute episodes. Another type of lupus is called discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which usually affects only the skin. Neonatal lupus, which occurs in newborns, is caused by the mother's antibodies crossing the placenta. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) usually affects young women. Another type of lupus is called cutaneous lupus, which only affects the skin. Another type of lupus is called drug-induced lupus, which occurs when a person takes medication that causes lupus-like symptoms. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because symptoms vary from person to person. Some common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, feeling tired, and sensitivity to the sun. There is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or even years to make the diagnosis. There is no cure for lupus, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs. It is an autoimmune disease, which means the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. Lupus has many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are joint pain and swelling, muscle pain, fatigue, skin rashes, fever, chest pain, and mouth ulcers. There are many kinds of lupus, and they are hard to classify. The most common type is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). There are also several types of cutaneous lupus that mostly affect the skin. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. Drug-induced lupus occurs when someone is taking medication. There is also an overlap syndrome between SLE and one of the cutaneous lupus types. Lupus is treated with medications, lifestyle changes, and sometimes, surgery. There is no cure for lupus, but people can live a normal life with proper treatment.","Treatment for lupus depends on the symptoms and how severe they are. Most people with lupus can control the symptoms with medicines.  People with mild disease may only need NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or antimalarial drugs.  People with more severe disease may need corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic drugs.  Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines. They control swelling and pain.  Immunosuppressants are drugs that suppress the immune system. They are used to treat severe lupus and reduce the risk of kidney and brain disease.  Biologic drugs are proteins that are made by living cells. They help to suppress the immune system.  Most people with lupus do not need dialysis or a kidney transplant.","1. Medications:

Introduction: The management of the regional node basin in patients with melanoma is controversial. Some clinicians advocate routine lymph node dissection, whereas others prefer observation and reserve block dissection for patients with clinically evident disease. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of observation with that of routine block dissection in patients with clinically evident regional lymph node metastases. Methods: A total of 210 patients with clinically evident regional lymph node metastases were randomly assigned to receive either observation or routine block dissection. Patients in the observation group were examined at least every 3 months. Results: At a median follow-up of 72 months, 10-year overall survival was 42.6% in the observation group and 43.5% in the block dissection group (p=0.93). Conclusion: Observation of the regional lymph node basin is as effective as routine block dissection in the management of patients with clinically evident regional lymph node metastases.

"1. Friedreich ataxia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of muscle strength and coordination (ataxia), weakness in the limbs, speech impairment, loss of sensation and heart problems. 2. The disease is caused by a mutation in the FXN (frataxin) gene, which results in reduced frataxin levels and accumulation of iron in the brain and heart. 3. No specific treatment is available for Friedreich ataxia. However, treatment of heart disease and diabetes is necessary. 4. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder. 5. The only way to prevent Friedreich ataxia is through genetic counseling. 6. Friedreich ataxia does not have any known cure.","1. Friedreich ataxia is a rare, degenerative, inherited disease that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the nerves. 2. The most common form of this disease is called the ""recessive"" type. This type is caused by a mutation in both copies of the FXN gene. 3. The ""dominant"" type is less common. It is caused by a mutation in one copy of the FXN gene. 4. Symptoms usually appear in childhood or adolescence. They include uncoordinated movements, muscle weakness, and problems with speech and swallowing. Patients usually have a loss of sensation in their feet and hands and develop a curved spine and foot deformities. 5. As the disease progresses, the heart and kidneys may be affected. 6. There is currently no cure for Friedreich ataxia. However, medications may help relieve some symptoms. 7. Researchers are working on several treatments for Friedreich ataxia.

It is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that blocks the production of the abnormal protein associated with Friedreich ataxia. 10. The medication is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has not yet been approved for use. 11. If approved, the medication will be available only by prescription.","1. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive gait ataxia, dysarthria, loss of proprioception, areflexia, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus. 2. The disease is caused by an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) on chromosome 9q13. 3. The disease has a variable age of onset (10-25 years), a progressive course, and patients usually die in the fifth decade of life due to cardiac disease or pneumonia. 4. No specific treatment is available for Friedreich ataxia, although antioxidants and vitamins are commonly used. 5. Friedreich ataxia is caused by loss of function of the frataxin protein, which is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. 6. Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia. 7. Gene therapy is targeted at increasing the levels of frataxin protein by delivering a functional gene to the cells of affected patients. 8. The initial clinical trials are in phase I and are evaluating the safety and efficacy of this treatment approach. 9. It is anticipated that the trials will take several years to complete. 10. Other potential treatment strategies for Friedreich ataxia include: (1) the development of small molecules that can increase frataxin levels; (2) the development of antisense oligonucleotides to allow the correction of the GAA repeat expansion; and (3) the development of neural stem cells as a means of providing a constant source of frataxin. 11. Friedreich ataxia is a progressive disease, and current treatment efforts are focused on slowing the progression of the disease rather than reversing the disease. 12. Friedreich ataxia is a terminal disease, and end-of-life issues should be discussed with patients and families.","1. The symptoms of Friedreich ataxia usually begin in childhood or adolescence. The first symptom is usually clumsy movement or unsteady gait. Other early symptoms include muscle weakness, loss of reflexes, and impaired sensation. 2. The most common cause of death in people with Friedreich ataxia is heart disease. People with Friedreich ataxia are also at risk for diabetes, kidney disease, and lung disease. 3. Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disorder. It is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 9. The gene mutation causes a deficiency of the protein frataxin. Researchers are not sure how the deficiency of this protein causes the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia. 4. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the symptoms and complications of the disorder. Physical therapy may help improve balance and coordination. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery. Speech therapy may help improve speech. 5. Friedreich ataxia cannot be prevented.

However, it is not clear whether there is a specific gene or set of genes responsible for the increased risk of lung cancer in your family.  A genetic counselor could help you and your husband determine whether testing is appropriate for you and your children.  The counselor could also discuss the implications of the testing, including the possibility of finding out about a gene that increases the risk of cancer but does not show symptoms until adulthood.","1. Yes, testing your mother-in-law and comparing her results with those of your husband and his sisters can help identify if the cancer is hereditary. 2. Hereditary lung cancer is usually caused by a mutation in the EGFR gene. 3. The EGFR gene makes a protein that is involved in cell growth. 4. A mutation in this gene can cause the protein to be overactive, which can lead to cancer. 5. To find out if your mother-in-law has a mutation in the EGFR gene, a blood sample or buccal swab can be taken and sent to a genetic testing laboratory. 6. The results will show if she has a mutation in the EGFR gene. 7. If she does have a mutation, you can discuss the implications with your doctor. 8. If she does not have a mutation, then the cancer is not hereditary.","It is possible that there is a genetic component to your husband's family history of lung cancer.  However, it is important to understand that most cases of lung cancer occur in people who have never smoked, and there are many different types of lung cancer, some of which are more strongly associated with smoking and some of which are not.  Testing your husband and his sisters would allow you to know whether they carry a mutation that increases their risk of developing lung cancer, but it is not clear whether this information would be helpful in reducing your concern about his risk.  It may be helpful to speak with a genetic counselor to better understand the implications of testing for a genetic mutation associated with lung cancer.","1. Yes, it is possible to detect inherited lung cancer.2. The genetic test is called a mutation panel.3. The test will look for specific mutations in the genes that are known to cause inherited lung cancer.4.

"1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a treatment modality that delivers 100% oxygen at pressures two to three times greater than normal atmospheric pressure. 2. HBO therapy is a well-established treatment for decompression sickness (DCS), air embolism, and carbon monoxide poisoning. 3. The use of HBO in other conditions such as osteoradionecrosis, peripheral vascular disease, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, and diabetic leg ulcers is also well accepted. 4. More controversial are the uses of HBO in conditions such as radiation-induced tissue damage, non-healing wounds, and osteomyelitis, and as an adjunct in the treatment of malignant tumors. 5. HBO has been used to treat patients with various types of intractable or refractory menier's disease since the 1960s.","1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a treatment in which a patient breathes 100 percent oxygen at a pressure two to three times greater than normal atmospheric pressure. 2. The increased pressure allows more oxygen to be dissolved in the blood. This oxygen is then carried to areas of the body that may have low oxygen levels due to disease or injury. 3. HBO therapy can also mean breathing oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure, but at a pressure greater than that of normal air (ambient pressure). 4. Hyperbaric oxygen is used to treat a number of medical conditions, including: • Carbon monoxide poisoning • Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) • Gas embolism (air bubbles in the blood) • Healing problems caused by radiation therapy • Necrotizing fasciitis (a rare, serious infection of the skin and soft tissue) • Osteoradionecrosis (bone and tissue necrosis that may follow radiation therapy) • Skin grafts and flaps that have lost their blood supply • Thermal burns 5. Some people with Meniere's disease (a disorder of the inner ear) may benefit from HBO therapy. 6. HBO therapy is also being studied in the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, Alzheimer's disease, aphasia (a language disorder), and autism. 7. HBO therapy may be given in a hospital or as an outpatient. Therapy takes place in a special chamber, which is usually transparent, so the patient can watch television, read, or sleep during the treatment. 8. The treatment lasts for one hour, and the pressure in the chamber is gradually lowered at the end of the session. 9. Most patients undergo HBO therapy twice a day for a week, and then once a day for another week. The number of treatments needed depends on the condition being treated. 10. HBO therapy is a safe treatment. The most common side effects are ear pain, temporary changes in hearing, and sinus problems.",1. The results of Hyperbaric treatment for Meniere's disease patients were reported in 1972 by Dundas and colleagues. 2. They reported that 15 of 20 patients treated by HBO for idiopathic sudden hearing loss showed improvement. 3. A later study by Dundas and colleagues in 1977 included 40 patients with Meniere's disease. 4. They were treated with 40 to 60 min of HBO at 2.5 atmospheres pressure. 5. They reported that 67% of patients showed improvement. 6. Other studies have also shown positive results for HBO treatment of Meniere's disease. 7. A 1995 study by Corti and colleagues included 20 patients with Meniere's disease. 8. They were treated with 40 min of HBO at 1.5 atmospheres pressure. 9. They reported that 80% of patients showed improvement. 10. A 1998 study by Tirakotai and colleagues included 30 patients with Meniere's disease. 11.

This treatment has been used to treat a number of conditions, including carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation tissue damage, and certain wounds. 3. The use of hyperbaric oxygen for Meniere disease is controversial. Some studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen can help reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo attacks, while others have shown no benefit. 4. The studies that have been done on hyperbaric oxygen for Meniere disease have been small, and no study has compared hyperbaric oxygen to a sham treatment (a fake treatment, in which the patient gets no treatment but thinks they are getting hyperbaric oxygen). 5. More research is needed to determine whether hyperbaric oxygen is truly effective for Meniere disease.","1. No, I don't have any knowledge about the outcomes of Hyperbaric treatment for people with Meniere's disease.",1. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance to a varying degree. 2. Treatment for Meniere's disease is based on the symptoms that are experienced. 3. Medication is often used to reduce the vertigo and nausea that accompany the disease. 4. Some people may need medication for the long-term management of their symptoms. 5. Surgery is usually only considered when medication and lifestyle changes have not helped. 6. Hyperbaric treatment is one of the treatment option for Meniere's disease.
1. Cochlear implants are not recommended for children less than 12 months of age.2. The child should be able to sit still and follow simple instructions.3.

The child should have access to a speech therapist.,"1. Yes, if your child is 12 months or older, he or she is a good candidate for a cochlear implant. 2. The cochlear implant is a small electronic device that is surgically placed under the skin behind the ear. It receives sound from a microphone worn on the ear, which picks up sound from the environment. 3. The cochlear implant sends the sound signal to the brain through an implanted wire. The brain can then process the sound so that your child can hear. 4. A cochlear implant does not restore normal hearing, but it can provide significant improvements in hearing and understanding speech. 5. Your child will need to practice with the cochlear implant for several months to learn how to use the new sound signals sent to the brain.","1. Cochlear implants are designed to bypass the damaged or non-functional inner ear and deliver sound signals directly to the auditory nerve. 2. Cochlear implants are typically recommended for people who have severe to profound hearing loss in both ears and do not respond to hearing aids. 3. Cochlear implants have internal and external components. The internal components include a receiver, electrodes, a transmitting coil, and a decoding chip. The external components include a speech processor, a microphone, and a transmitter coil. 4. Cochlear implants are typically used for people who have severe to profound hearing loss in both ears and do not respond to hearing aids. 5. Cochlear implants are not designed to restore normal hearing. Instead, they provide sound signals that can help you understand speech.","1. Cochlear implants are not for every child with hearing loss. The child should be 12 months or older, and should have some language skills. 2. The child should be healthy enough to undergo general anesthesia. 3. The family should be committed to working with the child after the surgery. 4. The child should be followed by a developmentalist or early intervention specialist while getting therapy from a speech-language pathologist. 5. The child should have a thorough evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) and an audiologist.","1. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted under the skin and provide direct electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve. 2. They are typically recommended for people 1 year of age and older with severe to profound hearing loss. 3. Before getting a cochlear implant, your child will need to have a radiographic study (CT scan) of the inner ear to make sure that the cochlea is normal. 4. Your child will also need to have a hearing evaluation to make sure that the cochlear implant will be helpful. 5. If your child has any medical problems, such as heart disease or a bleeding disorder, these must be under control before the cochlear implant surgery. 6. After surgery, your child will need speech therapy and special instruction to learn how to use the cochlear implant.","1.

The lazy eye (amblyopia) is a vision condition in which one eye is weak or cannot see as well as the other eye. 2. Treatment for amblyopia is based on the age of the patient and the severity of the problem. 3. Amblyopia treatment may include: 4. Patching. Patching the good eye may stimulate the weak eye to develop better vision. This is the most common treatment for amblyopia in children. 5. Occlusion. Occlusion is another way to force the weak eye to work. A patch is placed over the strong eye and lenses or glasses are used to improve the weak eye's focus. 6. Optical devices. Glasses or special lenses that correct the focusing problem of the weak eye are often used. 7. Vision therapy. Vision therapy uses exercises and activities to improve the eye's focusing and coordination. 8. Eye drops or ointments. Atropine eye drops or ointment are sometimes used to reduce the amount of light that passes through the good eye and stimulate the weak eye. 9. Surgery.

"1. The most common cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is a side effect of alcohol itself. Alcohol irritates the lining of the intestines and causes a deficiency of the electrolytes (sodium and potassium) which are required for proper absorption of nutrients from the food and water. This causes diarrhea.2. The other cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the ingredients of the alcoholic beverage. Some ingredients like caffeine, high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, coloring agents, preservatives, etc. can cause diarrhea in sensitive individuals.3. The third cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the effect of the alcohol on the liver. The liver is the organ which produces bile salts which help in digestion of food. When the liver is damaged due to excessive alcohol consumption, it fails to produce adequate amount of bile salts and this causes diarrhea.4. The fourth cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the brain. The brain controls the functioning of the entire body. When alcohol affects the brain, it can cause diarrhea by altering the functioning of the intestines.5. The fifth cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the blood. Alcohol causes the blood vessels to dilate and this reduces the blood flow to the intestines. As a result, the intestines fail to absorb water and electrolytes properly and this causes diarrhea.6. The sixth cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the hormones. Alcohol affects the hormones and this can cause diarrhea.7. The seventh cause of diarrhea after alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the immune system. The immune system protects the body from diseases and infections.

The most common autoimmune diseases associated with uveitis are ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 5. The pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. 6. The innate immune system is involved in the initial inflammatory response, whereas the adaptive immune system is involved in the chronic inflammatory response. 7. The initial innate immune response is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize molecules associated with pathogens, and by antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. 8. The initial inflammatory response is followed by the recruitment of lymphocytes and macrophages, and the chronic inflammatory response is driven by T cells and B cells. 9. The T helper (Th) 1 cell-mediated autoimmune response is associated with the HLA-B27 allele and is the most common form of autoimmune uveitis. 10.

The most common types of EDS are the classical, hypermobility, and vascular types. 6. Symptoms of classical EDS include very fragile skin that is highly elastic and may cause the skin to heal with extensive scarring. 7. Symptoms of hypermobility type EDS include joints that are more flexible than normal and hyperextensible skin. 8. Symptoms of vascular type EDS include thin skin, blood vessels that are easily broken or torn, and a tendency to bleed or bruise easily. 9. Symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta include fractures that occur with little or no trauma, hearing loss, and poor dentition. 10. The location and severity of fractures in osteogenesis imperfecta vary greatly among individuals. 11. People with osteogenesis imperfecta often have blue sclerae (the white part of the eye), joint laxity, poor dentition, and hearing loss. 12.

The symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are similar in that both conditions involve brittle bones. However, the two conditions have different causes and different patterns of inheritance. 2. EDS is caused by abnormalities in the genes that produce collagen, a protein that provides strength and flexibility to connective tissues such as skin, bone, and blood vessels. There are many different types of EDS, each caused by a different defective gene. 3. OI is caused by abnormalities in the gene that produces type 1 collagen, the most abundant protein in the human body. 4. EDS and OI are both rare inherited disorders, but they are unrelated. 5. The symptoms of EDS and OI are different because the two conditions involve different connective tissues. In EDS, the connective tissues of many organs and structures are affected, including the skin, joints, and blood vessels. In OI, only the connective tissues of the skeleton are affected. 6. The symptoms of EDS vary widely from one type to another. The most common symptoms are loose joints and very flexible fingers and toes. People with EDS often have unusually wide joints and unusually flexible skin. Other symptoms may include blood vessel problems, heart valve problems, and problems with the digestive system, spleen, and intestines. 7.

"1. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have published recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 2. The treatment of RA involves a combination of pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and lifestyle modification. 3. The primary goal of pharmacotherapy is to achieve sustained clinical remission while minimizing drug-related toxicity. 4. Methotrexate is the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for most patients with RA. 5. Combination regimens that include methotrexate plus another DMARD (e.g., sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or hydroxychloroquine) are more effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA and in retarding the progression of joint damage than methotrexate alone. 6. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are usually reserved for patients who have not responded to methotrexate. 7. Glucocorticoids should be used on an intermittent basis and at the lowest possible dose, given for the shortest period of time. 8. The ACR and EULAR guidelines recommend that treatment with synthetic (bioengineered) or natural disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of RA has been made. 9. According to the ACR and EULAR guidelines, if a patient with RA has not achieved adequate improvement with an initial DMARD monotherapy regimen, the next step in management should be a combination regimen that includes a DMARD. 10. According to the ACR and EULAR guidelines, if a patient with RA has not achieved adequate improvement with 1 or more DMARD combinations, the next step in management should be treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent, an immunomodulating biological agent, or both. 11. According to the ACR and EULAR guidelines,",1. The introduction of biological therapies has changed the treatment paradigm of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 2. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents are the most commonly prescribed biological therapies for RA. 3. Adalimumab and ceolizumab are the newest anti-TNF agents. 4. Etanercept and infliximab are the most commonly prescribed anti-TNF agents. 5. Combination therapy of methotrexate and an anti-TNF agent is the most commonly recommended initial treatment for patients with RA. 6. The addition of methotrexate to an anti-TNF agent decreases the anti-TNF agent dose and minimizes the development of antibodies to the anti-TNF agent. 7. The addition of methotrexate to an anti-TNF agent also decreases the risk of developing bacterial infections. 8. The addition of methotrexate to an anti-TNF agent decreases the risk of developing lymphomas. 9. The addition of methotrexate to an anti-TNF agent decreases the risk of developing solid tumours. 10. The addition of methotrexate to an anti-TNF agent decreases the risk of developing opportunistic infections.,"1. The goals of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis are to help relieve pain, reduce swelling, slow down the disease process, and help you maintain your quality of life. 2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. 3. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help slow the disease process. 4. Biologic drugs can also help reduce inflammation and slow the disease process. 5. Lifestyle changes can also help manage symptoms. These changes include exercise, weight control, and avoiding certain foods that can trigger symptoms. 6. Surgery may be an option in some cases.

Epidemiology: RA affects between 1 and 2 million Americans. It occurs three times more often in women than in men, with the highest incidence between the ages of 35 and 50. 3. Pathophysiology: The etiology of RA is unknown. Current theories suggest a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 4. Clinical Features: The clinical features of RA are highly variable. The disease is characterized by a persistent inflammatory synovitis of peripheral joints. The most common presenting symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the involved joints. 5. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of RA is based on the clinical criteria set forth by the American Rheumatism Association. 6. Treatment: The treatment of RA is challenging. The goals of current therapy are to (1) prevent joint damage and deformity, (2) reduce pain and other symptoms, and (3) maintain the patient's ability to function normally in society. A treatment algorithm is presented. 7. Prognosis: The outcome of RA is highly variable. The disease may be self-limited or may result in progressive joint destruction and disability. 8. Summary: RA is a chronic disease that frequently results in joint deformity and disability. Early, aggressive treatment may improve the disease's outcome.","1. The goal of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is to control symptoms and prevent joint damage. 2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. 3.

"1. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare tumors of specialized cells called chromaffin cells, which are found in the adrenal medulla and paraganglia. 2. These tumors usually secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines, which can cause high blood pressure and other symptoms. 3. The tumors can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). 4. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas can occur at any age but are most common in adults. They occur slightly more often in men than in women. 5. These tumors are usually found in the adrenal glands (located above the kidneys) or the paraganglia (located near the adrenal glands). 6. They may also occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart and the bladder. 7. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are usually cured by surgery. 8. If the tumors are malignant, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used in addition to surgery. 9. If the tumors are benign, surgery is almost always successful. 10. Benign tumors may be removed by laparoscopy (a type of surgery in which a small incision is made in the wall of the abdomen and a special instrument is inserted to remove the tumor). 11. The prognosis (chance of recovery) is excellent for benign pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas that have been diagnosed and treated before complications (such as heart attack or stroke) have occurred. 12. The prognosis is poor if the tumors are malignant. The 5-year survival rate (the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after diagnosis) is about 55 percent. 13. People who have had pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas have an increased risk of developing other tumors of the sympathetic nervous system (such as carcinoid tumors or neuroblastomas). They should be checked regularly by their doctors. 14. There is no known way to prevent these tumors.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization can help prevent pheochromocytoma para ganglioma in your future child. 2. Pheochromocytoma para ganglioma is a genetic disease, which means it is caused by a problem with a gene. 3. Genetic diseases are passed down through families. When a person has a genetic disease, he or she has a 50% chance of passing it on with each pregnancy. 4. In vitro fertilization involves the fertilization of egg and sperm outside the body. This means that the egg and sperm never meet. As a result, the disease causing gene from one parent is not passed on to the egg. When the egg and sperm do not meet, the baby can not get the disease. 5. In vitro fertilization is a good option for couples who want to prevent passing on a genetic disease to their child.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization can reduce the risk of passing on pheochromocytoma paraganglioma to your kids. 2. The risk of passing on the condition is reduced because the egg and sperm are not exposed to each other and so do not form an embryo if the genetic condition is present. 3. The embryo is created in the laboratory and can be tested for the genetic condition before being implanted into the uterus. 4. Only embryos without the condition would be implanted into the uterus. 5. This procedure is called preimplantation genetic diagnosis.","1. Yes, it is possible to avoid passing it on to your future offspring by in vitro fertilization. 2. Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma is a genetic disease. 3. It is caused by a defect in a gene called RET. 4. The defective gene causes a tumor to grow in the adrenal glands. 5. The tumor then releases high levels of certain hormones. This causes high blood pressure and other symptoms. 6. In vitro fertilization is a way to avoid passing it on to your future offspring. 7. The defective gene can be detected in the embryo. 8. Only embryos without the defective gene are implanted in the uterus. 9. This prevents the child from getting the disease.","1.

Yes, IVF can help minimize the risk of your children inheriting Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma, considering your girlfriend is a carrier and it only affects her brother and father. 2. IVF involves obtaining eggs from the female and sperm from the male. These are combined in the laboratory to form embryos. 3. The embryos are grown for a few days and then placed into the uterus of the female. 4. The IVF procedure bypasses the risk of the egg and sperm cells having the disease-causing mutation. 5. However, IVF does not eliminate the risk of inheriting the disease completely. 6. The risk of inheriting the disease depends on the specific disease, the mode of inheritance, and the specific genetic mutation involved. 7. For example, if the disease is due to a dominant gene mutation, then there is a 50% chance of inheriting the disease, regardless of the procedure used to obtain the egg and sperm cells. 8. In contrast, if the disease is due to a recessive gene mutation, then the risk of inheriting the disease is dependent on the carrier status of the female and the male. 9. If the female is a carrier and the male is unaffected, then there is a 25% chance (1 in 4) of the child being affected. 10. If the female is a carrier and the male is affected, then there is a 50% chance (1 in 2) of the child being affected. 11. If both the female and male are unaffected, then there is no risk of the child being affected."

If you have mild to moderate hypertension, you may not need treatment.10. Talk to your doctor about whether you need treatment and what level of blood pressure is too high for you.11. To reduce your risk of developing hypertension, avoid factors that increase your risk, including being overweight, having excess body fat around your waist, drinking too much alcohol, and eating a diet that is high in sodium (salt).","1. Yes, I have heard of this phenomenon before. It is called the ""nighttime surge phenomenon"". 2. This phenomenon is not uncommon in patients with resistant hypertension. 3. The surge usually occurs between 10 pm and 8 am. 4. It is thought to be due to the circadian rhythm of the body. 5. It is important to know that this phenomenon is not harmful, but it is important to control the blood pressure during this period. 6. I would recommend that you take your medications earlier in the evening or set an alarm to remind you to take your medications during the night. 7. I would also recommend that you monitor your blood pressure at home to ensure that it remains within normal limits throughout the day and night. 8. If your blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite these measures, I would refer you to a specialist in resistant hypertension for further evaluation.","1.

You may be having a condition called ""white coat hypertension"". This means that your blood pressure is elevated only when you are in a medical setting (like a doctor's office) and not when you are at home. 3. You may be having a condition called ""orthostatic hypertension"". This means that your blood pressure is elevated only when you stand up from a lying or sitting position. 4. You may be having a condition called ""refractory hypertension"". This means that your blood pressure is difficult to control with medications. 5.

The first possibility is that you may be experiencing white coat hypertension. This is a condition where your blood pressure goes up just because you are in a medical setting. To determine if this is the case, you should get your blood pressure checked at home or some other location away from a medical setting. If your blood pressure is normal in these situations, then this is less likely to be the cause of your high blood pressure. 2. The second possibility is that you may be experiencing masked hypertension. This is a condition where your blood pressure is normal when taken in a medical setting, but high at other times. To determine if this is the case, you should have your blood pressure checked multiple times throughout the day and night. If your blood pressure is consistently high at night, then this is more likely the cause of your high blood pressure. 3. The third possibility is that you may have a condition called sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition where your breathing is interrupted during sleep. Although it is not directly related to high blood pressure, sleep apnea can cause blood pressure to rise. If you are experiencing symptoms such as snoring or gasping for breath during sleep, then you should discuss this with your doctor. 4. The final possibility is that you may have a condition called hyperaldosteronism. This is a condition where a hormone called aldosterone is produced in excess. Excess aldosterone can cause high blood pressure. To determine if this is the case, your doctor may want to check a hormone called renin. If your renin levels are high, then this may indicate hyperaldosteronism and your doctor may want to investigate further.",1) Check your medications. Some medications can cause nighttime hypertension. 2) Check your sleeping habits. Sleeping habits can affect blood pressure. 3) Check your salt intake. Too much salt can cause high blood pressure. 4) Check your weight. Being overweight can cause high blood pressure. 5) Check your kidneys. Kidney problems can cause high blood pressure. 6) Check your thyroid. An underactive thyroid can cause high blood pressure.

"Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  NIH: National Eye Institute","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. 2. Open-angle glaucoma is a slowly progressive condition that often develops without noticeable symptoms. Without treatment, people with open-angle glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. 3. Another type of glaucoma is narrow-angle glaucoma. It is an eye emergency. This highly contagious disease produces eye pain, sudden vision loss, and blurred vision. It is much less common than open-angle glaucoma. 4. NIH: National Eye Institute 5. The inside of the eye is a clear jelly-like fluid called the aqueous humor. A clear, round, clear window in the eye called the cornea lets light into the eye. The light then passes through a lens and then hits the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains cells that detect light and color. It sends the information to the brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is made of many nerve fibers. The fibers from the right eye go to the right side of the brain. The fibers from the left eye go to the left side of the brain. 6. Glaucoma damages the optic nerve. The nerve fibers are like a garden hose. When the hose is kinked or blocked, the water (fluid) cannot flow through it. When the optic nerve is damaged, the amount of light that reaches the retina decreases. The optic nerve sends the light information to the brain through the optic nerve. When the optic nerve is damaged, vision loss occurs. 7. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower the pressure inside the eye. Usually, the pressure can be lowered by using eyedrops, pills, or surgery. The treatment plan is customized for each patient. 8. There is no","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness.

"1. Arachnoiditis is a condition that results from inflammation of the arachnoid membrane, which is one of the three membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid membrane is located between the pia mater and the dura mater. 2. The arachnoid membrane is very thin and consists of several layers of cells. This membrane is very delicate and does not have a lot of room to expand, which makes it difficult for fluid to build up between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. 3. Inflammation of the arachnoid membrane can result from an infection, trauma, or surgery. The inflammation causes the membrane to become more rigid and causes scarring of the tissue. This can cause the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow more slowly through the membrane, which can result in a buildup of CSF in the subarachnoid space. 4. The buildup of CSF can put pressure on the surrounding nerves and tissues, which can cause a variety of symptoms. These symptoms can include headaches, neck pain, back pain, and problems with vision, hearing, or balance. 5. Treatment for arachnoiditis depends on the cause and the severity of the symptoms. It may include medications to reduce inflammation, physical therapy, or surgery.","1. Arachnoiditis is a challenging condition to treat. 2. The treatment of arachnoiditis involves a multidisciplinary approach. 3. Treatment options include medication, physical therapy, and surgery. 4.

The most common cause of atelectasis is mucus (the thick, sticky fluid that covers and protects the air passages) that blocks the smaller airways. 4. Atelectasis can be caused by diseases that decrease the amount of surfactant (a substance that helps the lungs inflate and deflate) or diseases that increase the amount of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. 5. Atelectasis can also be caused by a condition called phrenic nerve paralysis, in which the nerve that controls the muscles that help the lungs inflate and deflate is damaged. 6.

"1. What is Russell-Silver syndrome? Russell-Silver syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by slow growth before and after birth. Babies with this condition have a low birth weight and often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may also have a small head and body and a small, triangular face. 2. What causes Russell-Silver syndrome? Russell-Silver syndrome is caused by a genetic change or mutation. The mutation is in a gene called CDKN1C. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the timing of the cell cycle, the process by which a cell grows and divides into two cells. Researchers think that the mutation in the CDKN1C gene may cause cells to grow and divide at a different rate than normal, which can affect growth. 3. Who is at risk for Russell-Silver syndrome? Russell-Silver syndrome is a genetic condition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Russell-Silver syndrome is caused by a mutation in the CDKN1C gene. The condition occurs when a mutation is inherited from one affected parent. When a child has one affected parent, there is a 50% chance of passing on the condition. When both parents are affected, there is a 75% chance of passing on the condition to each child. 4. How is Russell-Silver syndrome diagnosed? Russell-Silver syndrome is diagnosed based on the symptoms a child is experiencing. A physical exam and medical history will help a doctor make a diagnosis. Genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis. 5. What are the symptoms of Russell-Silver syndrome? Babies with Russell-Silver syndrome have slow growth before and after birth. They may also have a small head and body and a small, triangular face. Other symptoms can include the following: 1. Low birth weight 2. Failure to thrive 3. Small jaw (micrognathia) 4.

"Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a very rare genetic disorder.  There are only a few hundred cases reported worldwide.  The gene responsible for this disorder is MCPH2, which is located on chromosome 19.  The condition is characterized by a small head and underdeveloped brain.  Children with this disorder have severe developmental delay, seizures, and vision and hearing problems.  Most children with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly do not live past age 3.","Yes, there are individuals with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly.  The term ""microcephaly"" refers to a condition in which a person's head is significantly smaller than expected.  Primary microcephaly is a genetic condition in which a person's head is small at birth, and does not grow to normal size after birth.  Primary microcephaly is usually caused by one of two genetic changes, and is passed down from parent to child, in an autosomal recessive pattern.  People with primary microcephaly usually have an IQ in the range of 30-70, and may have physical abnormalities, including a small jaw, and hearing and vision problems.",No,"1. Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly: This is a rare genetic disorder in which the brain does not grow properly after birth. It is caused by mutations in the MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CEP152, CENPJ, CEP63, PHC1, or PHC2 gene. These genes are involved in the cell cycle and DNA repair. People with this disorder have a small head and open fontanelle (the soft spots on the top of a baby's head that close after a year or two). They also have developmental delay, speech delay, and mild to severe intellectual disability.","Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inherited reduction in the size of the brain. Individuals with MCPH typically have a head circumference (the distance around the head) that is more than three standard deviations below the mean for their age and gender. In addition, individuals with MCPH often have a characteristic facial appearance, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. MCPH is typically passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal recessive manner.","1. Primary microcephaly is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, and autosomal recessive (AR) forms have been described. 2. The first AR form of primary microcephaly was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3 and was subsequently cloned. 3. To date, six genes (MCPH1, MCPH2, MCPH3, MCPH5, MCPH6, and PHC1) have been associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. 4. The clinical features of patients with AR primary microcephaly vary from case to case, but all share a pattern of severe intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features, and epilepsy. 5. Recently, a new syndrome of AR primary microcephaly, MCPH-X, was identified and is characterized by severe intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and unique facial features including a long and narrow face, a prominent nose with a broad nasal bridge, and a small jaw. 6. Identification of the genetic cause in patients with primary microcephaly allows a more precise recurrence risk counseling and prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies."

"1. Yes, there are tests to detect MRSA even after a long period of time.2. The most common test used is a culture of nasal swab or blood sample.3. This test will detect if there are any bacteria present.4. It will not tell you if the bacteria are alive or dead.5. To find out if the bacteria are alive or dead, you need to do another test called a sensitivity test.6. This test will tell you which antibiotic will kill the bacteria.7. If you take the antibiotic prescribed by your doctor, and the bacteria are still alive, then the bacteria will become resistant to that antibiotic.8. This means that if you have another infection in the future, the antibiotic prescribed may not work.9. So, it is very important to take the antibiotic prescribed by your doctor for the full length of time prescribed, even if you feel better before then.","1. The best way to determine if MRSA bacteria is still present in the system after taking antibiotics for an extended period of time is to get a blood test called a ""complete blood count"" or CBC. 2. The CBC will show if there are still white blood cells in the blood that are fighting an infection. 3. If the CBC shows that there are still white blood cells in the blood that are fighting an infection, then there is still an infection present in the body. 4. The CBC can be repeated as often as every day to monitor the progress of the infection. 5. The CBC can also be used to determine if the antibiotics are working to cure the infection. 6. The CBC will show if the white blood cells are decreasing over time which would indicate that the antibiotics are working to cure the infection. 7. The CBC will also show if the white blood cells are increasing over time which would indicate that the infection is not being cured by the antibiotics. 8. The CBC will also show if there is an increase in the number of white blood cells called ""neutrophils"" which are a specific type of white blood cell that increases during an infection. 9. The CBC will also show if there is an increase in the number of white blood cells called ""bands"" which are another type of white blood cell that increases during an infection. 10.
