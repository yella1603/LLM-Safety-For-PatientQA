"25-to 50-year-old homosexual men, foreign travelers, and immunocompromised persons are at risk for cyclosporiasis.",1. Individuals who have traveled to areas where cyclosporiasis is common. 2. Individuals who have a compromised immune system.,"1. People most susceptible to cyclosporiasis (cyclospora infection) include: a. immunocompromised persons (including persons with HIV infection), b. organ transplant recipients, c. persons with a history of prolonged diarrhea (greater than 1 month in duration), and d. travelers to developing countries.",1. People who travel to countries where Cyclospora is common 2. People who have close contact with an infected person 3. People who have unprotected sex with an infected person 4. People who eat uncooked food from places with outbreaks of Cyclospora,"1. Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) affects all ages and both sexes. However, infection is more common among non-Hispanic white persons than in Hispanics or blacks. 2. Children are less commonly affected than adults. 3. The incubation period for Cyclospora infection is not known with certainty but is probably about 1 week (range: 2 days-8 weeks). 4. Cyclosporiasis is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Between 1991 and 2007, 3,250 cases were reported, with 90% of them occurring in only six states (Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin). 5. In the United States, most cases occur during the late spring and summer months. 6. The sources and modes of transmission of the organism are not known with certainty, but the epidemiologic features of this disease suggest that waterborne transmission, probably through contaminated recreational water, is the most common mechanism of infection.","1. The parasite is distributed worldwide and is endemic in many developing countries. 2. In the United States, Cyclospora infections are not uncommon in the south and southeast, especially in the summer and fall months. 3. Infection is acquired by ingesting the oocysts, which are unencysted and therefore not immediately infectious. Oocysts must undergo a period of maturation (7-10 days) before they become infectious. 4. Cyclosporiasis is a disease of the developed world; infection is acquired by ingesting the oocysts, which are unencysted and therefore not immediately infectious. Oocysts must undergo a period of maturation (7-10 days) before they become infectious."
"1) Stool examination: The diagnosis of Cyclospora infection is made by examination of fresh stool specimens. The oocysts of Cyclospora are brightly autofluorescence when examined with ultraviolet light. Modified acid-fast staining or staining with dilute Lugol's iodine may enhance visualization of the oocysts. Oocysts may also be detected by fluorescence microscopy with ultraviolet illumination after the application of polycarbolene. All of these methods require that the stool be fresh (ideally, examined within 30 minutes of collection). If the initial stool examination does not reveal the organism, a second specimen should be submitted for examination. The parasite may not be shed in the stool in some cases. 2) Microscopy: The organism may be detected in the stool by direct fluorescent antibody (FA) testing. Commercial kits for detecting Cyclospora antigens in stool are available, but are not yet FDA approved. 3) Isospora: Isospora belli, another EIM, may cause diarrhea similar to that due to Cyclospora. The oocysts of Isospora may be detected in stool by modified acid-fast staining. Unlike those of Cyclospora, the oocysts of Isospora are not autofluorescent. Trichomonas: Trichomonas Vaginalis, the causative organism of trichomoniasis, may occasionally be found in stool specimens. The motile trophozoites of T. Vaginalis may be detected in wet mounts or in material collected with a Dacron ""Swab for Trichomonas"" (Spectrum",1) Stool examination: Microscopic examination of stool for Cyclospora oocysts; 2) Stool culture: Cyclospora oocysts may be demonstrated in stool by modified zinc sulfate floatation; 3) Biopsy: Intestinal biopsy may reveal the organism; 4) Serology: ELISA for Cyclospora antibodies.,"1) Laboratory diagnosis: Diagnosis of cyclosporiasis is made by detection of the oocysts in stool or by sampling of the small bowel mucosa by aspiration or biopsy. Oocyst excretion may not be continuous and may be low-level, making diagnosis difficult. Oocysts may be shed in the stool for 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms, but may also be shed for several weeks. Oocyst excretion may be increased by treatment with antibiotics. Oocysts may be shed in the stool as soon as 1-2 days after ingestion of food contaminated with Cyclospora. 2) Stool examination: Cyclospora oocysts are not readily identified in stool examinations. Oocysts are passed in an unsporulated (non-infective) stage. Sporulation in the lumen of the small intestine is necessary for infectivity. Sporulation is unlikely to occur in stool unless it is in contact with feces for a prolonged period. 3) Modified acid-fast staining: Oocysts may be identified in stool by modified acid-fast staining. The sensitivity of this method is not known. 4) Microscopy: Oocysts may be identified in stool by light microscopy. The sensitivity of this method is not known. 5) Microscopic examination of small bowel aspirates or biopsy specimens: The sensitivity of this method is not known. 6) Histopathologic examination of tissue: The sensitivity of this method is not known.","1) Stool examination, 2) Microscopic examination, 3) Nucleic acid amplification test","1) Cyclosporiasis is identified by examining stool samples. A sample of stool is collected and examined under a microscope for the presence of oocysts (spherical structures). 2) Oocysts are not immediately visible in the stool sample. To help the oocysts be seen, the sample is mixed with a diluting solution. The oocysts will then appear as small blue spherical structures. 3) The oocysts of Cyclospora are very similar to the oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. However, the oocysts of Cyclospora are approximately twice the size of Cryptosporidium oocysts (8-10 micrometers in size compared to 4-6 micrometers for Cryptosporidium). 4) In addition, Cyclospora oocysts have a ""double-walled"" appearance, while Cryptosporidium oocysts have a ""single-walled"" appearance. 5) It is also possible to identify Cyclospora by using blood tests to measure the amount of a specific antibody (immunoglobulin) produced by the body in response to the infection.",1) Stool examination: Microscopic examination of stool for Cyclospora oocysts. Oocysts are autofluorescent when viewed with ultraviolet illumination. Modified acid-fast staining also can be used. 2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an immunoassay based on the detection of Cyclospora-specific antibodies in patient serum.

Healthcare facilities should ensure that there is ongoing environmental cleaning and disinfection, including cleaning and disinfection of surfaces likely to be contaminated with Acinetobacter (e.g., equipment, bed rails, bedside tables, frequently touched","1) Strategy 1: Hand Hygiene - The most effective strategy to prevent transmission of Acinetobacter is hand hygiene. Healthcare personnel should perform hand hygiene before and after contact with every patient, and between patient contacts. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water are not readily accessible. 2) Strategy 2: Contact Precautions - Contact precautions are designed to prevent transmission of Acinetobacter by limiting patient-to-patient and healthcare worker-to-patient contact. Patients should be placed in private rooms and known or suspected Acinetobacter colonized or infected patients should be cohorted. Healthcare workers should use contact precautions when working with these patients. 3) Strategy 3: Environmental Cleaning - Environmental cleaning is an important component of Acinetobacter prevention. Healthcare facilities should develop a routine cleaning schedule for frequently touched surfaces, such as bed rails, bedside tables, and doorknobs. Cleaning should occur between patient contacts and at the time of room discharge. Environmental cleaning should be performed using an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with activity against Acinetobacter."

Use of gloves and gowns when in contact with the patient or the environment. 6. Maintenance of the integrity of vascular catheters. 7. Prompt removal of invasive devices when no longer essential. 8. Avoidance of unnecessary antimicrobial prophylaxis.","2006 guidelines from the CDC recommend that healthcare facilities establish a system for early detection of Acinetobacter infections. Isolates should be sent to the lab for species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Infections should be treated with antibiotics effective against the organism, such as ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, or cefepime. Combination therapy with an aminoglycoside may be used to treat serious infections.","1) Perform active surveillance cultures of patients with recent hospital admissions or high-risk patients (e.g., those in ICUs). 2) Perform enhanced cleaning of patient care areas and equipment. 3) Ensure proper disinfection of the water supply. 4) Ensure appropriate isolation of patients with Acinetobacter infection. 5) Perform hand hygiene.","1) The most common treatment for Acinetobacter is the use of antibiotics. 2) However, antibiotic resistance is a major problem in treating Acinetobacter. 3) Therefore, combinations of antibiotics are often used to treat Acinetobacter infections. 4) In addition, strict aseptic technique (such as wearing sterile gloves and using sterile syringes) must be followed when dealing with Acinetobacter.","1) Surveillance: Surveillance cultures are taken from high-risk patients, such as those in intensive care units, and from the environment and equipment. 2) Isolation: Isolation of patients infected with Acinetobacter or who carry the organism is an effective way to prevent transmission. 3) Contact Precautions: Contact precautions limit the spread of Acinetobacter by restricting the use of equipment such as stethoscopes, thermometers, and blood pressure cuffs to one patient. 4) Hand Hygiene: Hand hygiene is the best defense against spread of Acinetobacter. Healthcare workers must wash their hands before and after seeing each patient. 5) Antibiotic Policy: Antibiotic policy is important because overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. 6) Environmental Cleaning: Environmental cleaning is important because Acinetobacter can survive on surfaces for weeks or months. Cleaning and disinfection of equipment and surfaces in patient rooms is essential. 7) Infection Control Rounds: Infection control rounds are an effective way to ensure that infection control measures are being carried out."

History taking and physical examination: A detailed history and physical examination are essential components of the diagnostic process. A history of exposure to individuals with active TB, previous TB, or patterns of exposure consistent with TB (e.g., homelessness, imprisonment, or hospitalization) should be elicited. Symptoms of TB include cough of >2 weeks' duration, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Physical findings may include crackles on pulmonary examination, scoliosis, and lymphadenopathy. 2. Chest radiograph: The chest radiograph is an essential tool in the diagnosis of TB. The classic findings of upper lobe involvement with infiltrates and cavitation are suggestive of TB. However, lower lobe involvement is also possible, and cavitation can occur in the absence of upper lobe infiltrates. 3. Sputum testing: Sputum cultures for M. tuberculosis and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining are the standard diagnostic tools for TB.

"1. A hookworm is one of several types of parasitic intestinal nematodes (roundworms) that look like long, thin spaghetti noodles. The hookworms that infect humans include Ancylostoma duodenale (also known as the Old World hookworm) and Necator americanus (the New World hookworm). 2. Humans acquire hookworm infections by walking barefoot on soil or sand contaminated with human or animal feces. The larvae enter the skin, penetrate the tissues, and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs and the intestines. 3. In the intestines, the larvae mature into adult worms, which can be up to 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) long. The adult worms attach to the intestinal lining and suck blood, causing irritation and inflammation. 4. A person is infected when the hookworm larvae penetrate the skin. The infection can cause anemia (a low red blood cell count) and iron deficiency, which can lead to weakness, pallor, and loss of appetite. It can also cause an inflammatory reaction in the intestines that leads to diarrhea.","1. Yes, hookworm is a type of parasite.

In May of that year, physicians in New Mexico notified the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the deaths of two previously healthy men who had experienced a brief (less than 2 weeks) but severe illness characterized by fever, headache, and myalgia followed by respiratory compromise and encephalopathy. The physicians had noted that the patients had worked in an area where there was heavy rain and subsequent flooding, which might have led to increased rodent populations and hence increased risk of HPS. In August 1993, public health officials in Minnesota notified CDC about the findings of an autopsy of a young woman who had died of an acute, severe, and rapidly fatal illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and pulmonary edema. She, too, was known to have worked in an area with heavy rain and flooding. Laboratory studies of serum and autopsy tissues from these two patients were unable to identify an infectious agent.

"1) Treatment of symptoms: Because there is no specific treatment for CFS, the goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. The following may help relieve symptoms:  a) Rest and activity management  b) Dietary changes  c) Medications  d) Psychotherapy  e) Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) 2) Rest and activity management: Because rest and activity management is the mainstay of CFS treatment, it is important to carefully balance rest and activity over the course of the illness.  a) Rest: Because rest can help relieve symptoms, it is important to carefully balance rest and activity over the course of the illness. However, too much rest can lead to deconditioning, loss of muscle mass, and weakened heart and lung function.  b) Activity: Patients should engage in as much activity as possible within the limits of their energy and symptoms. This helps prevent deconditioning and may reduce symptoms. 3) Dietary changes: There is no specific diet for CFS. However, a healthy, balanced diet is important. Patients should avoid relying on alcohol, caffeine, and refined sugars to relieve symptoms. 4) Medications: There is no specific medication for CFS. The following may help relieve symptoms: a) Antidepressants  b) Antianxiety medications  c) Sleep medications  d) Medications for pain  e) Medications for fibromyalgia  f) Medications for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 5) Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy can help patients cope with the emotional distress caused by CFS. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may help relieve depression and anxiety. Supportive psychotherapy may also help relieve emotional distress. 6) Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): Some CFS patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, there is no evidence that these therapies are effective for treating CFS. Some patients report feeling better after receiving acupuncture, but studies do not show that acupuncture is effective for treating CFS.

Answer: 9. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and other proteins to fight the germs that cause disease.

Answer: 10. Vaccines can create immunity, prevent infection, reduce the severity of disease, and control outbreaks.

Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.","1) Vaccines stimulate the immune system to develop protection against a specific disease. This protection can be very long-lasting. 2) Vaccines can prevent the spread of disease-causing organisms from one person to another. This helps to protect people who cannot be vaccinated because of health problems, such as infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. 3) Vaccines can often prevent serious complications from occurring. For example, vaccines against pneumococcal disease and meningococcal disease can prevent serious blood infections and meningitis. 4) Vaccines can reduce the need for antibiotics. This is important because it reduces the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria developing.",1) Vaccines stimulate the production of antibodies and other protective host immune responses. 2) Vaccines may stimulate the development of cell-mediated immunity. 3) Vaccines may interfere with the ability of the pathogen to attach to and infect host cells. 4) Vaccines may induce the development of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that kill infected host cells.,"1. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to develop protection against a specific disease. The vaccine contains a small amount of material from the disease-causing germ or a ""killed"" version of the germ. The germ or its parts are changed so that the body's immune system can recognize the germ as foreign. The immune system then works to destroy the germ.

2. Vaccines can prevent disease by:

a. Creating immunity. The body develops immunity to a specific disease. This means that if the disease germ is encountered later, the body is able to fight it off.
b. Creating a subclinical infection. A very mild infection is created in the body. This causes the body to develop immunity to a specific disease. This means that if the disease germ is encountered later, the body is able to fight it off.
c. Creating antibodies. Vaccines cause the body to make antibodies. Antibodies are special proteins that attack and destroy the disease germ.

3. Vaccines work best when they are given before a person is exposed to a disease. For example, the measles vaccine is most effective when given to a child at 12 to 15 months of age. If the vaccine is given later, the body may not develop enough immunity to protect against the disease.","1. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to develop protection against a specific disease. The vaccine may be a solution containing weakened pieces of the disease-causing germ, or it may be a ""toxoid,"" which is a substance made from the toxic parts of a disease-causing germ. 2. When the vaccine is given, the body's immune system makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help the body fight the disease. If the body later encounters the disease-causing germ, the immune system is ready to attack. The disease-causing germ is defeated before the disease can start. 3. Vaccines work best when they are given before a person is exposed to the disease-causing germ. For example, the measles vaccine is most effective when given to children between 12 and 15 months old.","1. Vaccines are a critical part of our arsenal to prevent potentially deadly diseases. 2. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to develop a defense against the disease. 3. The immune system is a complex system of proteins, cells, and organs that work together to defend against foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. 4. When you get a vaccine, it triggers the development of antibodies and other immune defenses that provide protection against the disease. 5. Antibodies are specialized proteins that your body produces to fight off specific infections caused by bacteria or viruses. 6. When you get a vaccine, it triggers the development of antibodies and other immune defenses that provide protection against the disease. 7. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a schedule for childhood vaccines to ensure that children get the vaccines they need on time. 8.

"1) Laboratory tests:  Serologic tests are the most common method of confirming the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.  The Sabin-Feldman dye test, which measures antibodies to Toxoplasma organisms, is the standard serologic test.  A positive result indicates that the person has been infected with Toxoplasma organisms at some point.  The ISAG (Immunofluorescence Antibody to the Gondi) test is more sensitive than the Sabin-Feldman dye test and is becoming the standard serologic test.  The ISAG test can be used to determine the level of antibodies and can be used to monitor treatment.  The ISAG test also can be used to determine whether a person has been infected with Toxoplasma organisms for the first time (acute infection).  The ISAG test cannot be used to diagnose congenital toxoplasmosis.  A negative result on the ISAG test means that the person has not been infected with Toxoplasma organisms or that the level of antibodies is below the level of detection.  The ISAG test cannot be used to diagnose a person as having chronic toxoplasmosis unless the results of at least 2 tests, taken 4 weeks apart, are positive.  The ISAG test also cannot be used to diagnose a person as having congenital toxoplasmosis. 2) Examination of tissue or fluid:  A sample of tissue or fluid can be examined under a microscope for evidence of Toxoplasma organisms.  This test can be used to diagnose infection in a fetus. 3) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test:  This test can be used to detect Toxoplasma organisms in a sample of amniotic fluid, blood, or other fluids or tissues. 4) Animal inoculation:  In rare cases, a person who may have been exposed to Toxoplasma organisms is inoculated with a small amount of fluid from the site of the possible infection.  The person is then monitored for signs and symptoms of toxoplasmosis.","1) Serologic tests (enzyme immunoassay or immunofluorescence) for IgG antibodies indicate past or recent infection. 2) A positive IgM test result, obtained within the first 2 weeks of infection, indicates acute infection. 3) Highavidity IgG antibodies (florid or spiking titers) indicate recent infection. 4) The Sabin-Feldman dye test, which measures the amount of antibody that prevents the staining of trophozoites by alkaline methylene blue, is a sensitive complement fixation test. 5) The ISAGA (Immunostimulation with Alkaline-Phosphatase-Conjugated Antigen) test is a highly sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures Toxoplasma-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. 6) The ISAGA test can be used to determine the presence of antibodies to Toxoplasma organisms. 7) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect Toxoplasma genes in blood, body fluids, and tissues.",1. Blood tests - A blood test can check for antibodies to the parasite. 2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test - This test checks for genetic material (DNA) of the parasite. 3.

"1. Angiostrongyliasis (also known as Angiostrongylus Infection) has been reported from all continents except Antarctica. It is a zoonosis, the principal reservoir hosts being rats and rodents. The life cycle is simple: adult worms are found in the lumen of the small intestine of infected mollusc intermediate hosts, while infective third-stage larvae are found in the muscles of crustacean intermediate hosts. Humans are infected by ingesting raw infected molluscs or crustaceans. In human hosts, the larvae migrate to the lumen of the small intestine where they mature into adult worms. Clinical disease arises from the inflammatory response to adult worms and migrating larvae in the intestinal wall. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea. In severe cases, there may be tenesmus, vomiting, eosinophilia, malaise and fever. Chronic infection may lead to malabsorption and weight loss. Diagnosis is by detection of eggs or larvae in stool samples. Eggs may be detected by using the Baermann method followed by concentration and washing of samples. Larvae may be detected by submucosal injection of formalin-saline into the small intestine followed by removal and examination of the tissue. Nonspecific abnormalities may occur on radiography of the intestine. Treatment is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Prevention is based on the elimination of human infection with the intermediate hosts.",1.
