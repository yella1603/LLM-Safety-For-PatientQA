"Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that involves abnormal protein deposits (called Lewy bodies) in the brain.  Lewy bodies are found in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, but the brains of people with Lewy body dementia also show other changes that are similar to Alzheimer's disease.  Lewy body dementia is characterized by changes in:  - Mental abilities, including changes in awareness, alertness, and orientation  - Ability to carry out daily activities  - Physical abilities  - Personality and behavior  - Sleep habits  - Some people with Lewy body dementia also have Parkinson's disease, which causes tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with balance and walking.  Lewy body dementia is caused by the accumulation and death of cells in specific areas of the brain.  Lewy body dementia is most often found in people over age 60, but it can occur at any age. Men are affected more often than women. Lewy body dementia is usually not inherited, but researchers are looking into whether the genetic pattern may play a role in some cases.  Lewy body dementia is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.  Lewy body dementia is usually treated with drugs used for Alzheimer's disease, including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Razadyne).  The main drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, levodopa, may make Lewy body dementia worse.  Physical therapy may help reduce muscle stiffness and improve balance and coordination.  People with Lewy body dementia often have trouble sleeping. Avoiding daytime naps and getting regular exercise may help.  Lewy body dementia is most often misdiagnosed as:  - Alzheimer's disease  - Parkinson's disease  - Vascular dementia  - Frontotemporal dementia  - Normal aging  - Stroke  - Recommendations for managing Lewy body dementia include:  - Keeping the environment familiar  - Using a nightlight  - Helping the person move around safely","Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that shares similarities both with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. People with Lewy body dementia experience a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function, as well as changes in perception, attention, and hallucinations. Lewy body dementia is often disabling and is associated with significant distress for patients and their families. Lewy body dementia is currently underrecognized, and there is a need for increased awareness among healthcare professionals and the general public.",1.

"1. Mutations in the BCKDH gene cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of three amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. 2. Mutations in the BCKDH gene prevent the enzyme from working properly. As a result, the body is unable to break down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. When these amino acids cannot be broken down, they can build up in the body and be toxic to the brain, liver, and kidneys. 3. The buildup of leucine, isoleucine, and valine appears to interfere with normal brain development and function. Infants with MSUD often have developmental delays, seizures, and intellectual disability. 4. In addition, high levels of leucine can be toxic to the kidneys and liver. 5. Children with MSUD often have a characteristic odor to their urine (sweaty feet odor) and a sweet taste to their breath (similar to maple syrup). 6. The most common cause of MSUD is a mutation in the BCKDH gene. 7. Mutations in the BCKDH gene can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 8. In most cases, two mutations in the BCKDH gene must be present in order for a person to develop MSUD. 9. A small number of people with MSUD have only one copy of the BCKDH gene mutation. These individuals are considered to have a milder form of the disorder. 10. In rare cases, a person with two copies of the BCKDH gene mutation has a more severe form of the disorder. 11. Before birth, a prenatal test can check for the presence of the BCKDH gene mutation. 12. After birth, a blood test can check for high levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine in the blood. 13. A urine test can also detect high levels of these amino acids in the urine. 14. A","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together to produce a protein complex. This protein complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many types of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. 3. When any of these genes is mutated, the protein complex does not work properly. As a result, the body is unable to break down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. 4. When these amino acids cannot be broken down, they and their byproducts build up in the body. The buildup of these substances in the urine and in the blood gives it a maple syrup-like odor. 5. The buildup of these substances also causes a serious imbalance in the levels of substances in the body, such as branched-chain amino acids, leading to neurological problems, including mental retardation, muscle weakness, and seizures. 6. Maple syrup urine disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 7. There is no cure for maple syrup urine disease, but dietary changes can help prevent some of the symptoms. 8.

A lack of any of these enzymes inhibits the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) which accumulate in the blood and urine. 3. An increase in the ratio of the branched-chain amino acids to the branched-chain keto acids is diagnostic. 4. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 5.

The most common abnormality associated with CDH is a defect in the muscle of the diaphragm, which allows the stomach and intestines to migrate into the chest cavity. 4. In most cases, the cause of the defect is unknown. 5. In some cases, genetic abnormalities have been detected in the affected child and in the parents. 6. The risk of recurrence of CDH in subsequent pregnancies is 2-4%. 7. The severity of the condition depends on the extent of the defect and the amount of abdominal contents that migrate into the chest cavity. 8. In severe cases, the abdominal contents may herniate into the chest cavity soon after birth, while in less severe cases, the defect may not be diagnosed until later in life. 9. CDH is diagnosed prenatally in most cases. 10. The diagnosis is made by ultrasound examination and may be confirmed by an MRI scan. 11. The prognosis depends on the severity of the condition, the age at which the condition is diagnosed, and the presence of other abnormalities. 12.

"1) Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the GI tract. 2) They are typically located in the stomach (60%-70%), small bowel (20%-25%), and colon (5%-10%). 3) The cell of origin is still controversial. 4) They are considered to originate from the interstitial cell of Cajal, an intestinal pacemaker cells. 5) GISTs can occur at any age but are most common between 40 and 70 years of age. 6) Patients may be completely asymptomatic with incidentally found tumors, or they may present with a wide variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and obstruction. 7) The clinical behavior of GISTs is usually benign, but it can become malignant. 8) The malignant potential of a GIST depends on its size and mitotic index. 9) Most GISTs are positive for c-kit (CD117) or CD34. 10) GISTs are generally classified as low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk based on tumor size and mitotic index. 11) Low-risk tumors are <2 cm and have a mitotic index of <10/50 high-power fields (hpf), intermediate-risk tumors are >2 cm but <5 cm and have a mitotic index of 10-50 hpf, and high-risk tumors are >5 cm or have a mitotic index of >50 hpf. 12) The treatment of choice for GISTs is surgical resection. 13) If the tumor is not resectable or if it has metastasized to distant sites, imatinib mesylate (100-200 mg/d) is the treatment of choice. 14) The prognosis of GISTs is dependent on tumor size, mitotic index, and location. 15) Small, low-risk tumors have a low risk of recurrence (<5%) and a 90% 5-year surv","1. The most common symptom of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a feeling of fullness after eating a small amount of food. 2. Other symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. 3. GISTs are usually diagnosed after a medical test called an endoscopy. 4. A biopsy is done during the endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. 5. Surgery is the only way to remove GISTs. 6. A small GIST can be removed by laparoscopy. 7. If the tumor is larger or is in a difficult area to remove, surgery will be done through an open incision in the abdomen. 8. If the tumor is cancerous, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be used after surgery.","1. GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. 2. Because of the risk of bleeding and/or obstruction, GISTs should be considered for surgical resection if feasible. 3. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for GISTs, and the goal of surgery is complete resection of the tumor with adequate margins, as well as removal of the associated lymphatic tissue. 4. Adjuvant therapy with imatinib mesylate is indicated for tumors >10 cm or for tumors <10 cm with high-risk features (ulceration, large mitotic index, high Ki67 index).","1. GISTs are generally slow-growing tumors, and many are benign. 2. Surgery is the only curative treatment for GISTs. 3. The goal of surgery is complete resection with negative margins. 4. If the tumor is located in the stomach, a wedge resection or complete gastrectomy may be performed. 5. If the tumor is located in the small bowel, a segmental resection may be performed. 6. If the tumor is located in the colon, a segmental resection may be performed. 7. If the tumor is located in the rectum, an anterior resection may be performed. 8. If the tumor is located in the esophagus, a transhiatal or transthoracic esophagectomy may be performed. 9. If the tumor is located in the peritoneal cavity, a nonresectable tumor should be treated with the least possible surgical intervention. 10. If the tumor is located in the liver, a wedge resection or a transarterial chemoembolization may be performed.","1) If the gastric tumor is benign, then it can be left alone. 2) If the gastric tumor is malignant, then it should be removed surgically. 3) If the gastric tumor is of an indeterminate nature, then a biopsy should be performed to determine its nature. 4) If the gastric tumor is causing symptoms, such as pain, then it should be removed surgically.","1. Small GISTs (<1 cm) may be managed by observation with serial CT scans every 3-6 months to assess for growth. 2. If the tumor grows more than 1 cm per year, it should be resected. 3. For tumors between 1 and 2 cm, the risks and benefits of resection must be weighed, and observation is probably the best option. 4. For tumors >2 cm, surgical resection is indicated."
"3 copies of the gene that is mutated in SCA3 are present in each cell. People who have SCA3 develop symptoms when the number of copies of the mutated gene in a cell reaches a critical level. The specific symptoms depend on the organ systems most affected by the disease. The age of onset and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.  People with SCA3 usually develop symptoms in adulthood, but some people develop symptoms in childhood.  The first symptoms are usually problems with movement. People with SCA3 often have difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. They may develop tremors or shaking. Some people also develop stiffness in their limbs or trunk. People with SCA3 often develop problems with eye movement. They may have difficulty looking in a certain direction or have other problems with eye movements. People with SCA3 often develop problems speaking or swallowing. They may have slurred speech or difficulty articulating words. Some people with SCA3 also develop cognitive problems. They may have difficulty remembering things or have problems planning and organizing.  People with SCA3 often develop muscle problems. They may have muscle cramps or twitching (fasciculations). Some people also develop muscle weakness or wasting (atrophy). People with SCA3 often develop problems with urination, including urinary frequency, urgency, or incontinence. They may also develop constipation. Some people with SCA3 develop heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or slow heart rate (bradycardia). They may also develop high blood pressure (hypertension).  People with SCA3 often develop sleep disturbances, such as insomnia or restlessness. They may also have abnormalities in their sleep patterns, such as a tendency to fall asleep during the day (hypersomnia) or difficulty staying awake while driving or working (excessive daytime sleepiness).  Some people with SCA3 develop skin changes, such as a rash or thinning of the skin (atrophy). They may also develop acanthosis nigricans, dark, thickened patches of skin on the armpits, neck, or groin.","Yes, MedlinePlus can provide you with resources on Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

In some cases, genetic conditions or certain medications may increase the risk of a child being born with a congenital heart defect. 5. Some congenital heart defects, such as atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent foramen ovale (PFO), are known as ""atrial and ventricular septal defects."" 6. These defects are often grouped together because they are often caused by the same types of problems and they may have similar symptoms and complications. 7. Other congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and transposition of the great arteries (TGA), are very different from each other and from ASD, VSD, and PFO. 8. These defects are also often grouped together because they are often caused by different problems and require different treatments. 9. The heart has three layers of tissue. 10. The inner layer is called the endocardium. The middle layer is called the myocardium. The outer layer is called the epicardium. 11. The endocardial cushion is an area of specialized tissue within the heart that helps to control the flow of blood between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. 12. If the endocardial cushion is not formed properly, the septa (walls) between the heart chambers may not develop properly. 13.

"1. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder which means that two copies of the gene in each cell must be altered for this to develop. 2. The disease is caused by a triple repeat expansion in the FXN (frataxin) gene. 3. The frataxin protein is necessary for normal function of the nervous system and for good muscle control. 4. People with Friedreich ataxia have a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene. 5. The disease is progressive and leads to difficulty with walking, balance, and speech. 6. Eventually, the heart and kidneys are affected. 7. The average age of death for men with Friedreich ataxia is 40 years, while for women it is 46 years. 8. The first symptom is usually clumsy movement and frequent falling. 9. Other symptoms include slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, and loss of sensation. 10. The heart is affected in almost all people with Friedreich ataxia. 11. The heart is enlarged in most cases and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) are common. 12. Affected individuals are also at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and scoliosis. 13. Friedreich ataxia is diagnosed through a combination of clinical examination and genetic testing. 14. Genetic testing can be performed even before the symptoms begin. 15. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia. 16. Treatment is aimed at the symptoms and includes physical therapy, speech therapy, and use of medications to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and seizures. 17. Research has identified several potential treatment strategies, including gene replacement, to treat the underlying disease process. 18.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive problems with movement, balance, and speech. 2. Symptoms usually appear in childhood and get worse over time. 3. The most common symptoms are: - Muscle weakness in the arms and legs. - Loss of feeling or numbness in the arms and legs. - Problems with balance and walking. - Speech problems. 4. Other symptoms may include: - Diabetes. - Eye problems, such as weakness of the eye muscles or cataracts. - Heart disease. - Hearing loss. - Kidney problems. 5. Friedreich ataxia is caused by a problem with a gene called frataxin. The gene is on chromosome 9. The disease is most often inherited from a person's parents. 6. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical exam, and special tests. These tests include: - A brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). - Nerve conduction tests. - Eye movement tests. - Measurements of the proteins made by the frataxin gene. 7. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the symptoms. It includes: - Physical therapy. - Speech therapy. - Treatment of heart disease or diabetes. - Surgery for foot deformities or scoliosis. 8. People with Friedreich ataxia usually need wheelchairs at about age 40. Life span is decreased.","1. Friedreich ataxia is a rare, inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive problems with movement. 2. The condition is caused by a mutation in a gene called the frataxin gene. The frataxin gene makes a protein that is needed to make a substance called mitochondrial DNA. 3. The condition is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by a defect in a gene called the frataxin gene. This gene makes a protein that is needed to make a substance called mitochondrial DNA. 4. Friedreich ataxia most often begins in childhood or in the early adult years. It causes progressive problems with movement. These problems usually begin with the feet and hands. 5. The most common first symptom is difficulty with balance and walking. Other early symptoms include shaking of the hands, trouble speaking, and swallowing problems. 6. As the disease gets worse, it causes muscle weakness, which can lead to foot drop and trouble lifting objects. It also causes problems with sensation, which can lead to chronic pain. 7. As the disease gets worse, it causes problems with the heart and other organs. It can lead to heart problems, diabetes, and problems with the teeth and vision. 8. Friedreich ataxia can be diagnosed with genetic testing. The test checks for the presence of the frataxin gene mutation. 9. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the symptoms. Physical therapy may help with balance and movement problems. Orthopedic problems, such as foot problems, may be treated with braces or surgery. Speech therapy may help with speech problems. Eating and swallowing problems may be treated with special diets and feeding techniques. Medicines may help some symptoms, such as pain and heart problems. 10. People with Friedreich ataxia usually need to see many doctors, including a neurologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, and dentist.","Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive problems with balance and coordination.

"1. Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 2. Leber congenital amaurosis is a group of rare, inherited disorders that primarily affect the eyes. 3. It is caused by problems with a gene called RPE65, which is responsible for making a protein called retinoid receptor accessory protein (RAP). This protein plays an important role in the function of the retina. 4. The condition is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. The first signs of the condition are poor vision and a lack of response to light. 5. As the condition progresses, a child may develop nystagmus (a constant, involuntary eye movement) and strabismus (a lazy eye). 6. Affected children may also have what appear to be white spots in their field of vision. 7. The condition is very rare and affects both males and females.","Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.  Leber congenital amaurosis is a genetic disorder that is usually inherited from a person's parents. It is caused by mutations in the RPE65, LRAT, or CRB1 genes, and it affects vision because the retina does not properly develop.  The symptoms of Leber congenital amaurosis are usually apparent at birth or in the first few months of life. These include poor vision in dim light, which may improve when the light is bright, and a loss of peripheral (side) vision. The pupils do not react normally to light, and they may appear to be small, large, or irregularly shaped. Nystagmus, which is a rhythmic, involuntary eye movement, is also common.  In addition to visual impairment, people with this disorder may have other health problems such as cataracts, glaucoma, and seizures. They may also have mental retardation and psychiatric symptoms.  The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. There is no specific medical or surgical treatment for Leber congenital amaurosis. However, people with this disorder should receive regular eye exams to monitor their vision and check for cataracts and glaucoma. Low-vision aids, such as special glasses and large print books, may help improve daily activities.","1.

Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in any one of more than 10 genes that carry the instructions for making proteins that are needed to make and maintain cells in the retina. 3. The most common symptom of Leber congenital amaurosis is poor vision beginning in infancy. Other symptoms include an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). 4. There is no cure for Leber congenital amaurosis, but there are treatments that may improve vision. These include corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses), low vision aids (magnifiers and telescopes), and surgery.","1. Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 2. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells, which convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. 3. Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by problems with the retina, specifically with the photoreceptor cells. 4. People with this condition have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. 5. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. 6. Other features of this condition include: Narrowing of the angle of the eye openings (narrow angle) Narrowing of the pupils (constricted pupils) Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Abnormalities of the eye's pupil and iris (iridocyclitis) Abnormalities of the shape or location of the eye's pupil (oculodigital sign) 7. There is no specific treatment for Leber congenital amaurosis. However, some children benefit from visual aids, such as a pair of sunglasses to cut down on light sensitivity. 8. People with this condition should receive regular eye exams to monitor for cataracts and to check for changes in the retina. 9.

It is one of the most common causes of visual impairment in infants and children. 3. LCA is a genetic disorder that results in the progressive degeneration of the rod and cone cells in the retina. 4. The rods and cones are the light-sensitive cells that line the retina and transmit visual information to the brain. 5. The loss of these cells causes a severe reduction in vision that is present at birth. 6. Vision loss is usually bilateral (in both eyes) and is rarely improves with time. 7. Affected individuals typically have vision that is better in dim light than in bright light. 8. The pupils do not react to light (known as ""night blindness""). 9. Other common features of LCA include unusual eye movements (nystagmus), light sensitivity, and the appearance of a ""red"" pupil (a condition known as ""Heterochromia""). 10. The visual impairment can be mild to severe, and the degree of vision loss often varies between the two eyes. 11. In addition to vision impairment, people with LCA may have associated neurological abnormalities, including mental retardation, developmental delay, and seizures. 12. LCA is caused by a mutation or deletion of the RPE65 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the function of the retina. 13. The severity of the condition depends on the specific mutation or deletion involved. 14. There is no cure for LCA. Treatment may include visual aids (such as eyeglasses and/or braille), and physical therapy may be helpful. 15. The prognosis for this condition is variable. Many affected individuals have severe vision impairment that does not improve with treatment."

People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-1 collagen.  People with OI are born with brittle bones that fracture easily.  They may have other deformities of the bones, such as bowing of the legs or curvature of the spine.  People with OI are also prone to develop hearing loss and vision problems.  OI is a group of genetic disorders.  There are several subtypes, determined by which genes are affected and in what way.  Most people with OI have type IV, also called brittle bone disease.  Type IV OI is usually not life-threatening, but it can be severely disabling.  People with type IV OI are usually of average intelligence.  Some people with mild forms of OI may never fracture and may have almost normal lives.  People with more severe forms may have frequent fractures and short stature and need many surgeries and other treatments.  A person with OI may have one of several types of OI, each of which has unique features and complications.  The severity of the disorder depends on which genes are affected and in what way.  Some types of OI can be very mild and cause few problems, while other types can be very severe and cause significant disability.  The most severe types of OI are usually fatal in the womb or soon after birth.  People with mild and moderate types of OI often have normal intelligence.  People with severe OI usually have some degree of mental retardation.  People with OI do not usually have mental illnesses.  People with mild and moderate types of OI are usually of average intelligence.  People with severe OI usually have some degree of mental retardation.

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a condition in which the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not make enough ammonia. Ammonia is a natural substance that helps to increase the amount of bicarbonate (HCO3) in the blood. Bicarbonate is a type of binder that helps to neutralize the acid in the blood. 3. Without enough ammonia, the amount of bicarbonate in the blood decreases. This causes the body to retain too much acid and not enough bicarbonate. 4. Distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by inherited genetic mutations. It can also be caused by autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, and by certain medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 5. Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include: a. Early-morning headaches b. Feeling tired and weak c. Nausea and vomiting d. Feeling dizzy and lightheaded e. Increased thirst and urination f. Muscle aches and cramps g. Fractures without obvious injury h. Low blood levels of calcium and phosphorus i. High blood levels of potassium 6. Diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis is based on a physical exam, blood tests, and urine tests. 7. Treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis includes taking supplements and making changes to the diet. In severe cases, treatment may include dialysis and kidney transplantation.","1.

Symptoms vary from person to person and may include dehydration, weak bones, and kidney stones. 5. In children, the disorder can cause growth problems and bone deformities. 6. Distal renal tubular acidosis is treated with medications and changes in diet.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis can vary from person to person. People with this condition may experience: fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and feelings of loneliness or sadness. 3. The disorder may cause an increase in thirst and urination. People with distal renal tubular acidosis may also have an increased risk of developing kidney stones. 4. Distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by an inherited genetic mutation or an autoimmune disorder. It can also be caused by certain medications, such as topiramate (Topamax), and by long-term use of drugs such as acetazolamide (Diamox). 5. The diagnosis is based on a blood test that measures the bicarbonate level in the blood. Other tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause. 6. Treatment depends on the cause and may include changes in diet or medications. People with distal renal tubular acidosis may need to take potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder of the kidneys that prevents the body from properly processing and excreting acids. 2. The kidneys normally reabsorb, or return to the bloodstream, substances that the body needs, such as glucose, amino acids, and sodium. 3. The kidneys also play a critical role in maintaining acid-base balance by excreting excess hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions. 4. People with dRTA have a defect in the ability of the kidneys to acidify or a reduced ability to retain bicarbonate. 5. The defect causes too much bicarbonate to be lost in the urine and not replaced in the body. 6. This results in a decrease in the level of bicarbonate in the blood (known as hypobicarbonatemia), which causes a state of metabolic acidosis. 7. Metabolic acidosis is a condition in which the body's blood and tissues become too acidic. 8. In people with dRTA, the blood may become too acidic (acidemia) and the patient may experience symptoms such as tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. 9. Other symptoms may include dehydration, muscle pain, and fractures. 10. In severe cases, dRTA can lead to coma. 11. People with dRTA may also experience hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood), which can cause muscle cramps and muscle weakness. 12. dRTA can be inherited or acquired. 13. Inherited forms of dRTA are caused by mutations in genes that encode for proteins that are important for acidification in the kidneys. 14. These proteins include the type 1 (A) and type 2 (B) Na+/H+ antiporters found in the proximal tubule of the kidneys. Mutations in these genes result in impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate and impaired secretion of hydrogen ions. 15. In addition","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The kidneys normally remove excess acid from the blood by filtering it through the glomerulus, reabsorbing the bicarbonate ion, and secreting the hydrogen ions into the urine. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly remove the hydrogen ions from the blood, which remains at abnormally high levels in the blood. 3. There are two types of distal renal tubular acidosis: type 1, also known as gastrointestinal type, and type 2, also known as the renal type. Type 1 is caused by low levels of the hormone gastrin, which is produced in the stomach and small intestine. Low gastrin levels result in low levels of acid being produced in the stomach. Low stomach acid leads to poor absorption of calcium by the small intestine. In order to obtain adequate calcium, the kidneys then reabsorb more calcium from the urine, which leads to the kidneys not properly excreting hydrogen ions. 4. Type 2 distal renal tubular acidosis is caused by low levels of the hormone aldosterone, which is produced in the adrenal glands. Low aldosterone levels result in low levels of potassium being excreted by the kidneys. In order to obtain adequate potassium, the kidneys then reabsorb more potassium from the urine, which leads to the kidneys not properly excreting hydrogen ions. 5. Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include: * Muscle weakness * Fatigue * Weight loss * Short stature * Severe dehydration * Abnormal heart rhythms * Abnormal levels of potassium and/or calcium in the blood 6. Diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis is based on blood and urine tests. Treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. 2. The kidneys normally work to keep the body in a state of acid-base balance. When the kidneys do not function properly, too much acid can build up in the blood. 3. The condition is caused by a problem with the function of the part of the kidney that is located in the lower part of the kidney, called the distal tubule. 4. People with dRTA often do not have any symptoms. However, if symptoms do occur, they may include: 5. feeling tired or weak, 6. having a headache, 7. feeling dizzy or lightheaded, 8. having a loss of appetite, 9. feeling nauseated, 10. having muscle pain or cramping, 11. having muscle weakness, 12. having a rapid or irregular heartbeat, 13. having a feeling of pressure in the chest, 14. having an increased urine output, 15. having an abdominal pain, 16. having constipation, 17. having dry skin or excessive thirst or 18. having an increased sensitivity to high temperatures. 19. The diagnosis is made by measuring the levels of certain substances in the blood and urine. 20. dRTA is treated with medications that can include sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium citrate. 21. People with dRTA should eat a diet that is rich in potassium and low in sodium and acid. 22. The condition often gets worse over time."

The surgeon may use laser surgery, cryotherapy, or a surgical procedure called vitrectomy. 2. In some cases, the retina can be repaired with a laser. The laser beam is aimed at the break in the retina. The laser seals the tear or break, so that fluid will not leak into the eye. 3. If the break is large, the surgeon may have to remove the vitreous gel and repair the tear with a laser or cryotherapy. 4. If the retina has become detached, surgery may be needed. The surgeon will repair the tear or break, and remove any scar tissue that is pulling the retina away from the wall of the eye. 5. After surgery, your eye will be patched.

"1. Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase-A. Without this enzyme, a fatty substance, or lipid, called GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. The accumulation of this fatty substance interferes with normal brain development and causes mental and physical problems. 2. Clubfoot is when the foot turns inward and downward. It's a congenital condition that's present at birth. It occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 births. 3. There is no known way to prevent Tay-Sachs disease. However, genetic testing can detect if you carry the gene for the disease. If both parents carry the gene, there is a 25 percent chance of the child having the disease. 4. Treatment for Tay-Sachs disease is supportive. It includes feeding and nutrition support.  Clubfoot is treated with a series of casts applied to the foot to help straighten it out.","Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Symptoms of scoliosis include: backache, headaches, visual disturbances, pain in the legs, difficulty walking, pain in the rib cage or chest.4. Diagnosis of scoliosis is by physical examination and X-rays.5. Treatment of scoliosis depends on the cause and the magnitude of the curvature. Bracing may be used to prevent further progression of the curvature. Surgery may be used to correct the curvature.","1. Initially, the goal of treatment is to prevent the curve from getting worse. This is done by exercises to stretch tight muscles and a back brace to support your spine. 2. If the curve continues to get worse or is severe, surgery may be needed. Surgery includes fusion of the spine (the joining together of selected bones) to prevent them from moving too much. Surgery may also include the removal of the lamina (the bony structure on the side of the vertebra) to allow the spinal cord to move more freely.","1. Scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine.

"1. Diabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat and is also made in your liver. Your blood carries glucose to all of the cells and tissues in your body, providing them with the energy they need to do their work. In people with diabetes, the level of glucose in the blood becomes too high. This happens because the body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to do its work. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.2. The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream in response to rising levels of glucose after a person eats. Insulin allows the glucose to pass into the cells of the body, where it can be used for energy. In people with type 2 diabetes, the more common type of diabetes, the pancreas usually produces enough insulin, but cells in the body do not respond to it as well as they should.3. In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Insulin is needed to help glucose enter the cells of the body. Without insulin, excess glucose stays in the blood.4. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with the heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. Damage to the small blood vessels that supply blood to the retina can lead to diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to vision loss. High blood glucose, combined with other factors, can lead to heart disease, stroke, and even the need to remove a limb. High blood glucose can also damage the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure. Nerve damage may result in a loss of feeling or numbness in the limbs.","1. The pancreas produces insulin, which is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. In diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body does not respond to insulin properly. As a result, the blood sugar level becomes higher than normal. 2. The urine bladder becomes heavier because the body cannot use the sugar in the blood to use as energy. The sugar stays in the blood and goes to the urine bladder, making it heavier.","1. The brain, stomach, and urine bladder are organs that are known to produce hormones. The hormones produced by these organs can increase blood sugar levels in diabetes patients.

2. The urine bladder can gain more weight than other body parts because it is a reservoir for urine. It can expand to hold more urine when necessary.",1. The pancreas is the organ that contributes to the increase in blood sugar levels in diabetes. 2. The urine bladder becomes disproportionately heavier because the body tries to eliminate the excess sugar through the urine.,"1. The brain, stomach, and urine bladder are three organs that do not require insulin for glucose uptake. 2. The urinary bladder has a unique ability to store large amounts of glucose. 3. The urinary bladder has a unique ability to store large amounts of glucose. This is due to the presence of a special glucose transporter protein called GLUT 4. GLUT 4 is also present in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. 4. The urinary bladder is constantly exposed to large amounts of glucose from the blood. Therefore, the cells of the bladder have developed a unique ability to store large amounts of glucose. This is due to the presence of a special glucose transporter protein called GLUT 4.

"1. What is trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is a condition that affects the body's ability to process trimethylamine, a chemical compound that has a pungent odor. Trimethylamine has been described as smelling like rotting fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. People with trimethylaminuria typically have a defect in an enzyme called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which is responsible for breaking down trimethylamine in the liver. As a result, trimethylamine builds up in the body and is released through the urine and breath, causing the characteristic odor. 2. What causes trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is caused by a defect in the FMO3 gene, which results in a lack of the FMO3 enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down trimethylamine in the liver. As a result, trimethylamine builds up in the body and is released through the urine and breath, causing the characteristic odor. 3. Who is affected by trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is an inherited condition that can affect anyone who inherits a non-working copy of the FMO3 gene, one copy of the gene from each parent. The condition is most common in people of European descent. 4. What are the symptoms of trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is characterized by a strong body odor that smells like rotting fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. The odor is typically present all the time, but it may be worse when a person is under stress, sweating, or after eating certain foods. People with trimethylaminuria may also experience metabolic acidosis, which can cause symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite. 5. How is trimethylaminuria diagnosed? Trimethylaminuria is diagnosed through a combination of a thorough medical history, a physical exam, and laboratory tests. The medical history will include questions about the patient's symptoms, family history, and diet. The physical exam will include a close inspection of the patient's skin and a nose","Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA forum.  TMAU is trimethyl amine, which is produced by bacteria in the mouth.  It is a very strong smelling chemical, and can be smelled even by other people sitting next to the person with TMAU.  The best way to treat this condition is to keep the mouth clean and fresh.  Brushing teeth after every meal, using mouth wash, and cleaning tongue with a tongue scraper is very essential.  Also, avoiding foods which contain a lot of chlorine and sulfur is important.  You can ask your doctor to prescribe a medication called metronidazole, which can kill the bacteria causing TMAU.  Also, you should ask your doctor to prescribe an antibiotic called clindamycin, which can kill the bacteria causing TMAU.  Hope this helps.  Wishing you good health.","1. You should consult with a geneticist/genetic counselor to determine if you have a defect in one of the genes known to cause trimethylaminuria. 2. If you do have a defect in one of these genes, you should also consult with a clinical psychologist to help you cope with the psychological effects of the condition. 3. If you do not have a defect in one of these genes, you should consult with a psychiatrist to determine if you have a psychiatric disorder that is causing the trimethylaminuria.","1. The first line of treatment for trimethylaminuria is usually to try and reduce the amount of trimethylamine that is produced by the gut bacteria. This is done by avoiding foods that contain a lot of choline. These foods include: eggs, nuts, grains, legumes, peanuts, chocolate, and dairy products. 2. In addition, the use of probiotics may also help reduce the amount of trimethylamine produced. 3. If these measures do not work then the next step would be to use a medication called metronidazole. This medication is an antibiotic that can help reduce the amount of trimethylamine producing bacteria in the gut. 4. If none of these measures work then the final option would be to try and reduce the amount of trimethylamine that is produced by the gut bacteria. This is done by trying an antibiotic called neomycin. Neomycin is an antibiotic that can help reduce the amount of trimethylamine producing bacteria in the gut.","1. You are not alone. Many people with this condition feel isolated and depressed because of the odor. But you can take heart from the fact that TMAU is treatable. 2. TMAU is caused by a problem with a gene called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). There are two types of TMAU: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 TMAU is the most common type. It is caused by a problem with the FMO3 gene. This gene makes an enzyme called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3. This enzyme breaks down toxic chemicals in the body. Without the enzyme, these chemicals build up. They are excreted through the urine and give off a strong odor. 3. It is possible to be a carrier of the FMO3 gene mutation and not have symptoms. Carriers do not show the condition but can pass it on to their children. 4. The symptoms of TMAU include: A strong, unpleasant body odor. This odor is often described as musty or fishy. It is usually worse in hot weather. The odor is mainly from the urine, but it can also be from sweat and breath. The odor does not go away with a shower or a bath. It can affect your ability to socialize and can lead to depression. Foul-smelling breath. 5. TMAU is diagnosed by a urine test and blood test. The urine test checks for the presence of a chemical called trimethylamine. The blood test checks for the FMO3 gene mutation. 6. Treatment includes: Diet changes. Avoiding foods high in choline (a type of vitamin) will help lower the levels of trimethylamine in the urine. These foods include: - Vegetables in the Allium family: onions, garlic, leeks, and chives - Vegetables in the Brassica family: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower - Fruits and vegetables from the Dahlia family: daisies, dahlias, and chrysanthemums - Nuts: almonds, cashews, and pe","1. The first line of treatment for trimethylaminuria is to try to reduce the amount of trimethylamine in the body by eating a diet low in choline (a natural substance found in foods such as eggs, peanuts, and sardines). 2. Medications that block the breakdown of trimethylamine in the body (such as trimeprazine) may also be used. 3. If these treatments don't work, you may be referred to a geneticist to see if a genetic cause can be found and treated. 4. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered."

"1. Louis Bar syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene.2. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in regulating the growth and development of many tissues and organs, including the heart and the lungs.3. Mutations in this gene can result in a variety of abnormalities in the heart and lungs, including holes in the heart, and abnormalities in the heart valves.4. Mutations in this gene can also cause facial abnormalities, such as a broad forehead, downslanting palpebral fissures, a short nose, and a small chin.5. In females, mutations in this gene can also cause premature birth and/or failure of the ducts to open (ductal agenesis), which prevents milk from being produced.6. Affected individuals typically have a characteristic facial appearance, congenital heart defects, and/or abnormalities in the lungs.7. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals.8. Some individuals have severe abnormalities of the heart and/or lungs, while others have mild abnormalities.9. The range of symptoms is due to the variability in the way the gene is expressed and the type of mutation present.10. A genetic test can detect mutations in the TBX5 gene.11. In affected individuals, the symptoms of Louis Bar syndrome are caused by a combination of abnormalities in the TBX5 gene and abnormalities in other genes.12. The inheritance of this condition is autosomal dominant.13. If either parent has Louis Bar syndrome, there is a 50% chance of passing it on to each child.14. There is also a 50% chance of passing it on to an affected individual's siblings.15. A genetic test can detect mutations in the TBX5 gene, but it is not possible to predict the severity of the condition based on the results of this test.16. The condition is named after Dr. Louis Bar, who provided the first detailed description of this condition.","1. Yes, other siblings may have milder or more severe symptoms of the disease. 2. The severity of the disease depends on the type of mutation in the X-linked gene responsible for the disease. 3. If you are a carrier of the mutation, you may have mild symptoms of the disease. 4. If you have the disease, you may have severe symptoms of the disease. 5. If you are not a carrier or have a different mutation, you may be unaffected.","1) Louis Bar Syndrome is a genetic disorder, and is caused by a defect in the X chromosome. 2) If you are a carrier of this defect, then yes, you can pass it on to your child. 3) It is possible for you to display symptoms of the condition, but it is not possible to predict how severe your symptoms will be. 4) I would recommend that you consult with a genetic counselor, who can help you determine your risk of being a carrier of this defect, and also discuss options for genetic testing.","1. Yes, your siblings can have varying degrees of symptoms of Louis Bar Syndrome. 2. It is a genetic disorder and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. 3. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of the child being affected. 4. You can undergo genetic testing to determine if you are a carrier.","1. It is very unlikely that you would be affected by the same disease as your brother. 2. The disease is caused by a defect in a single gene, and if you did not inherit that defective gene from your parents, you are safe. 3. If you did inherit the defective gene from your parents, you would have had the disease from birth, and it would have manifested itself by now. 4. There is no reason to suspect that you are at risk for the disease.","1. Yes, your siblings can exhibit a range of symptoms, from mild to severe.2. The severity of symptoms depends on the type of mutation you have inherited.3. If you are a carrier of a recessive LBS gene mutation, then half of your children will be affected, and half will not. If you are a carrier of a dominant LBS gene mutation, then all of your children will be affected.4. If you are a carrier of a dominant LBS gene mutation, then the symptoms can range from mild to severe.5. If you are a carrier of a recessive LBS gene mutation, then the symptoms can range from mild to severe."

"1. The treatment of colon cancer depends on the stage of the disease and whether it has spread outside the colon. 2. Surgery is the main treatment for colon cancer that has not spread. The doctor may remove the part of the colon that contains the tumor, as well as nearby lymph nodes. 3. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the doctor may recommend chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 4. In some cases, the doctor may recommend a procedure called an ostomy. With an ostomy, the patient has an opening (stoma) in the abdomen where the colon and/or small intestine can be attached to a bag outside the body. The bag collects stool or urine, which can be emptied into a toilet or a special bag. 5. The doctor may also recommend that the patient get a vaccine to prevent colon cancer from developing in the remaining part of the colon.","1. Yes, there has been a recent tv commercial about a colon cancer cure that I'm aware of.","1. Colon cancer is a disease in which malignant cells are found in the colon.

1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). The thickened muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. 2) Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. Blood is unable to be pumped out of the heart properly.,"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. 2. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weaker and enlarged. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to the body.","1. The heart has four valves. When the valves do not function properly, the condition is known as valve disease. The heart valves may not function properly due to a birth defect, infection, inflammation, or as a result of aging. 2. The most common valve problem is a leaky (regurgitant) valve. Less commonly, the valve may become narrow (stenotic). 3. The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. When the mitral valve does not close properly, blood flows backwards from the left ventricle into the left atrium. This is known as mitral regurgitation. 4. The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta. When the aortic valve does not close properly, blood flows backwards from the aorta into the left ventricle. This is known as aortic regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. When the tricuspid valve does not close properly, blood flows backwards from the right ventricle into the right atrium. This is known as tricuspid regurgitation. 6. The pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. When the pulmonary valve does not close properly, blood flows backwards from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. This is known as pulmonary regurgitation. 7. Mitral valve prolapse occurs when one or both of the mitral valve leaflets bulge back into the left atrium during the cardiac cycle. This can cause mitral regurgitation. 8. The most common cause of valve disease is a defect in the valve that is present at birth (congenital). 9. Infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves caused by bacteria (more common) or fungi (less common). 10. Valve disease can also be caused by inflammation of the valves (valvulitis). 11. As people age, their valves may become thickened and calcified (valvular calcification). This is a common cause of valve narrowing (stenosis). 12.",1. Heart conditions: Heart conditions are a broad category of disorders affecting the heart. The heart is a muscular organ that receives blood from the veins and ejects it into the arteries. The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body's tissues and removes waste carbon dioxide. Some common heart conditions include:   • Heart disease (CAD) - Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to your heart become narrowed or blocked. This is caused by the buildup of plaque inside the walls of the arteries.  • Heart failure - Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.  • Arrhythmia - An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.  Some types of arrhythmias can be life-threatening.   • Heart valve disease - Heart valve disease is a disorder in which the heart's valves do not function properly.  • Congenital heart defects - A congenital heart defect is a problem that is present at birth. It results from the heart's failure to develop correctly before birth.  • Angina - Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart is not receiving enough oxygen-rich blood.  • Pericarditis - Pericarditis is an inflammation of the sac around the heart.  2. Tests: There are several tests used to diagnose heart conditions. Some of the more common ones are:   • Echocardiogram - An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of your heart. This test can show if your heart is working normally or if there are any abnormalities.  • Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) - An electrocardiogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can show abnormalities in the heart's rhythm or in the heart's electrical conduction system.  • Stress test - A stress test measures the response of your heart to stress. It usually involves walking or jogging on a treadmill while hooked up to an EKG machine.  • Cardiac catheterization - A cardiac catheterization is a procedure used to diagnose,"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. As a result, the heart becomes enlarged and has difficulty emptying itself of blood. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. Complications include heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and sudden death. 2. Long QT syndrome is a group of rare, inherited heart conditions that have a defect in the electrical system of the heart which can cause episodes of fast, chaotic heartbeats (called tachycardia) which may cause fainting and sudden death.","1. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a problem with the structure of the heart that is present at birth. There are many types of CHD. Some are very mild and may never cause symptoms or problems, while others can be life-threatening. 2. Heart conditions in children are common and can be caused by a number of factors. The most common cause of heart conditions in children is congenital heart disease. 3. Symptoms of heart conditions in children may include: - Rapid or irregular heartbeat - Rapid breathing - Bluish skin or lips - Fatigue with physical activity - Frequent respiratory infections - Shortness of breath - Heart failure 4. Diagnosis of heart conditions in children may include: - ECG - Echocardiogram - Cardiac CT scan or MRI - Cardiac catheterization 5. Treatment of heart conditions in children may include: - Medications - Surgery - Cardiac catheterization - Pacemaker or AID device"

"Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 7, which is a condition known as chromosomal duplication. Williams syndrome affects between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 40,000 people. Williams syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning difficulties, a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality with a desire for social contact. Infants with Williams syndrome may have a weak sucking reflex, feeding difficulties, and delayed muscle development. Affected children have a high pitched voice and a hoarse cry. They tend to be friendly and outgoing, but anxious and fearful in new situations. Individuals with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad nasal tip, full cheeks, full lips, a wide mouth, and a small chin. Affected individuals have a long face with a prominent forehead and a sloping head. Additional facial features include a small star-like pattern of skin tags on the face, and a stiff neck due to a shortened collar bone. Some individuals with Williams syndrome have a curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and muscle stiffness (contractures). Joint problems and a decreased ability to feel cold and hot (altered temperature sensation) are also commonly seen. About half of individuals with Williams syndrome have a heart defect. The most common heart defect is a narrowing of the aorta (coarctation of the aorta). Other heart defects include a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart (ventricular septal defect), a leaky valve between the left ventricle and the lungs (mitral valve regurgitation), and a thickened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Kidney problems, including kidney stones, may occur. In older children and adults, a decreased ability to feel cold (hypothyroidism) and a decreased ability to feel hot (hypohidrosis) may occur.

Adults with Williams Syndrome can benefit from vocational training and social support.","Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of a small piece of the long arm of chromosome 7 missing and can result in mild to moderate intellectual disability. Williams Syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births and affects males and females equally.  People with Williams Syndrome have distinctive facial features, a unique personality, and a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in learning.  Infants and young children with Williams Syndrome often have delays in reaching developmental milestones such as sitting, standing, and walking. They also have problems with muscle tone and coordination.  As children with Williams Syndrome grow older, delays in learning and development become more obvious. Children with Williams Syndrome have difficulty with reading, writing, and math. They also have trouble understanding and using language.  In addition to cognitive problems, people with Williams Syndrome often have problems with attention and impulse control. They may be very friendly and trusting, which can make them easy targets for bullies and scams.  People with Williams Syndrome have distinctive facial features, including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad nasal bridge, full cheeks, and a small chin. They also tend to have a long, narrow face, with a prominent, narrow jaw.  Other features of Williams Syndrome can include a star-like pattern in the iris of the eye, a long neck, and a curvature of the spine.  Some people with Williams Syndrome have heart and blood vessel problems, including a condition called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). This is a narrowing of the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.  People with Williams Syndrome also have a high risk of developing diabetes by their late teens or twenties.  A person with Williams Syndrome may have a medical test to check for SVAS, and should get regular blood tests to check for diabetes.  Children with Williams Syndrome should get regular eye exams to check for problems with vision.

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission).  The other type is progressive subtype, which is characterized by a steady functional decline from disease onset.  The etiology of MS remains unknown.  The prevailing hypothesis is that MS results from an autoimmune attack on the central nervous system (CNS), triggered by an infectious or environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals.  The disease is marked by distinct episodes of clinical inflammation, separated in time, with at least 30 days between attacks.  The clinical deficits resulting from an attack may resolve or leave sequelae, such as weakness or numbness, that disappear or worsen over time.  Between attacks, patients may be neurologically normal, or may have residual deficits from previous attacks.  The diagnosis of MS requires evidence of damage to the CNS, based on clinical deficits and/or abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Two objective measures are required to attribute a deficit to MS:  Objective clinical findings (e.g., aphasia, agraphia, or hemianopia) must coincide with an objective measure of damage to the CNS (e.g., an MRI scan showing multiple white matter lesions).  A second objective clinical deficit (e.g., a second visual field defect) in combination with a second objective measure of CNS damage (e.g., a second MRI scan showing additional white matter lesions) is required to attribute a deficit to MS.  In the absence of objective evidence of CNS damage, a diagnosis of MS cannot be made. 10% to 20% of individuals with MS have a first attack as a teenager; in these cases, a history of optic neuritis (ON) or myelitis is often obtained.  The onset of MS can be abrupt or insidious,","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.

The other type is progressive subtype, which is characterized by a steady functional decline from disease onset.  The etiology of MS is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Treatment is based on the course of the disease.  In relapsing-remitting MS, disease-modifying agents reduce the biological activity and frequency of relapses.  In progressive subtype, immunomodulators and immunosuppressants are used to reduce the biological activity.  In both cases, symptomatic treatment is used to manage pain, bladder dysfunction, and spasticity.  Overall, the prognosis of MS is quite variable, and it is difficult to predict the course of the disease in any individual patient.  The disease can be quite disabling in some patients, while others can maintain a relatively normal lifestyle for many years.  Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS, and the disease is fatal in a small percentage of cases.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.

MS patients frequently present with sensory loss, optic neuritis, weakness, and other neurologic deficits. The diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical history and examination in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The mainstay treatment for MS is symptomatic. However, disease-modifying agents (DMAs) that reduce the biological activity of MS are available. These include beta interferons, glatiramer acetate, monoclonal antibodies, and fingolimod. Despite the availability of these agents, there is still a need for better therapies, particularly for patients with progressive forms of MS.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.

"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Lupus is an autoimmune disease which means that your body is producing antibodies that are attacking your own tissues. Lupus can affect almost any organ system in the body. The most commonly affected are the skin, joints, blood vessels, lungs, heart and kidneys. The treatment of lupus depends on the organ systems affected and the severity of those effects. In general, the treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medications, steroids, antimalarials, immunosuppressants, and other medications that modulate the immune system. I would suggest you to consult a Rheumatologist for further evaluation and treatment. Hope this information is helpful. Thanks","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood vessels, and brain. It is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system attacks the tissues and organs. Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are joint pain or swelling, muscle pain, fatigue, fever, chest pain, and mouth ulcers. There are many kinds of lupus, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is the most common type. There is also discoid lupus, which affects only the skin. Subacute cutaneous lupus affects the skin and joints. Another type is neonatal lupus, which affects newborns. People with lupus often feel very tired. They also may have fevers, chills, or other signs of infection. Many of the problems caused by lupus are treatable. But no one medication will help all people with lupus. The choice of medicines depends on the symptoms and the severity of the disease.  People with mild disease may need only acetaminophen to relieve joint pain or fever. For more severe symptoms, doctors may prescribe corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs, or antimalarial medicines. In addition to medications, people with lupus should get enough rest, avoid exposure to the sun, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect different organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain.

The goals of the treatment plan are to:  - Prevent flares  - Treat flares when they occur  - Reduce organ damage and other problems  - Manage the symptoms of lupus  6 types of treatment are used for lupus:  - Medications  - Lifestyle changes  - Physical therapy  - Surgery  - Alternative treatments  - Supportive care","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, and brain. It is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system attacks the tissues and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.   Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. The cause of lupus is not known.  Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are   - Joint pain or swelling  - Muscle pain  - Fever with no known cause   - Fatigue  - Red rashes, often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")  - Chest pain when taking a deep breath  - Feeling very tired  - Hair loss  - Swollen glands  - Mouth ulcers  - Feeling very sensitive to cold or to bright lights  - Pain in the eyes or eyes that become red or swollen  - Stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting  - Swollen legs or hands  - Blood in urine  - Coughing or difficulty breathing  - Seizures  - Pain in the abdomen, especially the lower part    These are just some of the symptoms of lupus. Not everyone with lupus has all these symptoms, and some people with lupus have different symptoms.    Lupus can be hard to diagnose because it has so many symptoms, and some of them are like other diseases. There is no one test for lupus. Doctors usually use several tests. These may include   - Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), a urinalysis, and tests for kidney and liver function  - A test for the rheumatoid factor, although many"

CML is often managed with targeted therapy, which is designed to inhibit the abnormal protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome.

###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.","1. What triggers the development of leukemia cancer?

The exact cause of leukemia is not known. However, there are several risk factors that increase the chance of developing leukemia, including:

- Exposure to high levels of radiation or certain chemicals
- Certain types of chemotherapy drugs
- Certain types of radiation therapy
- Genetic disorders
- Exposure to certain leukemia causing viruses such as the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)

Answer: 2. Can leukemia be overcome?

Yes, leukemia can be overcome. Treatment options for leukemia include chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplantation.

Answer: 3. In what ways does leukemia affect the body?

Leukemia affects the body in several ways. The most common symptoms of leukemia are fatigue, frequent infections, bleeding, and pain or swelling in the bones or joints. Other symptoms include fever, chills, weight loss, and night sweats.

Answer: 4. Is there a genetic link to leukemia?

In some cases, there is a genetic link to leukemia. People with a family history of leukemia may be more likely to develop the disease. In addition, certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia.

Answer: 5. What characterizes advanced leukemia?

Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain or spinal cord. It may also be referred to as acute or chronic leukemia.

Answer: 6. How long can a person with leukemia typically expect to live?

The prognosis for people with leukemia depends on many factors, including the type of leukemia, the patient's age, and whether the leukemia has been treated early. With treatment, some patients may be cured. However, the prognosis for patients with advanced leukemia is generally poor.

Answer: 7. What are the obvious signs of having leukemia?","1. Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood that results in an increased number of white blood cells. There are several types of leukemia, which are classified based on which type of white blood cell is affected and the rate at which these cells are growing and multiplying. 2. Leukemia is a treatable and, in many cases, curable disease. Survival rates depend on many factors, including the type and stage of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, and the treatment options available. 3. Leukemia can affect many parts of the body, but mainly the bone marrow, blood, and lymph nodes. The bone marrow makes the cells that become white blood cells. White blood cells help the body fight infection. They are produced in the bone marrow and then move into the bloodstream to travel around the body. 4. Leukemia is not a hereditary condition. A person with leukemia is not born with the condition. Rather, leukemia develops in the bone marrow and blood, which are part of the body's immune system. 5. Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. 6. Early detection of leukemia is possible for some types of the disease. People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) may have no symptoms at first. However, routine blood tests can detect CLL or ALL before symptoms appear. 7. Early detection and prompt treatment of leukemia offer the best chance for curing the disease. The following tests may be used to detect leukemia: Blood tests - A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number of different types of cells in the blood. A CBC can reveal the presence of too many white blood cells. Bone marrow biopsy - A bone marrow biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of bone and bone marrow is removed, generally from the hip bone, breastbone, or thigh bone. The sample is sent to a laboratory to be viewed under a microscope. The laboratory technician looks for","1. Researchers don't know what causes most cases of leukemia. However, certain factors are known to increase the risk of developing leukemia. These factors include: smoking, exposure to high levels of radiation or certain chemicals, and a family history of blood cancer. 2. Some types of leukemia can be cured. More than 90% of children and 70% of adults with ALL achieve long-term remission (the cancer is gone) with treatment. More than 80% of people diagnosed with CLL live at least 5 years, and many live much longer. A small number of people with AML are cured. The survival rates for other types of leukemia are lower. 3. Leukemia cells can crowd out the healthy blood cells, causing anemia (low red blood cell count), which can make a person feel tired and pale. The disease can also suppress the immune system, which leaves a person susceptible to infections. Leukemia cells can also grow in bones and other organs, causing bone pain and other symptoms. 4. No, leukemia is not passed down through genes. 5. Acute leukemia is leukemia that develops quickly, and chronic leukemia is leukemia that develops slowly. AML is considered acute, and CML is considered chronic. Acute leukemia needs immediate treatment, and chronic leukemia may not need treatment for many years. 6. The prognosis depends on many factors, including the type of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, and whether the leukemia has been treated before. Survival rates are an estimate of how many people with leukemia live at least 5 years. Survival rates are based on people diagnosed with leukemia in the past, and cannot predict how long a specific person will live. However, the 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with leukemia is 67%. 7. There are no visible signs of leukemia. 8. The treatment of leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, and whether the leukemia has been treated before. The goal of treatment is to destroy the leukemia cells and allow the bone marrow to","1. The exact cause of leukemia is not known. However, scientists have identified certain genetic and environmental factors that may play a role in the development of leukemia. These factors include age, family history, exposure to radiation and certain chemicals, and a history of other types of cancer. 2. The prognosis for people with leukemia varies. It is difficult to make general statements about the course of the disease. However, most people with leukemia respond well to treatment. 3. The symptoms of leukemia are caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells and the accumulation of leukemia cells in other organs, such as the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. The symptoms of leukemia are generally related to the location of the leukemic cells. 4. Leukemia is not an inherited trait. However, research has shown that some genetic factors do play a role in the development of some types of leukemia. 5. In the early stages of leukemia, there may be no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally related to the location of the leukemic cells. Leukemia cells may crowd out the healthy blood cells, causing anemia and easy bruising or bleeding. The leukemic cells may also collect in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, causing swelling and pain. The leukemic cells may also infiltrate the lymph nodes, causing ""painless swellings"" of the lymph nodes. 6. The average life span for someone with leukemia depends on the type and extent of the disease. 7. There are certain factors that may indicate the presence of leukemia. These factors include easy bruising and excessive bleeding, painless lumps (swollen lymph nodes), recurrent infections, fatigue, and swelling and pain in the bone or joints. 8. The required treatments for leukemia depend on the type and extent of the disease. Generally, the treatment of leukemia falls into two categories: chemotherapy and biological therapy. 9. The symptoms of leukemia are generally related to the location of the leukemic cells. In the early stages of leukemia"

"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is the most common and most severe form of muscular dystrophy.  The disease is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and include difficulty walking, a waddling gait, and calf muscle weakness. The disease slowly progresses so that a person with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may eventually have difficulty getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, or walking.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Symptoms are caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, which provides instructions for making the dystrophin protein. The mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy most often results from an deletion (removal) of a small section of the DMD gene.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is usually diagnosed before age 6, when symptoms become apparent. Diagnosis may be confirmed by a blood test that measures the level of dystrophin in the blood or by a muscle biopsy.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is managed with a combination of medications and physical therapy. Steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to slow the progression of muscle weakness.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder. There is no known way to prevent the disease.  The prognosis for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is generally poor. Most people with the disease die in their early twenties due to respiratory failure or heart failure.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves progressive muscle weakness. It is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep the muscle fibers intact.  Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. These symptoms include difficulty walking, frequent falls, toe walking, and the inability to get up from a lying position. The symptoms progress until the person is confined to a wheelchair, which usually occurs by age 12.  Support groups, financial assistance, and educational resources are available.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited genetic disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is important for the normal function of muscles.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes. In females who carry the mutated gene, it is usually the second copy of the gene that is mutated. Females who carry the mutated gene are rarely affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually appear before age 5. They include:  - Loss of muscle strength  - Frequent falls  - Trouble getting up from a lying or sitting position  - Walking and running problems  - Leg and calf muscle swelling  - Enlarged belly from breathing muscle weakness  - Problems eating and using utensils  - Learning disabilities  - Delayed speech   Physical exam  - While examining your child, the doctor will note how your child moves and interacts with others.  - The doctor will also check your child's muscle strength and reflexes.  - The doctor will use a device called a dynamometer to measure strength.  - The doctor will also check your child's ability to move the eyes and perform certain tasks.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. It is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. The disease affects roughly 1 in 3300 boys, or about 4000 new cases per year. The disease is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and include difficulty walking, frequent falls, and an inability to keep the back straight. The disease slowly worsens until most victims are unable to walk by age 12. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is typically not diagnosed until age 3 or 4, when the disease has already caused muscle weakness and wasting. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Treatment involves exercise, braces, and wheelchairs.","Yes, absolutely.

If the cancer is completely treated and does not recur, then the person can live as normal person.4. If the cancer recurs, then the person may need further treatment which may affect the life span.5. If the cancer is not treatable, then the person may not survive for more than few months. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",5-year survival rate for colon cancer is 65%. This means that 65 out of 100 people with colon cancer are alive 5 years after being diagnosed. Relapse can occur even after 5 years. Life expectancy depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis.,"1. Yes, it is possible for cancer to return even after all the treatments are finished. 2. The prognosis depends on the type of cancer and the stage of cancer at the time of detection. 3. If detected early, the survival rate is good. 4. If detected late, the survival rate is poor. 5. Survival rate is the number of people living with a specific cancer who are alive at a given time after their diagnosis compared to the number of people who died from the disease. 6. Survival rates are used in cancer research to measure the effectiveness of different treatments. 7. A survival rate of 100% means that everyone who was treated for that cancer survived. 8. A survival rate of 50% means that half of the people who were treated for that cancer survived. 9. A survival rate of 0% means that none of the people who were treated for that cancer survived.",5-year survival rate for cancer of the colon and rectum is 65%. This means that 65 out of 100 people who have this cancer will live at least 5 years after being diagnosed. 25 out of 100 people who have this cancer will die from it. Only 5-year survival rate is available for people who were diagnosed with colon cancer or rectal cancer before 2010.,"1. The risk of recurrence depends on many factors, including the type and stage of the cancer, the extent of the original tumor, the type of treatment given, and the length of time that has elapsed since treatment was completed. 2. People who have had cancer can live for many years without signs of cancer and without risk to themselves or others.","1. Survival rates for people with cancer depend on many factors. Only a doctor familiar with a person's medical history, type of cancer, stage of cancer, characteristics of the tumor, treatment options, response to treatment, and other factors can put all of this information together with survival rates to arrive at a prognosis. 2. A prognosis is the doctor's best estimate of how cancer will affect a person and how it will respond to treatment. A prognosis is not a prediction of whether or not a person has or will develop cancer. Instead, it is a description of the likely course of the disease and includes the possibility of recovery. 3. Prognosis depends on many factors, including the type and stage of the cancer, the extent to which it has spread, and the person's general health. 4. In addition to treatment, prognosis also depends on the patient's age, overall health, and the extent to which the cancer has spread. 5. Prognosis is also affected by certain features of the tumor. If the tumor is very large, for example, it may be more likely to contain cancer cells that have spread into surrounding tissues. 6. Some cancers have a higher risk of recurring (coming back) after treatment. Prognosis also depends on the length of time the cancer is present before it is found and treated. 7. Prognosis is different for each person and cannot be stated exactly in advance. The doctor will give a prognosis based on the patient's condition and the usual course of the disease as seen in similar cases. 8. A prognosis is not always an exact prediction of the future. The prognosis may change if the cancer spreads or responds differently than expected to treatment. 9. Prognosis is one of the many factors a person with cancer and his or her family should consider when deciding on a treatment plan. A person with cancer and his or her family may want to discuss the prognosis with their doctor. The doctor may also be able to provide information about survival rates for the specific cancer and prognostic factors."

The virus is spread through direct contact with blood and body fluids of an infected person. 3. The most common ways HIV is spread are: - Sexual contact with an infected person - Sharing needles or syringes with an infected person - From mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. 4. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS. However, there are medicines that can help people with HIV/AIDS live longer and better lives. 5. If you think you have been exposed to HIV, talk to your doctor right away. You may be able to take medicines that can prevent you from getting HIV or reduce your chances of getting it. 6. If you have HIV and receive regular medical care and take medicine as prescribed, you can live a longer, healthier life. 7. You may need to see your doctor more often to check for problems caused by HIV or its treatment. 8. If you have HIV and are pregnant, getting regular medical care is important for you and your baby. 9. If you have HIV and are taking antiretroviral medicines, you can still get an HIV infection. But it is a lot less likely. 10. If you have HIV and your partner does not, you can still pass HIV to him or her through sex. Always use condoms. 11.

Maraviroc (brand name: Selzentry) 6. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have about medication side effects, and they can work together to find a solution. 7. Finally, it's also important to note that HIV/AIDS treatment is not just about medications. It's also about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and reducing stress.","1. HIV/AIDS treatment options are constantly evolving, and the best treatment plan will depend on your individual needs and medical history. However, some common medications include:

a. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) - This is a combination of medications that work together to suppress the virus.

b. Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) - These drugs interfere with the virus' ability to copy itself.

c. Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NtRTIs) - These drugs work in a similar way to NRTIs.

d. Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) - These drugs also interfere with the virus' ability to copy itself.

e. Protease Inhibitors (PIs) - These drugs block the virus' ability to assemble new proteins.

f. Integrase Inhibitors - These drugs interfere with the virus' ability to integrate itself into human DNA.

g. Entry Inhibitors - These drugs prevent the virus from entering human cells.

h. Fusion Inhibitors - These drugs prevent the virus from merging with human cells.

i. Maraviroc - This drug targets the CCR5 co-receptor on the surface of human immune cells, preventing the virus from entering the cell.

2. The specific medications you receive will depend on a number of factors, including:

a. Your medical history

b. The stage of HIV infection you are in

c. Any other medical conditions you have

d. Your lifestyle

e. The availability of different drugs in your country or region

3. It's important to remember that HIV/AIDS treatment is a lifelong commitment, and you will need to see a healthcare provider regularly to monitor your treatment's effectiveness and adjust your medication as needed.

4. If you're interested in learning more about HIV/AIDS treatment options, I recommend speaking with a healthcare provider who specializes in HIV/AIDS care. They can help you determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.","1. HIV/AIDS is a serious disease, but there are many treatment options available. Treatment can help you live longer and improve your quality of life. 2. The most common treatment for HIV/AIDS is a combination of antiretroviral medicines. These medicines slow the growth of HIV and can reduce the amount of HIV in your blood. 3. Antiretroviral medicines work by interfering with the ability of HIV to make copies of itself. The medicines can keep the virus from replicating, or making more copies of itself. 4. There are several types of antiretroviral medicines. Some interfere with the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is responsible for making a copy of the HIV genetic material. Others interfere with the protease enzyme, which cuts the proteins that are made by the HIV genetic material. 5. A combination of antiretroviral medicines is often used because it is more effective than a single medicine. It also helps to reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. 6. Antiretroviral medicines are usually given in combination as a pill. There are many different combinations of medicines. 7. The choice of medicines is different for each person. It depends on your CD4 count, your viral load, and any other health problems you may have. 8. You should not stop taking your medicines or change the dosage without talking to your health care provider. 9. Antiretroviral medicines can have side effects. Some of the most common side effects are: - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite - Fatigue - Weight loss - Abnormal dreams - Night sweats - Diarrhea - Headache - Mental confusion 10. Some of the newer medicines have fewer side effects. Your provider can tell you which side effects to expect based on the medicines you are taking. 11. Some side effects may go away after you have been taking the medicines for a few weeks. Other side effects may be long-lasting or permanent. 12. Antiretroviral medicines can also interact with other medicines you are taking. This can increase the risk of side effects or make the medicines less effective.","1. HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system and reduces the body's ability to fight infections. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 2. HIV/AIDS treatment is a combination of medicines that can help control the virus and prevent or reduce the risk of developing AIDS. 3. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the name given to the combination of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS. 4. ART can't cure HIV/AIDS, but it can help stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of developing AIDS. 5. HIV/AIDS treatment usually involves taking a combination of at least three different types of antiretroviral drugs. This is because the virus can rapidly develop resistance to single-drug treatment. 6. The choice of drugs depends on the individual's medical history and CD4 count. 7. CD4 count is a measure of the strength of the immune system. It is usually measured as part of an HIV test. 8. If the CD4 count is high, the doctor may recommend waiting before starting treatment. 9. If the CD4 count is low, or if the person has symptoms of HIV/AIDS, treatment should be started as soon as possible. 10. HIV/AIDS treatment is usually taken for life. It is very important to take treatment regularly, every day, to prevent the virus from replicating and to reduce the risk of developing AIDS. 11. The aim of HIV/AIDS treatment is to reduce the level of HIV in the blood (known as the viral load) to a very low level or to undetectable levels. 12. The viral load should be checked regularly, using a test called a viral load test. 13. If the level of HIV in the blood increases, or becomes detectable again after having been undetectable for a while, this is known as a breakthrough. 14. A breakthrough may mean that the HIV/AIDS treatment needs to be changed. 15. HIV/AIDS treatment may also have side effects. It is important to discuss any side effects with","1. Treatment for HIV/AIDS typically involves antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the virus and prevent AIDS-related illnesses. 2. ART medications block the virus from replicating, which reduces the amount of HIV in the blood. 3. The goal of treatment is to reduce the viral load to the point where it can't be detected, which is called an undetectable viral load. 4. An undetectable viral load means the virus can't reproduce, and the CD4 count can stay healthy. 5. If the CD4 count drops too low, opportunistic infections can set in. 6. Treatment for HIV/AIDS involves a combination of antiretroviral medications, which are usually a combination of three or more drugs. 7. The combination of medications is chosen based on the stage of HIV infection, the patient's health, and any other medical conditions the patient has. 8. The most commonly used types of antiretroviral medications include: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), Protease inhibitors (PIs), Integrase inhibitors, and Entry inhibitors. 9. NRTIs block the reverse transcriptase enzyme from making a copy of the HIV genetic material. 10. NNRTIs prevent the virus from binding to the immune cells it infects. 11. PIs stop the virus from being made. 12. Integrase inhibitors stop the virus from integrating its genetic material into the patient's DNA. 13. Entry inhibitors block the virus from entering healthy immune cells. 14.

"1. Introduction: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with a high prevalence rate and significant impact on quality of life. Previous studies have suggested a possible association between IBS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the nature of this association remains unclear. 2. Objectives: To investigate the association between IBS and PTSD and to explore the characteristics of IBS patients with PTSD. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles published between January 1990 and June 2017. 3. Results:Our results suggest that the association between IBS and PTSD is bidirectional. The prevalence of PTSD in IBS patients is higher than that in the general population. PTSD is associated with a younger age at IBS onset, a longer duration of IBS symptoms, and a higher prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder. 4. Conclusions:PTSD is associated with IBS, and IBS patients have a higher prevalence of PTSD. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism underlying this association.","1. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for more than a month after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play.","1.

Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. 3. The comorbidity of IBS and PTSD has been investigated in several studies. The results of these studies have been conflicting. Some studies have found an increased prevalence of PTSD in IBS patients compared to the general population, while others have not. Similarly, some studies have found an increased prevalence of IBS in PTSD patients, while others have not. 4. The aim of this paper was to perform a systematic review of the literature investigating the comorbidity of IBS and PTSD in order to clarify this area. We performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. We included all studies that investigated the comorbidity of IBS and PTSD, regardless of study design. Our search identified 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results of these studies suggest that there is an increased prevalence of PTSD in IBS patients compared to the general population, while there is some evidence to suggest that there is an increased prevalence of IBS in PTSD patients. Further research in this area is required."

If the hernia is painless, surgery is still the best option. Surgery is the only way to be sure that the hernia will not become worse. 6. What are the risks of an inguinal hernia?  The main risk is that the intestines may become stuck in the hernia. This can cause obstruction, which is a blockage of the intestines. The intestines can then become twisted and cut off from their blood supply. This is a medical emergency.",1. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommends that surgery be performed by a board-certified general surgeon or a board-certified urologist. 2. Surgery should be performed in an accredited facility. 3. Surgery should be performed only after a discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure. 4. The surgeon should have experience in performing this procedure and should perform it frequently. 5. The surgeon should use a surgical technique that is currently considered the best for this type of hernia. 6. The surgeon should use a local or regional anesthetic whenever possible. 7. The surgeon should use a non-absorbable suture material for repair. 8. The surgeon should use a prosthetic mesh or repair when indicated. 9. The surgeon should use a technique that is associated with the fewest complications and the best long-term outcome. 10. The surgeon should monitor the patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation during the procedure. 11. The surgeon should obtain consent for the procedure. 12. The surgeon should be prepared to manage any potential complications of the procedure. 13. The surgeon should be prepared to manage any potential complications of anesthesia. 14.

Pubic lice are tiny insects that live in pubic hair. They are also called ""crab lice"" or ""Pediculus pubis."" 2. Pubic lice are spread through close body contact, usually sexual contact with someone who has pubic lice or a related condition, such as another sexually transmitted disease. 3. The lice can be spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has pubic lice, or by using the same towel, clothing, bedding, or toilet seat. 4. You can get pubic lice even if you don't have sex. 5. To get rid of pubic lice, you can use one of these medicines: a. Permethrin cream, lotion, or shampoo (for example, Elimite or Nix). b. Lindane lotion or shampoo (for example, Kwell). c. Malathione lotion (for example, Ovide). d. These medicines are available by prescription. They are also available in some stores without a prescription. 6. You should wash all clothing and bedding in hot water. You should also comb the pubic hair to remove eggs (nits). Nits are tiny white or yellowish specks that you can scrape off pubic hair. 7. Pubic lice are usually not a sign of a serious disease. They are treated because they are annoying, and because the itching can lead to other problems, such as skin infections. 8.

"1. No one is to blame for obesity. Obesity is a complex condition and is the result of multiple factors including genetic, environmental, psychological, socioeconomic, cultural, and physiological factors. 2. Yes, putting a tax on junk food will reduce the amount of obese people. The tax will increase the price of unhealthy foods, making them less affordable and therefore reducing consumption. 3. Prevent obesity by increasing physical activity levels and improving diet quality. 4. Benefits of exercise include improved cardiovascular health, improved body composition, improved bone health, improved mood, and reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. 5. The government should be more involved in obesity prevention through public health campaigns, improved access to healthy foods, and increased opportunities for physical activity. 6. The number one thing to eat less of is empty calories (e.g., sugary drinks, processed foods).","1. Obesity is a complex issue, and there is no single cause. Factors that contribute to obesity include: 
a. Eating more calories than are burned through physical activity 
b. Consuming high-fat, high-sugar foods 
c. Eating too much junk food 
d. Not getting enough physical activity 
e. Spending too much time watching TV or playing video games 
f. Genetics 
g. Environmental factors such as the accessibility of food and the types of foods available 
h. Psychological factors such as stress and depression 
i. Other medical conditions or medications 
2. A junk food tax could be effective in reducing obesity rates if the money collected was used for obesity prevention programs. 
3. Preventing obesity involves encouraging healthy eating habits in children, providing easy access to healthy foods and physical activities, and teaching people how to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they burn. 
4. The advantages of engaging in 30 minutes of daily exercise and a healthy diet include: 
a. Weight loss 
b. Increased energy and stamina 
c. Improved sleep 
d. Stronger bones and muscles 
e. Lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers 
f. Improved mental health 
g. Lower risk of depression and anxiety 
h. Better self-esteem 
i. Improved social life 
5. The government should play a significant role in combating obesity because it is a public health issue that affects the health and well-being of the population. 
6. The most critical dietary component to limit or eliminate to combat obesity is foods high in sugar and/or fat.","1) The primary causes of obesity are the imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Factors that contribute to this imbalance include genetic susceptibility, the environment (food availability, palatability, cost, convenience), behavior (eating patterns, physical activity), and physiological factors (hormones, sleep). 2) No, I do not think that imposing a tax on unhealthy foods will lead to a decrease in obesity cases. The tax would have to be very high to make a difference and it would be very difficult to enforce. 3) Obesity can be prevented by encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity at an early age. Parents and caregivers should provide healthy food choices, limit sugary drinks and snacks, and encourage physical activity. Schools should provide nutritious meals and ample opportunities for physical activity. Communities should create safe spaces for play and provide access to affordable healthy foods. 4) Regular physical activity and healthy eating habits can improve one's overall health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, improve mood and cognitive function, and reduce health care costs. 5) Yes, I believe the government should take a more active role in addressing the obesity epidemic. The government can lead by example, for instance by providing healthy meals and opportunities for physical activity for employees. The government can also create policies that encourage healthy eating and physical activity, such as subsidizing healthy foods in schools and community centers, and increasing access to affordable healthy foods. 6) The dietary element that should be prioritized reducing or eliminating to tackle obesity is added sugars. Americans consume an average of 22 teaspoons of added sugars daily, which is well above the recommended limit of less than 12 teaspoons per day. Added sugars contain no nutrients but add calories and can displace nutritious foods in the diet.","1) The factors that contribute most to the prevalence of obesity are the availability and convenience of highly palatable, energy-dense foods and the reduced requirement for physical activity in contemporary society. 2) A tax on junk food may be effective in reducing the consumption of these foods and hence reducing obesity rates. However, the effectiveness of such a measure would depend on how the revenue generated by the tax was used. For example, if the tax revenue was used to subsidize the production of healthy foods then the tax may be effective. However, if the tax revenue was used to subsidize the production of unhealthy foods then the tax may not be effective. 3) Preventing obesity requires a multifactorial approach that includes education about the health consequences of obesity, the health benefits of physical activity and a balanced diet, as well as environmental and policy changes that encourage healthy eating and physical activity. 4) The advantages of regular exercise and a healthy diet include improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, improved mental health, and reduced risk of many cancers. 5) The government should be more involved in efforts to combat obesity. Obesity is a major public health problem that requires government intervention at the policy, environmental, and individual levels. 6) The most important dietary change we can make to reduce obesity is to reduce our consumption of highly palatable, energy-dense foods and to increase our consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.","1) The main causes of obesity are overeating and lack of exercise. 2) I don't think a tax on unhealthy foods would help reduce obesity. People would find ways around the tax. 3) Preventing obesity is done by eating healthy, exercising regularly, and avoiding overeating. 4) Benefits of exercising for 30 minutes daily and eating a healthy diet include weight loss, improved cardiovascular health, and a lower risk of diabetes and heart disease. 5) The government should not play a bigger role in addressing obesity. It is up to the individual to make the choice to be healthy. 6) We should limit our intake of fast foods and processed foods. We should also increase our intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.","1) The growing obesity problem is due to a combination of factors including the consumption of high calorie, nutrient poor foods, lack of physical activity, genetics, and other environmental factors. 2) Taxing junk food may be one way to reduce obesity rates, but it would need to be a significant tax in order to make a difference. 3) Preventing obesity begins with education at a young age about healthy food choices and exercise. Parents modeling healthy behaviors is also important. Schools should provide nutritious meals and encourage physical activity. Communities should create opportunities for physical activity. 4) The advantages of regular exercise and a balanced diet include a healthy body weight, reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, improved mood, improved self-esteem, and improved cognitive skills. 5) The government should take a prominent role in combating obesity by providing education and funding for research, programs to encourage healthy lifestyles, and policies that will"
"1. Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. People with this condition have a higher risk of developing colon cancer and rectal cancer. 2. Lynch syndrome is also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). 3. Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes. 4. The mutation can be inherited from a person's parents. It can also occur by chance if neither parent has the condition. 5. If a person has a DNA mismatch repair gene mutation, there is a 50% chance that they will pass it on to each of their children. 6. Lynch syndrome is most often diagnosed in people who have a family member with the condition. It can also be diagnosed when a person has several close family members with colon cancer or rectal cancer. 7. There are many different types of DNA mismatch repair genes. Which gene is affected may affect how the condition is passed down in the family and how severe it is. 8. People with Lynch syndrome may have more than one type of cancer. Some of the cancers seen in people with Lynch syndrome are: Colon cancer Rectal cancer Uterine cancer (in women) Ovarian cancer Stomach cancer Brain cancer (in people with a MLH1 gene mutation) 9. People with Lynch syndrome may also have non-cancerous (benign) changes in the colon. These changes can lead to an increased risk of colon cancer. Benign changes include: Fibromuscular polyps (increased number of polyps in the colon) Hyperplastic polyps (increased number of polyps in the colon) Adenomatous polyps (increased number of polyps in the colon) 10. The symptoms of Lynch syndrome are different for each person. Some people with the condition do not have any symptoms. 11. The doctor may use a family medical history, physical exam, and certain tests to diagnose Lynch syndrome. The tests may include: Colonoscopy (a procedure used to examine the colon and rectum) Biopsy (removal of tissue to be examined under a microscope) Genetic testing (a blood test to look for DNA mismatch repair gene mutations","1. Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. People with Lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin, and prostate. Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. 2. Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. The most common gene involved is MLH1. Other genes involved include MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, and TP53. 3. Lynch syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is usually inherited from a person's parents. 4. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. Autosomal means that the gene in question is located on one of the numbered, or non-sex, chromosomes. Dominant means that one copy of the gene is enough to cause the disorder. 5. People with Lynch syndrome often do not have any symptoms. It is usually found through genetic testing of people who have a family history of Lynch syndrome or related cancers. 6. If you have been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, you should talk with a doctor who specializes in cancer (oncologist). You should also talk with a doctor who specializes in inherited diseases (geneticist). 7. People with Lynch syndrome should have regular checkups. This includes colon and rectal exams, as well as exams of the skin, stomach, liver, and other parts of the body where cancer can occur. 8. There is no proven way to prevent colon cancer in people with Lynch syndrome. But it is important to have regular colon screening tests. Colon screening is usually done using imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI. 9. Screening for other cancers is also important. Women with Lynch syndrome should have regular pelvic exams and Pap smears to check for uterine cancer and ovarian cancer. Men should have regular checkups and tests for prostate cancer. 10.

Women with this condition also have a high risk of developing cancer of the ovaries and lining of the uterus (the endometrium). 5. People with Lynch syndrome may develop these cancers at younger ages than the general population. 6. The average age of diagnosis of colon cancer in people with Lynch syndrome is 45 years old. 7. Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene. 8. The MLH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mutL homologue 1. This protein is pa of a complex of proteins that is involved in repairing errors that occur during the replication of DNA. 9. The MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM genes provide instructions for making proteins that are also pa of this DNA repair complex. 10.

The most common type, which is open-angle glaucoma, is chronic and slowly progressive. Other types of glaucoma, such as angle-closure glaucoma, are acute and occur in sudden attacks.","1. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 3. There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. 4. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. It is chronic and usually develops slowly over time. 5. Closed-angle glaucoma, also called acute angle-closure glaucoma, is an emergency. It occurs when the fluid pressure inside the eye suddenly increases. 6. The increased pressure may happen because the eye is structurally abnormal, or because of other eye problems. 7. The goal of treatment for glaucoma is to lower the pressure in the eye. 8. Lowering eye pressure can help protect against optic nerve damage and loss of vision. 9. Treatments include prescription eyedrops, glaucoma surgery, and other options.","Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Here is information from the National Eye Institute (NEI) about glaucoma.  What is glaucoma?  Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  What causes glaucoma?  In open-angle glaucoma, fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly increases over time. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, the eye pressure will eventually cause damage to the optic nerve and may result in vision loss.  In closed-angle glaucoma, also called narrow-angle glaucoma, the fluid pressure in the eye suddenly increases. This can happen for a short time in some people with open-angle glaucoma, but it is more common in people with closed-angle glaucoma. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency because it can cause blindness in just a few days.  How is glaucoma diagnosed?  Your eye care professional will diagnose glaucoma with a comprehensive eye exam. This exam will include testing your visual acuity (sharpness), checking your refractive error, and measuring your intraocular pressure (IOP).  The IOP test is usually performed with an instrument called a tonometer.  What are the treatments for glaucoma?  The most common treatment for open-angle glaucoma is prescription eyedrops. These eyedrops lower the pressure in the eye by either reducing the amount of fluid produced or by increasing the drainage of fluid from the eye.  For closed-angle glaucoma, the immediate treatment is usually a laser surgery called iridotomy. This surgery creates a small hole in the iris, which allows the fluid pressure in the eye to balance and prevents further damage.  How can I prevent glaucoma?  You can help","1. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With open-angle glaucoma, the fluid pressure inside the eye slowly increases over time. 3. At first, there are no symptoms. Without treatment, people with open-angle glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. 4. The second form of glaucoma is narrow-angle glaucoma. With narrow-angle glaucoma, the fluid pressure in the eye suddenly increases. This can happen for a short time, or it can last for days. It can occur from time to time or it can happen regularly. With narrow-angle glaucoma, there is a sudden pain in the eye or a headache. There may be nausea, vomiting, and a red, swollen eye. The vision may become cloudy and then clear up, or it may remain clear. 5. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower the pressure inside the eye. The most common treatments are prescription eyedrops, laser treatments, and surgery.","1) The National Eye Institute (NEI) offers information on glaucoma, its treatment, and the role of glaucoma medications at https://nei.nih.gov/health/glaucoma/glaucoma-treatment 2) The Glaucoma Research Foundation provides information on glaucoma and its treatment at https://www.glaucoma.org/glaucoma-treatment 3) The American Academy of Ophthalmology offers information on glaucoma at https://www.aao.org/eyecare/glaucoma 4) The American Optometric Association offers information on glaucoma at https://www.aoa.org/patient-center/eye-conditions-and-disorders/glaucoma 5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information on glaucoma at https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/glaucoma/index.htm"

"1. You should know that there are two types of hemorrhagic strokes: intracerebral (inside the brain) and subarachnoid (in the space between the brain and the thin tissues that cover it). 2. Intracerebral hemorrhages are usually caused by high blood pressure, while subarachnoid hemorrhages are usually caused by a ruptured aneurysm. 3. The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is made by a CT scan of the head. 4. If the scan does not show any bleeding, the doctor may order a lumbar puncture to look for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. 5. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the doctor may order an MRI scan. 6. The treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on the cause and the severity of the bleeding. 7. If the bleeding is mild, the doctor may prescribe pain medication and observe the patient for signs of complications. 8. If the bleeding is severe, the patient may need surgery to relieve pressure on the brain and to look for complications. 9. The treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage depends on the cause and the severity of the bleeding. 10.

In 1995, two landmark studies were published that would change the way ovarian cancer was treated. The first study, conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), randomized 465 women with stage III and IV ovarian cancer to either cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy or paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy. This study showed that the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel resulted in a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to the other regimen. 1995 also saw the publication of the results of a study conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP). This study randomized 462 women with stage I and II ovarian cancer to either observation or adjuvant chemotherapy with the cyclical combination of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. This study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival in the group that received adjuvant chemotherapy. These two studies established cisplatin and paclitaxel as the chemotherapy regimen of choice for advanced ovarian cancer and cisplatin and carboplatin as the chemotherapy regimen of choice for early-stage ovarian cancer.","1) The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducted a study called the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT).

"Rubella is a serious disease. Rubella vaccine is given as part of a routine childhood immunization series. The first dose is usually given when the child is 12 to 24 months of age and the second dose is usually given when the child is 4 to 6 years of age.  Rubella vaccine is given to prevent birth defects and other complications that can result from rubella infection during pregnancy.  Rubella vaccine is very effective. Nearly all people who get vaccinated with 2 doses of the vaccine develop immunity to rubella.  Rubella vaccine is a live virus vaccine. It may cause mild problems such as:  - Joint pain  - Sore throat  - Fever  - Rash  - Small outbreaks of rubella may occur 6 weeks to 12 months after vaccination. These outbreaks can be spread to other, unvaccinated people.","Rubella is a viral infection that commonly affects children. It causes a rash and swollen lymph nodes. It's also called German measles.

"1. Riluzole: Riluzole is the only medication that has been proved to prolong life in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The medication is believed to interfere with the process by which the nervous system breaks down and recycles its own proteins, a process that is abnormal in ALS. Riluzole, which is taken by mouth, has been shown to prolong life by about three months. It is usually prescribed for patients with ALS who have difficulty swallowing. 2. Food: Avoid foods that are high in sodium (salt). High-sodium foods include processed foods such as canned soups, vegetables, and meats. Avoid foods that are high in cholesterol, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products. Eat a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. Eat lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. Limit your intake of fried and fatty foods.","1. Riluzole: Riluzole is the only medication that has been shown to prolong survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is believed to act by interfering with the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain that is believed to play a role in ALS. The medication is given at a dose of 100 mg twice a day. It is generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being fatigue and a skin rash. 2. Other medications: Other medications that have been studied in ALS and have failed to show a benefit include: Coenzyme Q10, creatine, glutamine, branched-chain amino acids, and pentoxifylline. 3. Healthy diet: A healthy diet is important for people with ALS. It should include plenty of fruits and vegetables and should be low in fat. A diet high in fiber can help prevent constipation, which is common in people with ALS.","1) Riluzole: This is the only medication that has been shown to modestly prolong life in patients with ALS. 2) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Some studies have suggested that NSAIDs may slow the progression of ALS. However, other studies have not shown any benefit. Therefore, the use of NSAIDs to treat ALS is still controversial. 3) Multivitamins and minerals: One study showed that a combination of multivitamins and minerals may slow the progression of ALS. However, this study was small and not well-designed. Therefore, more research is needed before recommending this treatment.","1.

Reynolds phenomenon is usually treated with calcium channel blockers.7. Reynolds phenomenon is not infectious and cannot be transmitted to others.","1. It is possible that your son has Raynaud's phenomenon. This is when the small blood vessels that supply blood to the fingers and toes narrow, causing the blood flow to be reduced. As a result, the skin on the fingers and toes may turn white, blue, or red.2. Raynaud's phenomenon is often associated with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma. It can also be caused by other factors, such as cold weather, stress, or use of certain medications.3. If your son has any other symptoms, such as joint pain or rash, it is important to discuss these with his doctor.4. If your son's symptoms are mild, he may only need to keep his hands and feet warm and avoid triggers. If the symptoms are severe, medication may be needed.","1. The symptoms you describe are consistent with a condition known as Raynaud's phenomenon. This is a common disorder characterized by episodic color changes in the fingers and toes, often triggered by cold or emotional stress.2. The typical sequence of events is as follows: The digits turn white due to a lack of blood flow, then turn blue due to pooling of blood, and finally turn red as the blood returns.3. In general, Raynaud's phenomenon is a benign condition, but it can be a marker for an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or scleroderma.4. In your case, the fact that the symptoms occurred after exposure to cold suggests a possible underlying autoimmune disorder.5. I would recommend that your son see a physician for a complete physical examination and a detailed medical history.","1.

1. Periventricular heterotopia is a malformation of coical development and is not associated with idiopathic scoliosis. 2. Idiopathic scoliosis is a deformity of the spine and is not associated with periventricular heterotopia. 3. The occurrence of periventricular heterotopia in your family appears to be a coincidence. 4. Scoliosis is a common problem and may occur in as many as 4% of otherwise normal individuals. 5. The fact that you and your sisters all have scoliosis suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition to the disorder in your family. 6.

A recent study has suggested that PVH may also be associated with idiopathic scoliosis (IS). 4. The study examined 10 patients with PVH and found that 7 of them had IS. 5. The researchers concluded that there appears to be a possible connection between PVH and IS. 6. However, more research is needed to fully understand the nature of this relationship.","1. Periventricular Heterotopia is a genetic condition that is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that are involved in brain development. 2. These genes are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. 3. A person with an X-linked condition has one copy of the altered gene in each cell. 4. A woman who has one copy of the altered gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to each of her sons or daughters. 5. Men who inherit the altered gene do not pass it on to their children. 6. There are no known genes on the Y chromosome that are associated with Periventricular Heterotopia. 7. A small percentage of people with Periventricular Heterotopia are diagnosed with other genetic conditions that are associated with brain development. 8. In these cases, the other genetic condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. 9. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Inheriting this altered gene does not necessarily affect a person's health. 10. In most cases, the cause of idiopathic scoliosis is unknown. 11. There is some evidence to suggest that genetics may play a role in the development of idiopathic scoliosis. 12. In some cases, there appears to be a familial tendency to develop idiopathic scoliosis. 13. In other cases, there appears to be an association between idiopathic scoliosis and certain connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). 14. In most cases, however, there is no apparent family history or association with other medical conditions."

"3-SCA3 3-Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 3-Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that causes progressive problems with movement. People with SCA3 have difficulty with balance, coordination, and walking. Problems with speech and swallowing can also occur. People with SCA3 may experience other symptoms such as muscle cramps, twitching, or wasting (atrophy) of the muscles. Some people with SCA3 may also have problems with involuntary movements or muscle stiffness.  The disease usually begins in adulthood, usually between ages 30 and 40 years. People with SCA3 may also have problems with thinking and reasoning (cognitive skills). Some people with SCA3 may have psychiatric symptoms, such as depression or hallucinations.  The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 14. The gene carries instructions for making a protein called ataxin-3. Researchers think that the mutation causes ataxin-3 to fold incorrectly, and the misfolded protein cannot perform its normal function. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. People with one copy of the mutated gene have the disease. People with SCA3 inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one affected parent. When parents have one child with SCA3, there is a 50 percent chance of the next child being affected.  Referencce:","Yes. MedlinePlus has several resources on SCA3.

This virus is contagious. You can reduce your chances of passing the virus to others by washing your hands frequently and not kissing or sharing food or utensils when you have a cold sore.  Cold sores usually go through stages, including:  - A prodrome (tender swelling of the skin before a sore appears).  - A small, raised, firm, painful, pink or red sore that quickly becomes yellow or white.  - A crusty lesion that slowly heals over 1 to 2 weeks.  You may have a prodrome, but you may not always have symptoms. A prodrome is a warning sign that a sore is about to appear. It is not fully developed, so it may not be noticed. Signs and symptoms of a prodrome include:  - Tingling, itching, or burning at the site before a sore appears.  - A small, firm swelling at the site before a sore appears.  - A cluster of small fluid-filled blisters that quickly become covered with a scab.  The prodrome phase may last 2 to 4 days, but it can last as long as 3 weeks. The sore can last 1 to 2 weeks.  You can treat cold sores by applying ice or a warm cloth to the sore. You can also apply a topical anesthetic to numb the pain. Do not smoke, because smoke can irritate the sore.  To reduce swelling and discomfort, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin.

"1. The treatment of HIV infection is constantly evolving. New guidelines are issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as soon as there is sufficient evidence to support a change in practice. The most uptodate HIV treatment guidelines can be found at the DHHS website (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines) and at the website of the Johns Hopkins HIV Guide lines (http://www.hopkins-hivguide.org/Hopkins-HIV-Guide-Lines.html). 2. The current standard of care for HIV infection involves the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The typical cART regimen consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor. 3. The choice of which drugs to use initially in a given patient is based on several factors, including the patient's HIV viral load and CD4 count, the presence of any co-morbid conditions, and the potential for particular drugs to interact with each other as well as with other medications the patient may be taking. 4. In general, the goal of initial therapy is to reduce the patient's viral load to <50 copies/mL and to increase the CD4 count to >350 cells/mL. 5. The most common side effects of NRTIs include nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy may be associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. 6. NNRTIs are generally well tolerated by most patients. The most common side effect of NNRTIs is rash, which usually resolves after a few weeks of therapy. 7. PIs are associated with several side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and lipodystrophy. In addition, PIs may interact with some common medications, including certain antibiotics (such as erythromycin), anticonvulsants (such as ph","1) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, regardless of CD4 count or symptoms. 2) The goal of treatment is to reduce HIV viral load to <50 copies/mL. 3) The preferred initial regimen is two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) + an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) + a NRTI. 4) The preferred alternative regimen is two NRTIs + a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) + a NRTI. 5) The preferred and alternative regimens should be used in combination with a pharmacological booster (e.g., ritonavir or cobicistat) for the PI or NNRTI, as needed, to achieve adequate drug levels. 6) The preferred and alternative regimens should include a fixed-dose combination product whenever possible. 7) All regimens should include at least one NRTI with demonstrated activity against HIV-2. 8) All regimens should include a drug with demonstrated activity against HBV. 9) All persons initiating ART should be offered a preventive therapy for HIV-associated opportunistic infections, such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis. 10) All persons initiating ART should be offered a complete screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and treatment for any identified infections. 11) All persons initiating ART should be offered a complete physical examination, including evaluation for oropharyngeal candidiasis, and a complete set of laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), basic chemistry panel, liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), and HIV viral load. 12) All persons initiating ART should be educated about adherence, medication side effects, and the importance of regular follow-up visits. 13) All persons initiating ART should receive a written treatment plan that includes information on adherence, side effects, and what to do if a","1) HIV-positive trans women should be started on ART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count or clinical symptoms. 2) The preferred first-line regimen for most patients is a two-drug regimen containing either lamivudine or emtricitabine + either tenofovir or abacavir. 3) The preferred third drug is either a boosted-protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. 4) The most important thing is to start treatment as soon as possible, because HIV will inevitably progress to AIDS if left untreated. 5) Treatment adherence is extremely important, so the regimen should be one that the patient can easily remember and follow. 6) Regular follow-up visits with the treating physician are also very important, so that any problems or side effects can be dealt with before they become serious. 7) The most important side effect to look out for is lipodystrophy, which can be minimized by using a regimen containing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. 8) If the patient has a history of injection drug use, they should be referred to a substance abuse treatment program, because this greatly increases the risk of HIV progression. 9) If the patient is also sexually active with men, they should be counseled on how to prevent transmission to their partners. 10) The most important thing is to get the patient into care as soon as possible, and to make sure they are able to adhere to the treatment regimen.","1. HIV positive patients should be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible after diagnosis, regardless of CD4 count or clinical symptoms. 2. The goals of ART are to: a. Reduce the viral load to undetectable levels b. Improve immune function c. Reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection 3. Current guidelines recommend starting with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase inhibitor, a protease inhibitor, or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). 4. The choice of which specific drugs to use within each class depends on several factors, including the patient's HIV subtype, the presence of any resistance-inducing mutations, and the patient's previous treatment history. 5. The most common side effects from ART are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 6. Lipid abnormalities are also common side effects of some ARVs, especially the protease inhibitors. 7. The most serious complications of ART are hepatotoxicity and the development of a syndrome known as lipodystrophy, which is characterized by abdominal fat accumulation, breast enlargement, and altered cholesterol levels. 8. The most commonly used prophylactic regimens are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluconazole. 9.

This means that if someone is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and has an undetectable viral load, they cannot transmit the virus to their sexual partner. This is a huge motivator for people to start and stay in treatment. 2) ART is a lifelong commitment: People need to understand that once they start ART, they are going to be on it for life. It is a commitment that they need to be ready for. 3) ART is not a cure: People need to understand that ART is not a cure for HIV. It is a management tool that helps people live with the virus. 4) Side effects: People need to be aware of potential side effects of ART and know how to manage them. 5) Adherence: Adherence is key to successful treatment. People need to understand the importance of taking their medication every day.","1. Hi, I am PMC-LLaMA.  I have read your question with care and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question : I'm Miranda Ramirez, working with Friends Community Center in Hollywood, California. I'm reaching out because I saw your HIV/AIDS treatment fliers and I'd love to learn more about the topic, as it pertains to our study on supporting HIV-positive transgender women. Answer : HIV is a viral infection which affects the immune system. It is a lifelong infection. People infected with HIV can live with it for many years if they take ART (anti-retroviral therapy). ART is a combination of 3 or more medicines. These medicines prevent the virus from multiplying and reduce the amount of virus in the body. ART also prevents the HIV from developing resistance. The goal of ART is to reduce the HIV in the body to such low levels that the virus can't be detected in the blood. This is called an undetectable viral load. An undetectable viral load means that the virus is not reproducing and is less likely to develop resistance. 2. The most important thing is that your patient should take ART regularly. He should not miss the doses. He should also take the medicine as per the schedule. 3. If he misses a dose, he should take the missed dose as soon as he remembers and then continue with the regular schedule. He should not double the dose to make up for the missed dose. 4. If he forgets to take a dose, he should continue with the regular schedule and not take the missed dose. He should not take double dose to make up for the missed dose. 5. If he is having problems with taking the medicine, he should talk to his treating doctor. There may be some solution to help him take the medicine. 6. He should also continue to take the medicine even if he feels better and thinks that he doesn't need it anymore. He should continue taking the medicine as prescribed by his treating doctor. 7. He should also continue to take the medicine even if he develops side effects. Most of the side effects are temporary and will go away after some time. He should talk to his treating"

It is due to obstruction of the airway at the back of the throat.4. The treatment is a CPAP machine.5. It is a device that delivers air under pressure to keep the airway open.6. It takes about 2 weeks to get used to it.7. Once you get used to it, you will be able to sleep comfortably.8. It will take around 2 months for the swelling to reduce.9. You should also lose weight and avoid alcohol and sedatives.","1. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout the night. 2. Central sleep apnea is a disorder that involves a pause in breathing while sleeping. It occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the breathing muscles. 3. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and stas. If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea. 4. In central sleep apnea, the muscles that control breathing aren't working properly. This causes breathing to stop and start. Central sleep apnea may occur as a result of a stroke, brain injury or infection. 5. In obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles that control breathing are working, but the airway is blocked. The blockage may be caused by extra tissue around the airway, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or other conditions. 6. Treatment for sleep apnea depends on the cause of the disorder. If you have sleep apnea, you may need a medical device to help you breathe at night. One such device is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. 7. A CPAP machine uses a mask to deliver air under pressure to your upper airway. The pressure keeps your airway open so you can breathe while you sleep. 8. You'll probably need to use a CPAP machine every night to help you breathe. It will make you feel more rested and alert during the day. 9. If you use a CPAP machine, you'll need to clean the mask and tubing every day. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. 10. If you're using a CPAP machine and you develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or a fast heartbeat, call your doctor right away.","1.

2 months to 6 months,"67. (Ref: Nelson 18th ed chapter 351) Jaundice is common in newborns. It is usually a benign condition called physiologic jaundice. It occurs during the first week of life and is due to the immaturity of the newborn liver. It can be recognized by the yellowing of the sclera and the presence of other signs of liver dysfunction, such as poor feeding, lethargy, and irritability. The serum bilirubin level is usually less than 10 mg/dL and the direct component accounts for less than 20% of the total serum bilirubin. The jaundice usually begins on the face and moves down to the trunk and extremities. It is rare for jaundice to be present in the first 24 hours of life. If jaundice is present at this time, the child should be evaluated for hemolytic anemia, galactosemia, and sepsis.","1. Jaundice is common in newborns because their liver is not yet fully developed. However, jaundice can occur at any age and may indicate a serious illness. 2. Jaundice is a yellowish staining of the skin and whites of the eyes. It is caused by high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of red blood cells. 3. Jaundice may be a sign of a problem with the liver, bile ducts, or red blood cells. It can occur with many different disorders, including: 4. Viral hepatitis 5. Biliary atresia 6. Physiologic jaundice 7. Gilbert's syndrome 8. Breast milk jaundice 9. Sepsis 10. Liver cancer 11. Other liver disorders 12. Hemolytic anemia",24 to 72 hours after birth,15-month-old infants are at risk of developing jaundice.,"2 weeks to 3 months of age is the most common time for jaundice to occur in infants. Jaundice can occur at any age in infants, although it is less common after 3 months of age."

5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and/or cisplatin are used as palliative treatments for inoperable schwannomas.,"Yes, large, inoperable schwannomas can be treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy has been used for many years to treat large, inoperable schwannomas.  It is thought that radiation may take years to shrink a tumor.  In some cases, the tumor will stop growing, but it will not shrink.  In other cases, the tumor will shrink after radiation treatment.  The goal of radiation therapy is to shrink the tumor so that it can be surgically removed.  Chemotherapy has also been used to treat large, inoperable schwannomas.  A recent study showed that 40% of patients treated with a combination of carboplatin and vincristine had a partial or complete response to treatment.  Partial or complete responses occurred in 58% of patients treated with a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Partial or complete responses occurred in 29% of patients treated with a combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine.  The goal of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumor so that it can be surgically removed.","5-Etretinate is an oral medication that has been used in the past with some success. However, the side effects of this medication (severe skin rashes, bony decalcification) have limited its use. More recently, the oral alkylating agent busulfan has been used with some success. In addition, several investigators have reported successful treatment of large and/or recurrent schwannomas with the biological agent octreotide. Octreotide is a synthetic analog of somatostatin that when given subcutaneously or by monthly intravenous infusion, produces sustained tumor shrinkage in approximately 50% of patients. The treatment is usually well tolerated, and the tumor shrinkage can be dramatic.","5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus radiotherapy is an effective treatment for large, inoperable schwannomas.","1. Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors. 2. These are slow growing tumors and may be very large at the time of diagnosis. 3. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic tumors. 4. In patients with unresectable tumors or in those who refuse surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an option. 5. SRS is a non-invasive technique that allows delivery of high doses of radiation to a defined volume in the brain. 6. It has been used with success in the treatment of intracranial schwannomas. 7. In this study, we review our experience with SRS for intracranial schwannomas and report treatment results and associated complications.","1) Large schwannomas may be treated with radiation therapy, but the tumor usually does not shrink. 2) There is no standard chemotherapy for schwannomas."

How can I find out if I have familial Mediterranean fever?,"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes). It is an autosomal recessive disease that most commonly affects individuals of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin (for its relation to fever) and encodes for a protein called marenostrin (for its relation to serositis). Marenostrin is expressed in neutrophils, and it is believed that it regulates the function of neutrophils. FMF is characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by any combination of the following: serositis (inflammation of serous membranes), synovitis (inflammation of the joints), and/or peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum). The attacks are typically accompanied by extreme fatigue and malaise. Attacks usually last 1-3 days and tend to recur at irregular intervals, with a tendency to cluster. The attacks are generally shorter and less severe with advancing age. In children, the first attack is usually severe and requires hospitalization.","Familial Mediterranean Fever is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes). The condition is common in the Mediterranean area, but other ethnic groups may also be affected.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes). 2. The first attack generally occurs in childhood or the teens and is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and pleuritic pain, with or without peritoneal or joint inflammation. 3. Subsequent attacks are usually shorter and less severe and may only involve fever and abdominal pain. 4. Between attacks, patients are usually well and have no signs or symptoms of disease. 5. Attacks can be triggered by physical exertion, emotional stress, or infection. 6. After an attack, patients usually have a moderate degree of tenderness in the abdomen and sometimes in the pleural or synovial areas. 7. The attacks generally last 1-3 days, and patients are fully recovered 1-2 weeks after an attack. 8. In patients with FMF, the risk of amyloidosis is increased. Amyloid deposits are found in the abdominal fat pad and in the synovium of affected joints. 9. In rare patients, end-stage renal disease may develop. 10. The most common laboratory finding is a moderate leukocytosis during an attack. 11. Serum levels of SAA (serum amyloid A) are increased during attacks. 12. There is no specific treatment for FMF. 13. Patients with FMF should avoid exercising or engaging in activities that result in sweating just before an attack. 14. Colchicine is effective in preventing attacks of FMF. 15. Patients with FMF should be educated about the signs and symptoms of amyloidosis so that they can report them to their physicians."
"1. The treatment is already available. You can use mouthwash containing Lidocaine to get relief from symptoms. 2. You should also consult your dentist to rule out any dental problems like oral candidiasis, oral lichen plans, dental caries etc. which can cause burning mouth sensation. 3. You can also take vitamin B complex supplements to reduce the symptoms.","The discovery of a biomarker that can identify the cause of burning mouth syndrome is a breakthrough that will lead to a treatment. The biomarker was discovered by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who published their findings in the journal Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Radiology, and Periodontology. The biomarker is a protein called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The researchers found that GABA is elevated in the saliva of people with burning mouth syndrome, and that it is also elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with the condition. The discovery of the biomarker means that a treatment for burning mouth syndrome could be developed. The researchers are working on a clinical trial to test a drug that blocks the action of GABA. If the drug is effective, it could lead to a treatment for burning mouth syndrome.",1. The underlying mechanism of burning mouth syndrome is still not clear. Our study provides evidence that the disorder is associated with a defect in the epithelial barrier of the oral mucosa. 2. The results of this study will help to develop new treatment strategies for burning mouth syndrome.,"1. The most common cause of burning mouth syndrome is believed to be a disorder of the nerves that control the sensations of burning and heat. This disorder is called peripheral neuropathy. 2. The exact cause of the nerve damage is unknown. Proposed causes include viral infections, such as herpes simplex, or injury to the nerves from dental problems, such as ill-fitting dentures or dental materials. 3.

That means it is given when no other condition can explain the symptoms. 3. Burning mouth syndrome is most common in middle-aged and older women. It is rare in children. 4. Burning mouth syndrome is not contagious. 5. Burning mouth syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder. It does not cause permanent damage to the glands. 6. The diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome is based on a person's medical history and a physical exam. The exam will include a","I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with this condition for so long. It's important to understand that burning mouth syndrome is a complex disorder with multiple underlying causes. As a result, treatment options are often tailored to the specific cause of the condition. For example, if a person is experiencing burning mouth syndrome due to a deficiency of vitamin B12, that person would be prescribed vitamin B12 supplements. If the condition is due to a medication side effect, the medication would be adjusted or discontinued.

In general, treatment options for burning mouth syndrome include:

1. Changing the diet to eliminate trigger foods and beverages
2. Using oral rinses or mouthwashes to soothe the tissue
3. Applying topical treatments to the affected area
4. Prescribing medication to alleviate symptoms
5. Referring the patient to a mental health professional if stress or anxiety is a contributing factor

In terms of when these treatments might become available, it depends on the specific cause of the condition. For example, if the burning mouth syndrome is due to a deficiency of vitamin B12, the patient could potentially begin taking vitamin B12 supplements immediately. However, if the condition is due to a medication side effect, the medication adjustment or discontinuation would need to be coordinated with the prescribing physician.

It's important to note that some treatment options may not be appropriate for everyone. For example, if the burning mouth syndrome is due to a viral infection, antiviral medications would not be effective.

"1. The symptoms of achalasia are caused by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, causing a back-up of food into the esophagus. 2. The exact cause of achalasia is unknown. 3. Symptoms usually begin as intermittent, which can include: Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Chest pain Coughing Regurgitation of undigested food during or shortly after a meal Weight loss 4. A barium swallow x-ray will show a ""bird's beak"" or ""rat's tail"" appearance. 5. Treatment options include: Endoscopic dilatation (pneumatic dilatation) Surgical myotomy (Heller's myotomy) Esophageal balloon dilatation Botulinum toxin injection 6. Botulinum toxin injection is an effective alternative to pneumatic dilatation, with similar efficacy and a lower complication rate. 7. Sildenafil (Viagra) has been used to treat achalasia with some success. 8. Spasms continue in the upper chest area because of the condition called as Achalasia cardia.","1.

No remedies are available to alleviate the spasms.","1. Yes, post-surgical spasms in the upper chest area can persist after surgery to treat achalasia. 2. The spasms can be stopped by taking medications such as calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or anticholinergics.","1. Post-operative spasms in the upper chest area are unlikely to continue in patients who have had surgery for achalasia. 2. The surgical procedure for achalasia involves cutting into the lower part of the esophagus (the LES). This area is close to the upper part of the stomach. The vagus nerve is in this area as well. The vagus nerve carries signals to the brain to let it know that the food is on its way. Cutting the vagus nerve during surgery may cause spasms in the chest area. 3. The surgical procedure for achalasia also involves cutting into the LES. This area is close to the lower part of the esophagus. The esophagus and the trachea (windpipe) are close to each other in this area. The surgeon must be careful not to cut the trachea. To help prevent this from happening, a tube is put into the trachea before surgery. The surgeon uses the tube to make sure the trachea remains open during surgery. 4. After surgery, the tube may cause spasms in the chest area. The surgeon will remove the tube as soon as it is safe to do so.","1. Achalasia surgery can lead to persistent chest pain and spasms. 2. The most common surgical procedure for achalasia is called a Heller myotomy. 3. In this operation, the surgeon cuts through the lower part of the esophagus. This allows food to pass into the stomach. 4. The surgical procedure is usually done through small incisions in the abdomen, using a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope. 5. The surgical procedure can be done in several ways. 6. The surgeon may make a large incision in the abdomen and open the lower part of the esophagus. 7. The surgeon may make several small incisions in the abdomen and use a tiny camera to guide the surgery. 8. The surgeon may also use a flexible endoscope to guide the surgery. 9. The surgical procedure may take 1 to 2 hours. 10. The patient may stay in the hospital overnight. 11. Recovery takes about 2 weeks. 12. Complications are rare but can include bleeding, infection, or leakage from the esophagus. 13. The operation is usually done before the person has severe pneumonia or a serious weight loss. 14. The operation is about 90 percent effective in relieving symptoms. 15. Some people have continued chest pain and spasms after the surgical procedure. 16. The operation does not cure the underlying condition. 17. The esophageal spasms may continue because of the muscle weakness. 18. The operation may need to be repeated. 19. Other treatment options may be used, including medicines, endoscopic dilatation, or injecting botulinum toxin into the lower part of the esophagus.",1. Post-operative spasms in the upper chest area can be alleviated by the use of oral medications such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines. 2.

"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but usually involves the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system attacks the tissues and organs. Lupus is treated with steroids and immunosuppressants.  Steroids are used to treat inflammation and suppress the immune system. They are the mainstay of treatment for lupus. Steroids can be taken by mouth, as creams or ointments, or intravenously.  Immunosuppressants are medicines that suppress the immune system. They are used to treat severe lupus. Examples of immunosuppressants include azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil.  I hope this will help you. Best wishes, Mehrnaz","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect different organs and tissues in the body. It can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs, and brain. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, is a chronic disease that can be mild to life-threatening. Another type is acute cutaneous lupus, which is a mild form that mostly affects the skin. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.  Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women than in Caucasian women. The cause of lupus is not known. Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are joint pain or swelling, muscle pain, fatigue, fever, chest pain, and mouth ulcers. There is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or years to make the diagnosis. There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.","Treatment for lupus depends on the symptoms and how severe they are. Most people with lupus can control the disease with medicines.  People with mild disease may only need NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or corticosteroids.  NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Corticosteroids include prednisone and hydroxychloroquine.  For more severe symptoms, doctors may prescribe antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents.  Doctors may also prescribe medicines to help prevent flares and organ damage.  People with lupus may need to see different doctors. A rheumatologist is a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles, including lupus.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive problems with balance and coordination. 2. The most common cause of Friedreich ataxia is a mutation in the FXN gene. 3. The symptoms of Friedreich ataxia usually begin in childhood or adolescence and get worse over time. 4. There is currently no cure for Friedreich ataxia. 5. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and helping individuals live as normal a life as possible. 6. Researchers are working on several treatments for Friedreich ataxia.,"1. Friedreich ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that usually begins in childhood. It causes muscle weakness and coordination problems. It gets worse over time and can lead to disability. 2. The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 9. The gene carries instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Researchers think that the loss of frataxin causes nerve cells in the spinal cord to die. 3. Friedreich ataxia is most often inherited from a person's parents. It is less often caused by a new mutation in a gene. 4. Friedreich ataxia is most common in people of European descent. Men and women have an equal chance of getting it. 5. Symptoms usually appear before age 25. They include: Trouble with balance and walking. Muscle weakness. Speech problems. Changes in the heart. Problems with vision. Problems with hearing. 6. The disease is treated with drugs to help symptoms. Physical therapy and braces or wheelchairs can also help. 7. Researchers are testing a number of drugs for Friedreich ataxia. One of the drugs, called idebenone, is being tested in a placebo-controlled study. This means that some people will get the real drug and some people will get a fake drug (a placebo) in this study. The study will compare the two groups to see if idebenone slows the progress of Friedreich ataxia. Another drug, called pregabalin, is being studied in a small, phase II clinical trial. This study will look at how safe and effective the drug is in treating Friedreich ataxia. 8. Other drugs are being studied in mice. These drugs include: Coenzyme Q10. Creatine. Glutamate. 9. Researchers are also testing vitamins and other supplements that might help delay symptoms of Friedreich ataxia. 10. Researchers are also testing gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia. This involves injecting a gene into cells. The goal of gene therapy is to help the body make the protein it cannot make because of the mutation. 11. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and St","1. What is Friedreich ataxia? Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the nerves. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most people who have this disorder have an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the Friedreich ataxia gene (FRDA). This expansion results in decreased production of frataxin, a protein that is important for normal development and function of the nervous system. 2. What are the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia? Symptoms usually appear in childhood or adolescence and include: - unsteady gait and difficulty with coordination (ataxia) - muscle weakness (myopathy) - loss of sensation (dysesthesia) - impaired speech and swallowing - heart problems (cardiomyopathy) - diabetes - loss of reflexes (areflexia) - swelling of the feet and ankles 3. What are the treatments for Friedreich ataxia? There is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the symptoms and includes: - physical therapy to help maintain mobility and function - orthopedic devices such as braces or wheelchairs - medication for pain and muscle spasms - specialized equipment to help with activities of daily living such as eating and dressing 4. Are there any new treatments for Friedreich ataxia? Research is ongoing to find a cure or effective treatment for Friedreich ataxia. Several clinical trials are currently enrolling patients. These trials are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and therapies. One of the most promising therapies for Friedreich ataxia is idebenone, a compound related to the antioxidant coenzyme Q10. Clinical trials have shown that idebenone can improve heart function and reduce the progression of ataxia. However, more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and risks. Other potential therapies include: - coenzyme Q10 - vitamin E - minocycline - anti-","1. The treatment for Friedreich ataxia is still in the research stage and has not been approved by FDA for use in humans. 2. Clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating Friedreich ataxia with gene therapy. 3. Gene therapy involves the introduction of a normal gene into the body to replace a defective gene. 4. This approach has been successful in animal studies. 5. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating Friedreich ataxia with gene therapy. 6. These trials will determine if gene therapy is safe and effective in humans with Friedreich ataxia. 7. It is hoped that this treatment will slow the progression of Friedreich ataxia, improve the ability to perform daily activities, and improve the length and quality of a patient's life.","1.

"1. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. 2. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert (inactive) and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. 3. The first occurs in the liver and conves vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcidiol. The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcitriol. 4. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany. It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. 5. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation. 6. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D is the most reliable indicator of vitamin D status. It is the best test for assessing vitamin D deficiency. 7. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has established dietary guidelines for vitamin D intake based on the prevention of vitamin D deficiency and the maintenance of bone health. It recommends 600 IU (15 μg) of vitamin D per day for all individuals aged 1-70 years. It recommends 800 IU (20 μg) of vitamin D per day for all individuals aged 71 years and older. 8.

High calcium, high vitamin D, and low phosphorus levels may indicate hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone.2. Hyperparathyroidism may be caused by a tumor of the parathyroid gland, which is a small gland located behind the thyroid gland in the neck.3. Other symptoms of hyperparathyroidism may include weakness, fatigue, kidney stones, and bone pain.4. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is confirmed by measuring parathyroid hormone levels in the blood.5. Treatment may include surgical removal of the affected gland.","1. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a steroid hormone. It is involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphorous metabolism, and in the mineralization of bone and teeth. 2. The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, increases the uptake of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorus (P) from the intestine, and increases the release of calcium and phosphorus from bone. 3. The main source of vitamin D in the body is synthesis in the skin, as a result of exposure to sunlight. 4. The amount of vitamin D produced by this method is dependent on environmental factors, such as the intensity of sunlight, and individual factors, such as the amount of skin surface area exposed, and the time of day. 5. Vitamin D is also found in food, such as fatty fish, egg yolks and liver. 6. The recommended daily allowance of vitamin D is 200-400 IU (5-10 mg). 7. Vitamin D has also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and in the prevention of some types of cancer. 8. High levels of vitamin D may cause high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), and high levels of calcium can cause problems with the function of the kidneys, heart and nervous system.","1. Yes, it is possible that high vitamin D levels are due to pituitary gland dysfunction. 2. The pituitary gland produces a hormone called ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. 3. Cortisol is a hormone that has many functions including regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, and also helps in the conversion of vitamin D to its active form in the kidneys. 4. If there is a problem with the pituitary gland, it may not be producing enough ACTH, and this could lead to low cortisol levels. 5. Low cortisol levels can result in high vitamin D levels due to decreased conversion of vitamin D to its active form in the kidneys. 6. It is important to discuss this possibility with your sister's treating physician and have her pituitary gland function tested.","1. Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. It is also found in some foods.2. The body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the building blocks of bone.3.

"1. Lung cancer is most commonly caused by smoking tobacco.2. Family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for developing lung cancer.3. If your mother-in-law was diagnosed with lung cancer, then she should undergo genetic testing for mutation in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ALK, RET, MET, HER2 genes.4. If she has a mutation in any of these genes, then your husband and son have a higher risk of developing lung cancer.5. Smoking tobacco is the most common cause of lung cancer, however, if your husband or son smoke, their risk of developing lung cancer increases.6. You can consult with a genetic counselor for further information.","Yes, genetic testing can help determine if a lung cancer is genetic.  A genetic test can help identify a gene mutation that may be responsible for the cancer.  The test can compare your husband's and his sisters' DNA with the DNA of the cancer cells to see if there are any matching mutations.  If a mutation is found, it can help determine if other family members are at risk for developing the cancer.  It's important to remember that just because a person has a gene mutation that increases the risk of cancer, it doesn't mean they will definitely develop the disease.  Many factors affect the risk of developing cancer, including exposure to certain substances, such as tobacco smoke, and inherited gene mutations.","It is possible that there is a genetic component to the lung cancer in your mother-in-law.  However, it is not clear whether there is a single gene that is responsible or whether there are multiple genes that contribute to the risk.  A genetic analysis of the family history may provide some insight, but it is unlikely to provide definitive information.  It is more likely that there is some environmental exposure that is responsible for the lung cancer in your family members.  If you are concerned about your husband's risk, he may want to consider talking to his doctor about getting screening tests for lung cancer.  This would involve periodic CT scans to look for early signs of lung cancer.","1. Yes, it would help identify if the cancer is hereditary. 2. The testing process would involve obtaining a blood sample from your husband and his sisters. 3. The blood sample would be sent to a laboratory where a geneticist would analyze the DNA for any mutations in the known lung cancer genes. 4. If a mutation is identified, then the children will need to be tested for this mutation. 5. If the mutation is present in the children, then their risk for lung cancer is greatly increased. 6. If the mutation is not present in the children, then their risk is no different from the general population.","It is possible that there is a genetic component to your husband's family history of lung cancer.  However, it is important to understand that most cases of lung cancer are due to environmental factors, such as smoking.  Testing your husband and his family members may provide some insight into the genetic component of the disease, but it is not likely to be definitive.  You should discuss your concerns with your husband's primary care physician, who may be able to provide more information on the risks and benefits of testing.","1. Yes, it is possible to detect the genetic mutation responsible for the lung cancer in your husband and his sisters by comparing their DNA with your mother-in-law's DNA. 2. The test will determine if the cancer is inherited. 3. The test will also determine if your husband and his sisters are at risk of developing the disease. 4. The test will not determine how to protect him. 5. To determine how to protect him, you need to know the specific mutation responsible for the cancer in your mother-in-law and his sisters. 6. If the test identifies a mutation, then your husband and his sisters can be tested to see if they inherited the mutation. 7. If they did not inherit the mutation, then they are not at risk of developing lung cancer. 8. If they did inherit the mutation, then there are steps they can take to protect themselves, such as avoiding smoking and having regular lung cancer screenings."

It is characterized by episodes of weakness or paralysis (called spells) that may be triggered by infection, stress, or changes in the infant's environment. 2. Leigh disease is caused by a mutation in the PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, MITOCHONDRIAL gene (also known as the ETCB gene). This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of enzymes called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex plays an important role in the production of energy within cells. 3. Mutations in the PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, MITOCHONDRIAL gene result in a deficiency of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This deficiency prevents cells from producing energy properly. 4. There is no known effective treatment for Leigh disease. 5. EPI743 is a new experimental drug that has been shown to activate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in cell models. 6.

Some of the new developments include:  - A new type of scan called an [18]F-FDG PET scan that can help doctors find out whether a tumor is likely to be cancerous or not.  - A new type of radiation therapy called Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver high doses of radiation to small areas of the body.   - New types of radiation therapy such as Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IM) that can better target tumors and limit damage to healthy tissue.  - New types of surgery such as minimally invasive surgery that uses special tools to remove tumors through small incisions.  - New targeted therapies that are designed to interfere with specific molecules in cancer cells or in the tumor's environment.  - New vaccines that help the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells.  - Clinical trials of new treatments that are being studied to find out whether they are safe and effective.","1. A new type of immunotherapy called neoantigen therapy is being studied in clinical trials. This therapy is designed to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells by creating personalized vaccines from the patient's own cancer cells. 2. Another type of immunotherapy being studied in clinical trials is called adoptive cell transfer (ACT). This therapy involves removing immune cells (called T-cells) from the patient's blood, changing them in the laboratory, and giving them back to the patient. The changed cells then attack cancer cells. 3. New drugs are also being studied in clinical trials. These drugs target specific molecules in cancer cells or affect the ways cancer cells grow or survive. 4. Other targeted therapies that are being studied include drugs that target certain proteins or molecules in cancer cells. These proteins or molecules can play important roles in cancer cell growth. 5. New combinations of chemotherapy drugs are also being studied in clinical trials. These combinations may work better than current treatments. 6. A new type of treatment being studied in clinical trials involves injecting a cancer-fighting virus into tumors. This treatment is being studied in clinical trials for melanoma, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer."

Orlistat: This medication reduces the amount of dietary fat that is absorbed from the small intestine. It achieves this by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipases. These enzymes are normally responsible for breaking down dietary fats into fatty acids which are then absorbed from the small intestine. Orlistat inhibits this process, thereby reducing the amount of fat that is absorbed from the diet. This fat is usually absorbed along with dietary fats and can be stored as body fat. By reducing the amount of fat that is absorbed from the diet, weight loss can occur. 2. Sibutramine: This medication is an appetite suppressant. It works by increasing the amount of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. These neurotransmitters are normally involved in regulating mood and appetite. Sibutramine increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby decreasing appetite. 3. Guarana: This is a herbal supplement that is commonly used for weight loss. It is derived from the guarana plant. Guarana is a source of caffeine, which is a central nervous system stimulant. Caffeine increases the breakdown of fats and can increase the metabolic rate. This can lead to weight loss. 4. Ephedrine: This is another herbal supplement that is commonly used for weight loss. It is derived from the Ephedra plant. Ephedrine stimulates the central nervous system and can increase the breakdown of fats. It can also increase the metabolic rate, which can lead to weight loss."
"1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a treatment modality used in many diseases. 2. The pathophysiology of Meniere's disease is not completely understood, but it is thought to be caused by disturbances in the endolymphatic circulation. 3. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HBO in patients with Meniere's disease. 4. Twenty-four patients with a diagnosis of Meniere's disease according to the criteria of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were included in the study. 5. Patients were treated with 2 sessions of HBO per day for 10 days at a pressure of 1.5 ata. 6. The results of the study showed that HBO was effective in reducing the frequency of vertigo attacks, increasing the time interval between attacks, and improving the quality of life in patients with Meniere's disease. 7. HBO was found to be a safe treatment modality.","1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a treatment in which a patient breathes 100 percent oxygen at a pressure two to three times greater than normal atmospheric pressure. The increased pressure allows more oxygen to be dissolved in the blood. 2. The treatment is most often used to treat decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning, and gas embolism. It is also used to treat a type of tissue damage that occurs when blood flow to a particular area of the body is blocked or reduced. This damage can occur in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have had a stroke. 3. HBO is also being studied in the treatment of other conditions such as: 4. brain injuries 5. chronic wounds 6. certain cancers 7. coronary artery disease 8. skin grafts and flaps 9. frostbite 10. radiation injuries 11. sickle cell disease and 12. tissue flaps (pieces of skin, fat, and muscle used in plastic surgery for breast reconstruction after mastectomy). 13.

This therapy is sometimes used for people who have circulatory problems in their inner ears. 3. This review was written to find out if there is scientific evidence about the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for people with Meniere disease. 4. The review found two studies of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for Meniere disease. Both studies were of low quality. 5. One study found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improved peoples' hearing and reduced the number of attacks in people with Meniere disease. The other study found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not help people with Meniere disease. 6. More research is needed on the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for Meniere disease.","1. No, I don't have any knowledge about the outcomes of Hyperbaric treatment for people with Meniere's disease.","1. Meniere's disease is a common disorder of the inner ear that affects 10 to 15 out of 1000 people. It is characterized by vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sensation of fullness in the ear. 2. The exact cause of Meniere disease is unknown. It is thought to be due to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the inner ear. This causes the pressure to increase, which may result in hearing loss and a spinning sensation. 3. The symptoms of Meniere disease may come and go. They often get worse over time, but usually stay the same once they have stabilized. 4. The main symptom of Meniere disease is vertigo. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating, and a feeling of warmth. Hearing loss, ringing in the ear, and a feeling of fullness in the ear may also occur. 5. Diagnosis of Meniere disease is based on the patient's medical history and a physical exam. A hearing test (audiometry) and maneuvers that test for nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and postural stability (balance) may also be performed. 6. There is no cure for Meniere disease. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms. Medications such as antihistamines, anticholinergics, and diuretics may be used to relieve vertigo and nausea. Some people with Meniere disease experience improvement in their symptoms when treated with a low-salt diet. 7. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment has been used to treat patients with Meniere disease. The rationale for this treatment is that the increased pressure in the hyperbaric chamber may improve the symptoms of Meniere disease by forcing more oxygen into the inner ear."

The brain can relearn to see after eye muscle surgery to correct strabismus (crossed eyes). 2. This is done by patching one eye for a few days and then alternating patching to allow the brain to relearn how to see. 3. The patch over one eye blocks the vision in that eye and forces the brain to use the other eye. 4. This process is called ""occlusion therapy"" and it is the most important part of the treatment for strabismus. 5. Occlusion therapy can be done at home by using an eye patch or an eye patch attached to glasses. 6. The more the eye patch is used, the better the results will be. 7. Occlusion therapy should be done for several hours a day, every day, until the next eye muscle surgery is done. 8. The brain relearning process works best in young children and can also work in adults. 9. Adults may have more problems with eye muscle surgery and patching than children. 10. Adults may have more problems with double vision when the patch is first applied. 11. The patch may cause problems with depth perception and may make it hard to judge distances and step off of curbs or stairs. 12.

Patching is a common non-invasive method of treatment. The eye patch forces the ""good"" eye to work harder, which stimulates the ""lazy"" eye to work harder, too. 3. Vision therapy is another common non-invasive method of treatment. Vision therapy is a series of eye exercises that are designed to change the way the eyes work. 4. Surgery is a type of invasive treatment. Surgery is usually performed after age 4. The most common surgery for amblyopia is called patching. In this procedure, the eye patch is removed and the eye is then forced to work harder. 5. Stem cell research is being done to try to restore vision in people with amblyopia.","1. Stem cells are being used in research to treat muscular problems such as strokes, heart disease, and arthritis. 2. Stem cells are also being used in research to treat problems of the eye, such as macular degeneration and cataracts. 3. Stem cell therapy for strabismus is still in its infancy. 4. The first clinical trials using stem cells to treat strabismus are just beginning. 5. The use of stem cells to treat strabismus will likely be a slow process as researchers determine the best way to use the cells. 6. It is likely that it will take at least 10 years before stem cell therapy is commonly used to treat strabismus. 7. The use of stem cells to treat strabismus is very exciting. 8. The use of stem cells will likely allow for better and more complete correction of strabismus. 9. It is likely that in the future, strabismus surgery will be able to be performed much earlier in life, possibly even in infancy, with better and more complete results."

It is possible for a woman to get pregnant after having sex during her menstrual period, but the chances of getting pregnant are very low. 3. The first week and the last 10 days of a woman's menstrual cycle are considered safe periods. It is unlikely that a woman will get pregnant during these times, even if she has unprotected sex.","1. Yes, a girl can get pregnant if she has sex during her fertile period, which is the time when ovulation occurs. 2. The first day of the girl's period is considered day#1. 3. The last day of the girl's period is considered day#5. 4. The girl's fertile period is considered to be days 1-10 of her period (the first day of bleeding is considered day#1). 5. A girl can get pregnant if she has sex during any of these days: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 6. A girl cannot get pregnant if she has sex during these days: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.","3 days after a girl starts her menstrual period is too early for her to become pregnant. 

Pregnancy occurs when a sperm from a man fertilizes an egg in a woman's body. 

Sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to 5 days. The egg, however, can only survive for 1 day. Therefore, for pregnancy to occur, sexual activity must take place between 5 days before and 1 day after a woman's egg is released. 

A girl's egg is released during the middle of her monthly menstrual cycle. A woman's menstrual cycle is the repeating cycle of changes that occur in a woman's body over about 28 days. 

The first day of a woman's menstrual cycle is the first day of her period. The last day of a woman's menstrual cycle is the day before she starts her next period. 

During the first part of a woman's menstrual cycle, her body produces estrogen. Estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and prepare for a fertilized egg. Estrogen levels stay high for about 14 days. Then, as the estrogen levels drop, the uterine lining sheds, causing a woman's period. 

After the period, for about 5 days, the body produces progesterone. Progesterone causes the uterine lining to continue preparing for a fertilized egg. Progesterone levels stay high for about 5 days. 

The egg is released about 14 days before a girl starts her next period. Therefore, if a girl has sexual activity 5 days before she starts her next period, there is a chance that she could become pregnant. 

However, if a girl has sexual activity 3 days after she starts her period, there is no chance that she could become pregnant because the egg has already been released and the body is producing progesterone. 

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible for a girl to become pregnant if she engages in sexual activity 3 days after she starts her menstrual period.",0%,"1.

"1. Crossed eyes are not a disease in themselves, but a symptom of a problem with the eyes or visual system.2. The eyes are controlled by six muscles, three in each eye.3. These muscles are attached to the eyeball so that the eyes can move in six different directions.4. One of the muscles in each eye is extra strong. This muscle is called the ""medial rectus."" Its job is to pull the eye inward toward the nose.5. In a person with normal vision, when the eyes are looking straight ahead, the medial rectus muscle is pulling the eye straight inward.6. In a person with crossed eyes, the eye on the right side is looking inward toward the nose while the eye on the left side is looking outward toward the ear.7. This happens because the right eye's medial rectus muscle is stronger than its lateral rectus muscle, and the left eye's medial rectus muscle is weaker than its lateral rectus muscle.8. This difference in muscle strength causes the eyes to be crossed, or ""cross-eyed.""9. Crossed eyes can be caused by problems with the eye muscles or with the nerves that control the eye muscles.10. Problems with the eye muscles are usually present at birth. They are often caused by the baby being born too early.11. Problems with the nerves that control the eye muscles can occur later in childhood. They are often caused by damage to the brain or spinal cord.12. Crossed eyes can also be caused by problems with the bones of the eye socket or with the muscles that hold the eyes in place.13. These problems can develop at any age.14. To fix crossed eyes, the stronger eye must be made to look straight.15. In a child, this is often done with eye exercises and/or eyeglasses or contact lenses.16. In an adult, surgery is usually needed.",1. Corrective lenses: Corrective lenses can help improve your vision. You may need glasses or contact lenses. 2. Eye muscle surgery: Eye muscle surgery is another option. It can help correct the eye alignment problem. But it may not always work for everyone. 3. Vision therapy: Vision therapy is a series of eye exercises. They can help your eyes work together better. 4. Orthoptic surgery: Orthoptic surgery is a type of eye surgery. It can help correct eye alignment problems. But it may not always work for everyone.,"1) The first step is to have a complete eye examination by an ophthalmologist. 2) If the cause of the cross-eyes is due to a problem with the eye muscles or nerves, surgery may be necessary. 3) If the cross-eyes is due to a problem with the bones of the eye socket, surgery may be necessary.","1. Crossed Eyes (Congenital Strabismus) Crossed eyes (congenital strabismus) is a condition in which a baby's eyes are not properly aligned. The condition occurs in about 2 to 4 out of every 100 children. 2. Crossed Eyes Treatment The goal of treatment for crossed eyes is to align the eyes so that a single image is seen. This is usually done by using eyeglasses or, more often, by using eyeglasses along with vision therapy exercises. 3. Vision Therapy Vision therapy is a series of exercises designed to change the way the eyes work. The goal of vision therapy is to improve eye coordination and eye focusing. With vision therapy, the eye that looks inward (the ""crossed"" eye) will become stronger. The weak eye will get weaker, and the ""crossed"" eye will straighten. 4. Surgery Surgery is another way to correct crossed eyes. It is usually done if vision therapy does not work. The surgery is done on the eye muscles. It straightens the eyes but can also weaken the eyes. 5. Prevention There is no known way to prevent crossed eyes (congenital strabismus).",1.

The goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor, or as much as possible, and to save as much kidney as possible. 3) Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams (radiation) to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. It can be used alone or in addition to surgery or chemotherapy. 4) Biological therapy: Biological therapy, also called targeted therapy, is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells with specific molecules. 5) Cryotherapy: Cryotherapy (cryoablation) is a procedure to freeze and destroy abnormal cells. It may be used to treat kidney cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. 6) Hyperthermia: Hyperthermia is a procedure in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells. 7) Hormone therapy: Hormone therapy is a type of treatment that blocks the use of hormones, which are substances that travel through the bloodstream and control the growth and activity of certain types of cells. Hormones can stimulate the growth of some types of kidney cancer. Removing the source of the hormones may help stop or slow the growth of some kidney cancers. 8) Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. The drugs used in immunotherapy are made from substances that help the body's immune system work.

This may be an option if the cancer is causing no symptoms or if the symptoms can be managed. 2) Surgery - removing the cancer in an attempt to cure the disease. Surgery may be the best option if the cancer has not spread and if it can be removed completely. 3) Radiation therapy - using high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Radiation may be used instead of surgery or after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the area. 4) Chemotherapy - using drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often used to treat cancers that have spread. It may also be used when cancer cannot be removed by surgery. 5) Biological therapy - using your body's immune system to fight cancer cells.

Performing resistance training targeting the major muscle groups for 8-10 repetitions with moderate to high intensity and with short rest intervals between sets is important for countering sarcopenia.,"1. Strength training is the best way to build muscle mass and strength. Exercises that use muscle groups in a functional pattern are the most beneficial. For example, use exercises that involve the legs, hips, back, chest, shoulders, and arms in activities such as walking, climbing stairs, lifting, and carrying. 2. To build strength, you must progressively overload the muscles. Overloading can be accomplished by increasing the resistance (weight, tubing, or bands), increasing the number of repetitions, or increasing the speed of movement. 3. To build strength, you must also allow enough rest and protein for recovery. Muscles grow when they are exposed to stress (overload) and recover between stresses. 4. Muscle strength declines with age, but this process can be slowed with resistance training. Older adults can increase strength and muscle mass with resistance training, but it takes more effort and longer periods of training than it takes for a younger person. 5. Resistance training is effective for older adults at all levels of physical functioning. Even frail elderly patients with chronic illness can increase strength with carefully prescribed programs. 6. Resistance training is safe for older adults, but injuries can occur. To minimize the risk of injury, advise older adults to start slowly, with low resistance and short sessions. As muscle strength increases, resistance and session duration can be increased. 7. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that older adults perform a full range of resistance training exercises, beginning with 1 set of 10 repetitions and progressing to 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each of the following muscle groups: upper body (shoulder girdle), lower body (hip girdle), and upper and lower extremities (arms and legs)."

"1. The symptoms are suggestive of a condition called ""Phenylketonuria"" (PKU). 2. It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to process a substance called phenylalanine, which is an amino acid found in most proteins. 3. PKU is caused by a defect in the gene that makes an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. 4. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine into another amino acid called tyrosine. 5. People with PKU cannot make this enzyme, so their bodies are unable to break down phenylalanine. 6. This causes a buildup of phenylalanine in the blood, which can lead to mental retardation and other serious health problems. 7. Babies with PKU do not show any symptoms at birth. 8. They usually get diagnosed with this condition during a routine screening test at about 10 days to 2 weeks old. 9. The test involves taking a small amount of blood from the heel of the infant. 10. If the test result shows high levels of phenylalanine, then the baby may be referred to a specialist for further testing. 11. Infants with PKU must stay on a special diet that is low in phenylalanine. 12. This means they must avoid foods that contain phenylalanine, such as meat and dairy products. 13. The diet must be followed carefully to prevent mental retardation and other complications. 14. Infants with PKU must be monitored regularly by a doctor or dietitian who is experienced in managing this condition. 15. The diet restrictions usually need to be followed for life. 16. Adults with PKU may take a higher protein diet than children with PKU. 17. They may also have more freedom in choosing foods that contain moderate amounts of protein. 18. However, they must still avoid foods that contain large amounts of phenylalanine. 19. Infants with PKU may be given a medication called pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to help reduce the amount of phenylalanine in the","Yes, we can help!

Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be managed effectively with proper medical treatment. 2. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease, so that you can maintain optimal lung function and a normal quality of life. 3. Asthma treatment involves two types of medicines: quick-relief (rescue) medicines to treat symptoms, and control medicines to prevent symptoms. 4. Quick-relief medicines are used to treat sudden and severe asthma symptoms. They include inhaled bronchodilators (medicines that open the airways), such as short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, and short-acting anticholinergics. 5. Control medicines are used to prevent asthma symptoms. They include inhaled corticosteroids, long-term control medicines, leukotriene modifiers, mast cell stabilizers, and other medicines. 6. In addition to medicines, you can take steps to help manage asthma. These include avoiding things that trigger your symptoms, such as smoke and air pollution, and making sure that you are well hydrated. 7. If you have moderate to severe asthma, you should receive allergy shots (immunotherapy) to help reduce your allergies and prevent asthma attacks. 8. The most common medicines used to treat asthma are inhaled corticosteroids. These medicines are usually the first choice for people with persistent asthma. They help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. 9. Leukotriene modifiers are another type of control medicine. They work by reducing inflammation in the lungs.

"1. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have published updated recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 2. The treatment of RA has changed dramatically over the past decade with the introduction of several new medications that have improved outcomes for patients with RA. 3. The treatment of RA is now guided by the presence or absence of RA factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, the duration of symptoms, the presence of bone erosions on joint radiographs, and the presence of any comorbid conditions. 4. Patients with RA factor and/or anti-CCP antibodies and bone erosions on joint radiographs should be treated aggressively with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 5. Methotrexate is the DMARD of first choice. 6. Combination DMARD therapy (methotrexate + sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine) is more effective than methotrexate monotherapy and is also more effective than leflunomide. 7. Anti-TNF therapy (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab) is more effective than methotrexate monotherapy in patients with active RA. 8. The combination of methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is more effective than methotrexate monotherapy and is the combination of first choice in patients with active RA. 9. Anakinra, 100 mg/day, is less effective than anti-TNF therapy. 10. Glucocorticoids should be used as bridges to better disease control with DMARDs. 11. The ACR and EULAR recommend that treatment with a DMARD or an anti-TNF drug should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made. 12.

The introduction of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents has revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 2. Anti-TNF therapy has been shown in clinical trials to reduce disease activity, slow radiographic progression of joint destruction, and improve functional status. 3. Anti-TNF therapy has also been shown in observational studies to reduce the need for joint surgery. 4. Despite the success of anti-TNF therapy, only a minority of patients will respond to this treatment. 5. Recent research has focused on identifying predictors of response and non-responders to anti-TNF therapy. 6. Other biological agents, such as the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, have shown promising results in clinical trials for patients with RA. 7. The safety of biological agents in the treatment of RA is an ongoing area of investigation.","1. Methotrexate is the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for most patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 2. Combination therapy with methotrexate plus another DMARD (such as leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or cyclosporine) is often used if methotrexate alone is not effective. 3. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (such as infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab) are often used in patients who do not respond to methotrexate. 4. Other biological agents (such as anakinra or abatacept) are used in patients who do not respond to the anti-TNF agents. 5. Glucocorticoids are used in patients with severe disease or as bridges to DMARD therapy. 6.

"1. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors of the adrenal glands and nerves near the adrenal glands, respectively. 2. The tumors are usually benign and affect the sympathetic nervous system. 3. They can be caused by inherited gene mutations or they can develop sporadically. 4. Gene mutations are usually inherited from a parent. 5. In vitro fertilization does not prevent offspring from inheriting genetic material from the parents. 6. If the gene for pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma is known in your family, it is possible to be tested for this gene mutation. If you or your partner carry this mutation, you can have IVF with preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This involves testing the embryos for the gene mutation and only transferring embryos that do not have the mutation.","1.

IVF would reduce the risk of passing it on to your kids because the embryos would not be exposed to the mutated gene.","1. Yes, it is possible to avoid passing it on to your future offspring.2. IVF is one of the options to achieve this.3. Other options include:a. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).b. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS).4. PGD and PGS are techniques for detecting genetic abnormalities in an embryo prior to implantation, so that only those embryos lacking the genetic abnormalities can be selected for transfer during IVF.5. In PGD, a single cell is removed from the embryo on day 3 or 5 following fertilization. The cell is then analyzed for genetic abnormalities.6. In PGS, the genetic status of the embryo is determined by analyzing the genetic material of the father's sperm.7. In both cases, only those embryos lacking the genetic abnormalities are selected for transfer during IVF.8. If your girlfriend's family has a history of Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma, which only her brother and father have, and you don't have it, then you can go for IVF to avoid passing it on to your future offspring.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization is a good option to prevent the condition from being passed on. 2. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are usually caused by a mutation in a gene called RET. 3. If your girlfriend is a carrier of the RET mutation, then you have a 50% chance of having a child with the condition. 4. In vitro fertilization can prevent the condition from being passed on because the egg and sperm are not combined, but rather fertilized outside the body. 5. This means that any genetic abnormalities can be detected and the embryo can be selected for implantation. 6. It is important to note that in vitro fertilization is not 100% effective at preventing genetic conditions, but it does significantly reduce the risk.","1. Yes, IVF can help minimize the risk of your child inheriting Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma. 2. IVF involves fertilization of egg outside the body and transfer of the fertilized egg into the uterus. 3. During IVF, the egg is taken from the ovary and the sperm is inserted into the egg. 4. The fertilized egg is then transferred into the uterus of the woman who carried the egg. 5. The fertilized egg has genetic material from the woman who carried the egg and the man whose sperm was used. 6. In your case, since your girlfriend is a carrier, the egg used for IVF can be from another woman (donor) and the sperm can be from your boyfriend. 7. This will ensure that the child will not inherit Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma from your girlfriend. 8. The child will inherit genetic material from the donor and your boyfriend. 9. The donor and your boyfriend should be screened for any potential genetic disorders before proceeding with IVF. 10. It is important to note that IVF is expensive and may not be covered by insurance. 11. You should discuss the financial implications of IVF with your girlfriend and your healthcare provider."

"1. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a condition in which your body does not produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. 2. Type 1 diabetes is usually the result of an autoimmune process in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The exact cause of the attack is not known. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults. It used to be referred to as juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes. 3. Although type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, it is most common in children. Symptoms usually develop suddenly. 4. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop from a lack of insulin. Insulin is needed to help glucose get into your cells. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. 5. With type 1 diabetes, your body still produces insulin. However, your body does not make enough insulin. Or, your body may not be able to use the insulin it makes. This condition is called insulin resistance.","2 main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or early adulthood.

The exact cause of type 1 diabetes isn't known. It's a complex disease that results from the interaction of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. 2. The underlying problem is an inherited tendency to destroy the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This causes a deficiency of insulin, which is needed to allow glucose to enter the cells of the body. Without insulin, too much glucose remains in the blood. 3. The beta cells are destroyed by an immune attack. In people who develop type 1 diabetes, the immune system begins to attack the beta cells in the pancreas. The cause of this attack isn't known.","1.

With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  NIH: National Eye Institute","1. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 3. There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are open-angle and closed-angle. 4. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma in the United States. It is chronic and usually develops slowly over time. 5. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. It occurs in people who have narrow angles in the eye where the iris meets the cornea. 6. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower the pressure in the eye. This can be done with medicines, laser treatments, or surgery. 7. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. 8. It is important to get regular eye exams to help diagnose glaucoma early when it is easier to treat.","1.

With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. 2. Open-angle glaucoma is a chronic disease that causes damage to the optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. If it is not treated, open-angle glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss. 3. In the United States, open-angle glaucoma affects about 2 million people. It occurs in about 10 percent of people over age 60, and about 25 percent of those over age 80. 4. Other risk factors include  - being African American  - having a family history of glaucoma  - having diabetes  - being very nearsighted or farsighted  - having high blood pressure  - being older than 60. 5. With open-angle glaucoma, there is no immediate pain or discomfort. Vision loss usually begins with the outer edges of the field of vision. This means that the side or corners of the eyes are affected first. If the condition is not treated, the vision loss can spread to the center of the visual field. 6. Open-angle glaucoma is treated with eyedrops, pills, or laser surgery. The goal of treatment is to lower the pressure inside the eye. Lowering eye pressure can help prevent vision loss.","1) Glaucoma is a group of diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve and vision loss.

"1. You can get a genetic test done only if you have a family history of the same disease or if you have symptoms of the disease.2. The genetic test is done by taking a blood sample or a saliva sample.3. The test will look for the defective gene in the body.4. The test result will tell you if you have the defective gene.5. If you have the defective gene, you may be at risk of getting the disease.6. You can talk to your doctor about getting a genetic test done.","Yes, there are genetic tests available that can detect mutations in specific genes known to be associated with certain illnesses. These are called diagnostic genetic tests. However, there are also genetic tests available that can detect mutations in many different genes at one time - these are called diagnostic whole exome or whole genome tests. These tests can be used to evaluate someone who has an unknown or unexplained genetic condition. They can also be used to evaluate someone who has a known genetic condition, but wants to know if they carry any other mutations that might affect their health.","Yes, genetic testing can be used to detect genetic mutations associated with certain conditions even before a diagnosis is made.  However, it is important to note that not all genetic mutations can be detected through genetic testing, and some genetic mutations may not cause any symptoms or health problems.  Therefore, genetic testing should only be conducted under the guidance of a healthcare provider who can help interpret test results and determine if any further testing or treatment is needed.","Yes, it is possible to undergo genetic testing to identify a mutation without knowing the underlying illness. This type of testing is called diagnostic genetic testing. It is used to identify a genetic mutation known to cause or increase the risk for a specific disorder. Diagnostic genetic testing can be used even when symptoms have not yet appeared or have not yet been diagnosed.","1. Yes, there are genetic tests that can detect mutations without requiring a specific diagnosis. These tests are known as 'diagnostic' or 'predictive' genetic tests. 2. The test can be done on a blood sample or a buccal swab. 3. The test can detect mutations in all genes or only specific genes. 4. The test can be done during the pre-conception stage or after the baby is born. 5. The test can be done for adult-onset diseases or for diseases that manifest in childhood. 6. The test can be done for diseases that have a late-onset or for diseases that have an early onset. 7. The test can be done for diseases that have an unknown inheritance pattern or for diseases that are inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. 8. The test can be done for diseases that are X-linked or diseases that are Y-linked. 9. The test can be done for chromosomal abnormalities.","Yes, genetic testing can identify mutations that cause certain genetic conditions, even if the specific disease the mutation causes has not yet been diagnosed.  For example, a genetic condition called Marfan syndrome has been linked to more than 100 different mutations in the FBN1 gene, which codes for a protein called fibrillin.  People with Marfan syndrome have a mutation in the FBN1 gene, but the condition itself was not identified until the 19th century.  Similarly, Huntington disease, which was first described in 1872, has been linked to more than 100 different mutations in the HTT gene.  So, even though these conditions were not identified until many years after the mutations causing them were present, genetic testing can detect the mutations."

4 stages of congestive heart failure: 1. Stage A: Patients who are at high risk of developing heart failure but do not have heart failure symptoms. 2. Stage B: Patients who have developed heart failure but do not have symptoms of poor circulation. 3. Stage C: Patients with current or prior symptoms of poor circulation. 4. Stage D: Patients with symptoms of end-stage heart failure.,"1. People with congestive heart failure and stage 4 kidney disease are at high risk for complications such as: 2. Heart failure can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs, which can cause shortness of breath, coughing, and trouble breathing. 3. The buildup of fluid in the lungs can also make it harder to breathe. 4. Fluid buildup in the lungs can cause low oxygen levels in the blood, which can lead to: a. Confusion b. Weakness c. Fainting d. Seizures 5. Fluid buildup in the lungs can also cause chest pain and rapid heartbeat. 6. Kidney failure can lead to anemia, bone pain, muscle cramps, and confusion. 7. Anemia can make you feel tired and weak. 8. Bone pain and muscle cramps are often caused by too much acid in the blood. 9. Confusion can occur if the levels of waste products in your body become too high. 10. If you have heart failure and stage 4 kidney disease, you will need to work closely with your health care provider to manage your symptoms. 11. You may need to take medicines to help your heart and kidneys work properly. 12. You may also need to limit salt and fluids in your diet. 13. Your health care provider may recommend a special diet with fewer calories and less fat. 14. You may need to take medicines to help control your blood pressure and heart rate. 15.

If you have kidney failure, you may need dialysis, a procedure in which excess fluid and waste products are removed from your body. 20.",1. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. CHF is caused by a problem with the heart's structure or function. It is the end result of any form of chronic heart disease. 2. Kidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to remove wastes and perform other functions. 3. Kidney failure is usually divided into 5 stages. Stage 4 means that the kidneys are at a critical point of failing. 4. People with stage 4 kidney failure have fewer than 15% of the kidney functioning units (nephrons) working. This means that less than 15% of the kidneys are working properly. 5.

Stage 4 chronic kidney disease is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease. People with this condition have very serious kidney damage and are at risk for seizures, coma, and death.  People with congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease should receive treatment for both conditions. Treatment may include medications, dietary changes, and lifestyle changes. People with congestive heart failure may need to limit salt and water intake. People with chronic kidney disease may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.","1. When congestive heart failure occurs, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. As a result, fluid backs up into the lungs and causes problems such as:  - Shortness of breath  - Coughing  - Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)  - Fatigue  - Weakness  - Confusion  - Chest pain 2. The body also holds on to too much sodium and water, causing swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, feet, and/or abdomen. 3. When kidneys are in stage 4 of chronic kidney disease, they are in end-stage renal disease (ESD). This means that they are no longer working well. A person with ESD may:  - Have symptoms of kidney failure, such as swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, and/or abdomen  - Need dialysis or a kidney transplant  - Have symptoms of heart failure  - Have symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness and weakness  - Have symptoms of bone disease, such as bone pain and broken bones  - Have symptoms of nerve damage, such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet  - Have symptoms of mental changes, such as confusion and memory loss  - Have symptoms of sleep problems, such as insomnia and restlessness  - Have symptoms of skin problems, such as itching and easy bruising  - Have symptoms of gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss  - Have symptoms of sexual dysfunction  - Have symptoms of bleeding problems, such as easy bruising and nosebleeds  - Have symptoms of dry mouth  - Have symptoms of muscle cramps and twitching  - Have symptoms of seizures  - Have symptoms of coma  - Have symptoms of heart attack  - Have symptoms of stroke  - Have symptoms of congestive heart failure, such as shortness of breath and coughing  - Have symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness and weakness  - Have symptoms of bone disease, such as bone pain and broken bones  - Have symptoms of","1.

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb bicarbonate (HCO3), which is a key component of the body's acid-base balance. As a result, bicarbonate is lost in the urine, and the body becomes more acidic. 3. The disorder is one of several forms of acidosis. 4. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a genetic disorder that can be inherited. It is caused by defects in the genes that control the function of the kidneys. It can also be caused by autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, and by certain medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 5. The disorder can occur at any age, but it is most common in children. It affects males and females equally. 6. Symptoms vary from person to person. They may include tiredness, weakness, and a feeling of malaise. The disorder can lead to growth problems in children. 7. In adults, the disorder can cause kidney stones and/or kidney damage. 8. Diagnosis is based on blood and urine tests and other diagnostic procedures, such as a kidney biopsy. 9. Treatment varies depending on the severity of the disorder and may include medications to help correct the acid-base balance. People with the disorder should talk to their health care provider about receiving vaccinations for diseases that can be prevented by vaccination. 10. People with distal renal tubular acidosis should avoid taking certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, that can worsen the condition. 11. The disorder can be managed with lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and regular exercise. 12. People with distal renal tubular acidosis have a higher risk of developing certain types of kidney stones.","I'm sorry, but I can't recommend any specific associations or organizations for Distal renal tubular acidosis.  However, I can provide some general information.  Distal renal tubular acidosis is a condition in which the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine.  As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis).  The kidneys normally work to keep the body at a healthy pH by removing excess acid and keeping the amount of acid in the blood at a normal level.  In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are not doing their job properly.  The condition can be caused by an inherited problem or by a problem with the kidneys caused by another disease.  In some cases, the condition is caused by the use of certain medications.  The symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis can vary from person to person, but may include:  - Weak bones  - Poor growth  - Abnormal heart rhythms  - Fatigue  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Abnormal blood electrolyte levels  - High levels of potassium or chloride in the blood  - Low levels of calcium or phosphorus in the blood  - High levels of acid in the blood  - High blood pressure  - The condition is diagnosed with blood and urine tests.  Treatment depends on the cause of the condition.  In some cases, treatment may include taking potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate.  In other cases, treatment may include stopping medications that are causing the problem.  A low-salt diet may also be recommended.  If the condition is caused by a problem with the kidneys, treatment may include dialysis.  A low-protein diet may also be recommended.  People with distal renal tubular acidosis should talk to their health care provider about eating a balanced diet and getting enough vitamins and minerals.  Proper nutrition can help reduce the risk of bone fractures and other complications.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder of the kidneys that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The most common type of dRTA occurs when the kidneys do not properly absorb bicarbonate (HCO3), the base that helps neutralize acid in the blood. 3. Other types of dRTA occur when the kidneys do not properly remove hydrogen ions (H+) from the blood, or when the kidneys do not make adequate amounts of bicarbonate. 4. dRTA is a chronic condition. Symptoms may come and go, or be mild. 5. If left untreated, dRTA can lead to kidney stones, bone pain, and growth problems in children. 6. dRTA can occur at any age, but is most common in children.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. 2. The kidneys normally remove wastes and excess acid from the blood by filtering them from the blood into the urine. 3. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not remove enough acid from the blood. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 4. There are two types of distal renal tubular acidosis: type 1 and type 2. 5. Type 1 is the most common type of distal renal tubular acidosis. 6. Type 2 is rare and occurs mainly in children. 7. This condition is caused by a problem with a protein in the kidney called CA-2. 8. The CA-2 protein helps the kidneys remove acid from the blood. 9. People with distal renal tubular acidosis may not have any symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include: 10. * Nausea or vomiting 11. * Weakness 12. * Fatigue 13. * Belching or flatulence (gas) 14. * Anxiety or nervousness 15. * Irritability 16. * Difficulty concentrating 17. * Muscle pain or cramping 18. * Shortness of breath 19. * Chest pain 20. * Heartburn 21. * Feeling cold 22. * Feeling tired 23. * Headache 24. * Increased urine output 25. * Increased thirst 26. * Muscle weakness 27. * Weight loss 28. * Dry mouth 29. * Narrowing of the space between the vertebrae (which can be seen on an x-ray) 30. * Kidney stones 31. * Osteomalacia (softening and weakening of the bones) 32. * Osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) 33. * Osteopenia (decreased bone density) 3","1.

Type 1 dRTA occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove hydrogen ions from the blood into the urine. This means that too many hydrogen ions are left in the blood. 3. Type 2 distal renal tubular acidosis is very rare. It occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove calcium and/or magnesium from the blood into the urine. 4. Type 4 distal renal tubular acidosis is also very rare. It occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove bicarbonate (HCO3) from the blood into the urine. 5. Causes of dRTA include autoimmune disorders, such as Sjogren's syndrome and lupus; inherited conditions, such as Bartter syndrome; and certain medications, such as amphotericin B, ifosfamide, and acetazolamide. 6. Symptoms of dRTA are mainly related to the acidosis and include: fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst and urination, and slow growth in children. 7. The diagnosis of dRTA is based on a careful medical history and physical exam, blood tests to measure the levels of electrolytes and other chemicals in the blood, and urine tests to measure the levels of electrolytes and other substances in the urine. 8. Treatment of dRTA involves taking medications to replace any missing electrolytes and increasing the amount of bicarbonate in the diet.","1) Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine.
