"1. Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of severe headache, which often is associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and harmless visual disturbances. 2. There are several types of migraine. The two most common types are migraine without aura and migraine with aura. Aura can include visual disturbances. 3. The goal of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. 4. Treatments include medications, alternative therapies, and preventive measures. 5. Medications include triptans, ergotamine, and analgesics. Triptans are the most effective medications for migraine. They act by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain. Triptans are available as oral, nasal sprays, and injections. Ergotamine is available as a nasal spray. Analgesics such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), aspirin, and paracetamol (Tylenol) are effective in treating mild to moderate migraine. 6. Alternative therapies include supplements, such as feverfew and magnesium, and acupuncture. 7. Preventive medications include antidepressants, beta blockers, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers, and botulinum toxin. Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Sinequan), and protriptyline (Vivactil), are effective in preventing migraine attacks. Beta blockers, such as propranolol (Inderal), are also effective in preventing migraine attacks. Anticonvulsants, such as valproate (Depakote), are also effective in preventing migraine attacks. 8. The goal of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. 9. Treatments include medications, alternative therapies, and preventive measures. 10. Medications include triptans, ergotamine, and analgesics. Triptans are the most effective medications for migraine. They act by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain","1. Yes, there are studies that have investigated which migraine treatments are most effective for specific migraine conditions. 2. For example, studies have found that triptans are most effective for migraine with aura, while ergotamine is most effective for migraine headache. Additionally, triptans have been found to be most effective for migraine headache with moderate to severe intensity.","Yes. The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (2nd ed.) identifies the following treatment approaches that have been found to be effective in the management of migraine:

Education:

- Provide the patient with information on the disorder, its probable causes, and its treatment.
- Include information on ways to control the disorder and how to recognize and report adverse reactions of medications.
- Explain the importance of maintaining full functionality and the ways in which physical therapy can help achieve this goal.

Behavioral Medicine:

- Help the patient identify stressors in his or her life and assist in problem-solving techniques.
- Teach the patient relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, and breathing exercises to help control stress.

Pharmacological agents:

- Medication is the most common treatment for migraine.
- Over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin are often used as initial treatment for mild to moderate pain.
- Prescription medications, such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are used for moderate to severe pain.
- Triptans are a class of medications that are effective in treating acute migraine.

Electrotherapy:

- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been found to be effective in the treatment of migraine.

Therapeutic exercise:

- A graded exercise program has been found to be effective in decreasing the frequency of migraine attacks.

Manual therapy:

- Soft tissue manipulation has been found to be effective in decreasing the frequency of migraine attacks.

Answer: Yes","1) The pathophysiology of migraine is not completely understood, but it is known that migraine is not due to vascular headache, and that migraine aura is due to a focal neurologic event. 2) There are two major forms of migraine, migraine without aura and migraine with aura. 3) Migraine with aura is thought to be due to a sterile perivascular inflammation that leads to neurologic symptoms before headache onset. 4) The pathophysiology of migraine without aura is not as well understood as migraine with aura, but it is thought to involve a neurogenic mechanism. 5) The triptans are the most effective class of drugs for the treatment of acute migraine. 6) The triptans work by acting on 5-HT1B/1D receptors, which results in constriction of the aeriovenous shunt of the carotid aery and inhibition of neurotransmitter release. 7) Triptans have been shown to be effective in migraine with aura as well as migraine without aura. 8) Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are nonselective serotonin receptor agonists that are also effective in the treatment of acute migraine. 9) The mechanism of action of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine is similar to that of the triptans. 10) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used for the treatment of migraine. 11) NSAIDs are thought to work in migraine by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. 12) Prophylactic treatment of migraine is often necessary when the frequency of attacks is high (more than two per month). 13) Prophylactic treatments for migraine include anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and calcium channel blockers. 14) Anticonvulsants, such as valproate and topiramate, are thought to work in migraine by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. 15) Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and noriptyline, are thought","1. Yes, there are studies that have attempted to categorize migraine treatments by their effectiveness against specific migraine subtypes. 2. One such study evaluated the efficacy of different migraine treatments in patients with migraine with aura, migraine without aura, and basilar migraine. This study found that ergotamine and propranolol were effective in all three types of migraine, while sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine were effective in migraine with aura and migraine without aura, but not basilar migraine. This study also found that no treatments were consistently effective in preventing all migraine attacks.","1) Yes, there is scientific evidence that links specific migraine treatments to their effectiveness against distinct migraine conditions. 2) The scientific evidence is strongest for preventive medications (e.g., beta blockers, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers) and triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, naratriptan). 3) The evidence is more limited for other migraine treatments (e.g., ergotamine, opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and supplements). 4) The evidence is weakest for placebo treatments and other unproven therapies (e.g., feverfew, magnesium, homeopathy, acupuncture)."

Pyridoxine is used to treat or prevent low blood sugar, anemia, and convulsions. 7. Pyridoxine is also used to prevent and treat a lack of vitamin B6. 8. Pyridoxine is used to prevent and treat a lack of vitamin B6.","1. Pyridoxine is a water-soluble vitamin that is widely distributed in foods. Although excessive intake of pyridoxine may cause peripheral neuropathy, there is no evidence that it is teratogenic. 2. Pyridoxine is a component of some multivitamin preparations. Multivitamin therapy for pregnant women has been reported to increase the incidence of birth defects in general, and oral facial defects specifically. However, this association may be related to the vitamin content of the specific multivitamin product rather than to pyridoxine. 3. Because of the reported association between multivitamin preparations and oral facial defects, and the lack of evidence that pyridoxine is teratogenic, it is prudent to avoid vitamin supplements during pregnancy unless a specific nutritional deficiency is documented."

"Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that involves a loss of thinking and reasoning skills. It is one of the most common forms of dementia. Lewy body dementia is caused by abnormal protein deposits in the brain. These deposits are called Lewy bodies.  Lewy bodies are found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia. But they are also found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.  Lewy body dementia is usually characterized by:  - Problems with thinking and reasoning  - Changes in attention and alertness  - Hallucinations  - Muscle stiffness  - Repeated falls  - Sleep problems  - Delusions or paranoia  - Depression  - Loss of ability to move  - Problems with talking and understanding speech  - Lack of motivation  - Lack of emotion  - Other symptoms  Lewy body dementia is most often first noticed by close family members or caregivers. It is often hard to recognize in its early stages.  Lewy body dementia can be difficult to diagnose. There is no single test to confirm the diagnosis. Instead, diagnosis is based on a pattern of symptoms. It is often diagnosed through a process of elimination, by ruling out other types of dementia.  Lewy body dementia can be managed, but not cured. Drugs can help manage some of the symptoms. Treatment also involves providing supportive care. This includes helping people with everyday tasks, such as bathing and dressing, and helping to prevent them from getting lost.  Lewy body dementia usually leads to death within 3 to 6 years after diagnosis.

They may also have tremors and movement problems like those found in Parkinson's disease.  Lewy body dementia is caused by the buildup of abnormal structures in the brain called Lewy bodies. The disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85. Lewy body dementia may be difficult to diagnose because symptoms are similar to other types of dementia. There is no cure for Lewy body dementia. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms. People with Lewy body dementia often respond better to medications used in Alzheimer's disease than medications used in Parkinson's disease.,"1. Lewy body dementia is the 2nd most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. 2. It affects more than 1 million Americans currently and is estimated to affect up to 1-1.5 million by 2050. 3.

"1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These three genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together as a complex. This complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many kinds of food, especially protein-rich foods such as milk and meat.

2. The technical and simple language of MSUD is the same: it is a group of inherited disorders that affect the breakdown of certain amino acids in the body, causing physical and mental problems. Babies with MSUD cannot process the essential nutrient called protein, which is found in most foods.

Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together to process the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Mutations in any of these genes can prevent these proteins from working normally. 2. Early diagnosis and withdrawal of the offending protein (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) from the diet can prevent brain damage and other complications. Treatment may also include prescription of thiamine and other vitamins, as well as supplements of high-calorie foods and fluids. 3. The long-term prognosis for patients with maple syrup urine disease depends on the severity of the disorder and the promptness of diagnosis and treatment. Patients who are treated early may not have intellectual disability or other complications. However, patients who are not treated early may have intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other complications.","2 mutations in the BCKDH gene cause maple syrup urine disease. BCKDH gene mutations prevent the production of the enzyme branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, which is needed to break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine in the body. Without this enzyme, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body, causing the symptoms of maple syrup urine disease.","1. The metabolic disorder of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is due to a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex, which is necessary for the degradation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. 2. The BCKAD complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix. It is composed of 5 proteins and 5 cofactors. 3. The genetic mutations that cause MSUD affect the genes encoding the enzymes and cofactors that compose the BCKAD complex. 4. Mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes of the BCKAD complex cause decreased enzyme activity, which results in the accumulation of BCAAs and their toxic byproducts (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. 5. The accumulation of these metabolites leads to neurological problems, such as mental retardation, as well as physical symptoms, such as feeding problems, vomiting, hypoglycemia, and acidosis. 6. The treatment for MSUD is dietary management, which involves restricting the intake of BCAAs.","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. 2.

"1. A bone marrow transplant may be a cure for thalassemia major. Bone marrow transplant involves taking out the bone marrow from a donor (a healthy person) and putting it into the patient. This is a very complicated procedure and has serious side effects. It is only recommended if a patient has a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match donor. 2. Stem cell transplant is another option. Stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types of blood cells. Stem cell transplants are similar to bone marrow transplants, but the stem cells are given through a vein rather than being taken from the bone marrow. 3. Umbilical cord blood transplants. The umbilical cord contains high concentrations of stem cells. These can be used for transplants. But this is still considered experimental and is not yet widely available. 4. Gene therapy is also experimental. It involves inserting a gene that can correct the thalassemia into the patient's stem cells. The stem cells are then transplanted into the patient. 5.

"1. Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by progressive damage to the nervous system. It affects about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States. 2. The disease is caused by a defect in a gene on chromosome 9 that codes for a protein called frataxin. 3. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the FXN gene must be affected for a person to be affected. 4. The most common age of onset is between 2 and 25 years old. 5. Symptoms include: Loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) Problems with speech and swallowing Difficulty with eye movements Delayed development of motor skills, such as walking and sitting Problems with the heart and diabetes 6. No specific treatment exists for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment is directed at the specific symptoms that are present. 7. Researchers are working on a number of possible treatments for Friedreich ataxia. 8. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, and creatine are being studied as possible treatments for Friedreich ataxia. 9. Friedreich ataxia is a fatal condition. 10. Average life expectancy is 35 years following diagnosis.","1. Friedreich ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. 2. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. 3. Medical management is directed toward the specific symptoms and problems of each individual. 4. Friedreich ataxia is caused by an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) on chromosome 9q13. 5. The treatment strategy is to replace the mutant frataxin gene by gene replacement therapy or to upregulate the residual gene by pharmacological agents. 6. A number of clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches.","1. Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system and other tissues. It usually begins in childhood and leads to difficulties with balance and coordination. Muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) occur over time. Speech problems and impaired sensation may also occur.2. Symptoms typically worsen over time, leading to increasing difficulty with everyday activities. Most people with this condition require use of a wheelchair by their early 20s.3. Friedreich ataxia is caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) on chromosome 9q13. The GAA expansion results in decreased production of the frataxin protein, which is necessary for normal development and function of the nervous system.4. Treatment is supportive. Orthopedic problems are common and may require surgery. Physical therapy may help maintain function. Speech therapy may help with communication. A high-fiber diet may help prevent constipation.5. Researchers are studying a number of approaches to treat this condition, including antioxidants (such as coenzyme Q10 and idebenone), anti-inflammatory agents (such as glucocorticoids), and neuroprotective agents (such as minocycline).6. Friedreich ataxia is genetic disorder that results from an abnormal gene. It is caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN) on chromosome 9q13. The GAA expansion results in decreased production of the frataxin protein, which is necessary for normal development and function of the nervous system.7. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both copies of the FXN gene must be affected for a person to be affected with this disorder.8. In most cases, people with Friedreich ataxia inherit two abnormal copies of the FXN gene from their parents.9. Friedreich ataxia is most often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms usually appear before age 25.","1. What is Friedreich ataxia?  Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes movement problems. It is caused by a problem with a gene that makes a protein called frataxin. The gene problem is in an area of the gene called intron. The frataxin protein is needed to make nerves work properly. 2. What causes Friedreich ataxia?  The gene that makes frataxin is on chromosome 9. If the gene has extra sections in it, the gene doesn't work as well. This happens in Friedreich ataxia. The extra sections are called ""repeats."" People with Friedreich ataxia have 1000 or more repeats in the gene. People who don't have Friedreich ataxia have 7-200 repeats. 3. What are the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia?  Symptoms usually begin in childhood. They include:  - Loss of muscle strength and coordination (ataxia). This makes it hard to walk, run, and do other activities.  - Problems with speech and swallowing.  - Loss of sensation in the feet and hands (peripheral neuropathy).  - Heart problems. The heart may have problems with its electrical system. This can lead to a slow or irregular heartbeat. The heart may also weaken and fail.  - Diabetes.  - Curvature of the spine.  - Dementia.  - Muscle weakness.  - Loss of reflexes.  - Eye problems.  - Problems with hearing.  - Swollen tissue (lymphedema) in the hands and feet.  - Rarely, a curved spine. 4. How is Friedreich ataxia diagnosed?  The doctor will do a physical exam and ask about the family history. The doctor will also do tests that measure the electrical activity in the heart (electrocardiogram or ECG). There is no specific test to diagnose Friedreich ataxia. The doctor may do a test called a glucose tolerance test to check for diabetes. The doctor may also do a test called a nerve conduction study to check for nerve damage. 5. What","1. Friedreich ataxia is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the nerves. It is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene, which results in a deficiency of the frataxin protein.  2. Friedreich ataxia is most often inherited from a person's parents. Only one copy of the FXN gene is needed to cause this disease. Most people with Friedreich ataxia inherit the disease from one affected parent.  3. Friedreich ataxia is a rare condition. It affects about 1 in 50,000 people in the United States.  4. Friedreich ataxia symptoms usually appear in childhood or adolescence. The first symptom is usually clumsy movement. Other symptoms include:  - Difficulty walking  - Loss of muscle strength  - Speech problems  - Loss of sensation  - Heart problems (most common cause of death)  - Diabetes  - Swallowing problems  - Muscle pain  - Muscle stiffness  - Curvature of the spine  - Loss of reflexes  - High blood pressure  - Dementia 5. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich ataxia. Research is being done to find ways to treat the symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.  6. Friedreich ataxia is managed with supportive treatment, including:  - Physical therapy  - Speech therapy  - Eyeglasses or contact lenses  - Surgery to correct foot deformities and scoliosis  - Treatment for diabetes and high blood pressure  - Treatment for heart disease  - Gene therapy 7. People with Friedreich ataxia usually need wheelchairs at about age 40. Average life expectancy is about 35 years.","1. I am sorry to hear about your condition. Friedreich ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which results in decreased frataxin production. 2. At present, there is no curative treatment for Friedreich ataxia. However, some of the symptoms can be treated. For example, those with diabetes can be treated with insulin, and those with cardiac problems can be treated with standard cardiac medications. 3. There are several clinical trials ongoing for Friedreich ataxia. You can search for them at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home. 4. The most promising treatment for Friedreich ataxia is idebenone, which is a synthetic analog of the cardiotonic agent, the digitalis plant. This agent has been shown to increase frataxin levels in cell lines derived from patients with Friedreich ataxia. A phase 3 clinical trial is currently underway to determine if idebenone can improve cardiac function in Friedreich ataxia patients. 5. I hope this helps."

"1. Menkes disease is a disorder of copper metabolism that is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a protein that is needed to transport copper in the bloodstream. 2. This protein is needed for the normal development of nerve cells in the brain. 3. Menkes disease is characterized by mental retardation, impaired physical development, and kinky hair. 4. The disease affects boys and girls. 5. Menkes disease is also called kinky hair syndrome or steely hair disease. 6. The disease is characterized by mental retardation, impaired physical development, and kinky hair. 7. Menkes disease is caused by mutations in the MNK gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in transporting copper in the bloodstream. 8. Copper is a mineral that is needed for the normal development and functioning of the body. Copper plays a role in iron metabolism, the making of connective tissue, the nervous system, and the digestive system. 9. Too little copper can lead to a disorder called Menkes disease. 10. The protein made by the MNK gene is needed for the normal transport of copper in the bloodstream. People with Menkes disease have low levels of copper in their blood. 11. Mutations in the MNK gene prevent the protein from working properly. As a result, people with Menkes disease have difficulty getting copper from the food they eat into the bloodstream. 12. Without enough copper, children with Menkes disease cannot develop properly. They are prone to frequent and serious infections because their immune systems are weak. 13. Menkes disease is usually diagnosed in infants, often before age 2. The disease can be detected in the womb or during routine screening tests that are performed when the baby is about 30 days old. 14. Treatment is aimed at providing extra copper or the copper that the body needs.

"1. The Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). 2. It is an inherited condition that is passed down through families (inherited). 3. It is usually first noticed in infants and young children. 4. It is caused by problems in a gene called LMNA. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. This protein plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the outer membrane of cells, including cells in the retina. 5. There is no cure for Leber congenital amaurosis. Treatment focuses on managing vision loss. 6. The prognosis varies. Some people have severe vision loss that cannot be corrected. Others have milder forms of the condition and can benefit from corrective lenses or low vision aids. 7. People with this condition may also have other vision problems, including: Nearsightedness (myopia). This is the most common vision problem. It occurs when the cornea (the clear covering of the eye) is too curved or the eye is too long. This causes light to focus in front of the retina, instead of directly on it. Farsightedness (hyperopia). This is when the cornea is too flat or the eye is too short. This causes light to focus behind the retina, instead of directly on it. Astigmatism. This is when the cornea is irregularly shaped. This causes light to be focused on two points on the retina instead of one. 8. People with this condition may also have problems with their vision that cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. These problems may include: Narrowing of the pupil (pinpoint pupil). This makes the pupil much smaller than normal, which can cause problems with vision in dim light. This pupil problem is called constricted pupil. Total color blindness (achromatopsia). This means that a person cannot distinguish certain colors. This is caused by problems with the cones, the specialized cells in the retina that detect color. Night blindness (nyctalopia). This means that a person has trouble seeing at night or in poor lighting. It is caused by problems with the rods, the",1. Contact a genetic counselor or a doctor who specializes in genetic disorders.

Poor vision that is present from birth (congenital) and does not improve with glasses or contact lenses. 5. Problems with night vision and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). 6. An abnormal appearance of the retina (retinal pigmentation) that is seen by an eye exam using an ophthalmoscope. 7. The exact features of the disease vary from person to person, depending on which gene is affected and how much of the retina is affected. 8. In some cases, the disease also affects the central nervous system, causing mental and developmental delays. 9. Leber congenital amaurosis cannot be cured, but some of the vision problems can be helped by wearing sunglasses to reduce sensitivity to light, by using large print books and other items, and by getting special help in school.","1. Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 2. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells and other cell types. It is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are then processed by the optic nerve and brain to produce a visual image. 3. Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 4. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. Other features of this disorder include abnormalities in the electrical responses of the retina, delayed development of vision, and a loss of peripheral vision (tunnel vision) as the child grows older. 5. Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in one of several genes (LCA, RPE65, CRX, CEP290, and MERTK) that are essential for normal vision. 6. Most cases are due to mutations in the LCA gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called rhodopsin kinase. This protein is involved in the processing of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. 7. Mutations in this gene prevent the production of functional rhodopsin kinase protein, which leads to the abnormal development and function of photoreceptor cells. As a result, the photoreceptor cells cannot effectively convert light into electrical signals, which leads to severe visual impairment. 8. In a few cases, mutations in the RPE65 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the normal function of photoreceptor cells, are responsible for this disorder. 9. Mutations in the RPE65 gene prevent the production of functional RPE65 protein, which leads to the abnormal development and function of photoreceptor cells.

Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 3. People with this disorder are born with severe visual impairment. Infants may be able to see only bright light, while older children may be able to see only shadows. 4. The visual impairment is usually stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. Other features of this disorder include abnormalities in the electrical activity of the retina (retinal electrophysiology), a loss of nerve fibers in the retina, and extra eye fibers. 5. The condition is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. 6. Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in one of several genes that encode proteins involved in the development of photoreceptor cells. 7. There is no cure for this disorder. However, people with Leber congenital amaurosis can use a variety of visual aids, including eyeglasses, contact lenses, and specialized low-vision devices. 8. People with this disorder may also benefit from gene replacement therapy, which involves inserting the normal copy of a gene into the cells of people with the disorder. 9.

Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in any one of several genes that control the function of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. 4. Because the disorder is inherited, it will affect the vision of family members. 5. The Leber congenital amaurosis gene is passed down in families, so it is important to know whether family members have the condition. 6.

"1. Cardiomyopathy is disease of heart muscle. It may be due to genetic or acquired causes. 2. Cardiomyopathy is broadly classified into two groups: a. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by enlarged left ventricle chamber of the heart. It is due to genetic (familial, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive) or acquired (alcohol, cocaine, chemotherapeutic agents, metabolic disorders like diabetes, thyroid disorders, hormonal imbalance, post pregnancy, viral infections, autoimmune disorders, radiation, myocarditis) causes. b. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by thickened ventricle walls. It is usually hereditary (autosomal dominant) but can be acquired (hypertension, aortic stenosis, hyperparathyroidism, Fabry disease, Friedreich ataxia, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease, neuromuscular disease, myotonic dystrophy). 3. In DCM, heart function is reduced with symptoms of heart failure like breathlessness, fatigue, swelling of legs and abdomen, frequent nose-bleeds. In HCM, symptoms are due to obstruction to blood flow like breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations, fainting episodes. 4. DCM is treated with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and antiarrhythmic agents. Definitive treatment is heart transplant. HCM is treated with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. In severe cases, surgical myomectomy is done. 5. In both cases, patients should avoid strenuous exercise, take proper rest, avoid salt and fluid retention. 6. Life expectancy depends on the cause and severity of the disease.","1. Cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged.

I have read your query. Albinism is a condition of total absence of color in the skin, hair and eyes due to a defect in melanin synthesis. It may be of two types: 1) Oculocutaneous albinism - involving skin and eyes. 2) Ocular albinism - involving only eyes. Since you have pigmentation of skin and eyes, it means you have oculocutaneous albinism. You may have some pigmentation of skin, but it will be in patches. This is called Piebaldism. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.","1) Oculocutaneous albinism. This form of albinism is caused by mutations in one of several genes that are needed to produce melanin. People with this condition have very light skin, light-colored hair, and light-colored eyes.

Lifestyle changes may help reduce the symptoms of GERD. These changes include: 2. Medications. Medications can help reduce the symptoms of GERD. Two types of medications are used for GERD: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These medications reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach. Examples include omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Nexium), and esomeprazole (Nexium). H2 blockers. These medications reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach. Examples include famotidine (Pepcid) and ranitidine (Zantac). Antacids. These medications are used to relieve symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. Examples include Maalox, Pepto-Bismol, and Tums. Combination PPI-H2 blocker medications. Examples include Pepcid Complete and Zantac Complete. 3. Surgery. In severe cases of GERD that do not respond to medications, surgery may be needed. Surgery can be done laparoscopically (through a small incision made while looking through a laparoscope) or as an open procedure (through a larger incision). The surgeon may choose to perform a laparoscopy to diagnose HERD or to perform the surgery. The surgeon may choose to perform a laparoscopy to diagnose HERD or to perform the surgery. The surgeon may choose to perform a fundoplication, which is a 360-degree wrap of the upper part of the stomach around the lower part of the esophagus. This procedure is used to create a barrier between the acid and the esophagus. Other surgeries include a partial wrap (done to reduce the amount of acid produced) or a modernization, which is a less invasive procedure that uses a small band to keep the lower esophageal sphincter closed.","1.

"1. Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones. 2. It is usually diagnosed by a physical examination and a family history. 3. There are several types of OI. Type 1 is the most common. 4. The symptoms of this condition vary from person to person. 5. People with this condition have bones that break easily. 6. They may also have deformed bones. 7. People with OI usually have short stature. 8. Other symptoms include hearing loss, blue sclera, dental problems, and poor growth. 9. The diagnosis is usually made by physical examination, family history, and x-rays. 10. There is no cure for OI. Treatment involves orthopedic surgery and dental care. 11. People with this condition may also need physical therapy. 12. In some cases, hearing aids may be needed. 13. People with OI should avoid contact sports. 14. They should also avoid activities that may result in a fall or injury. 15. A genetic test can help determine if a person has OI. 16. There are also tests that can determine the type and severity of the condition. 17. These tests may be done to help plan a treatment program. 18. People with OI should talk to a genetic counselor. 19. A genetic counselor can discuss inheritance patterns and explain how the disease is diagnosed. 20. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides information on many types of inherited bone disorders, including OI.","Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones that break easily. It is one of the most common genetic disorders causing brittle bones.  Symptoms vary among people and can include:  - Bone fractures that may occur with little or no trauma.  - Dentinogenesis imperfecta, a blue or brown discoloration of the teeth.  - Hearing loss.  - Short stature.  - Vision problems.  - Other abnormalities affecting the skin, joints, and other areas of the body.  OI is caused by a mutation or change in a gene that produces type I collagen. This gene is found on chromosome 17.  The disorder is most often inherited from a person's parents. If both parents have OI, there is a 50% chance of the child having the disorder. If one parent has OI, there is a 50% chance of the child having OI. If neither parent has OI, there is a 60% chance that the child will be unaffected, and a 40% chance that the child will inherit OI from one of the parents.  Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical examination, and genetic testing. There is no cure for OI. Treatment involves pain control and preventing and treating fractures. People with OI are often small and thin. They may have a shortened life span due to the effects of the disorder on the skeleton and other areas of the body.","1. When a child has multiple fractures, especially if they are in unusual locations or if they are more severe than expected for the mechanism of injury, it raises concerns about possible child abuse. 2. However, when a child has a genetic condition known to cause bone fragility (such as OI), it is important to consider that the fractures may be due to the underlying genetic condition rather than child abuse. 3. The American Academy of Pediatrics website has a section on child abuse prevention, which includes a list of resources for providers and families. 4. The Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) provides information about genetic conditions and resources for families. 5.

It is usually present at birth, but symptoms may develop later in childhood.  There are several types of OI, each of which has different signs and symptoms.  The most common type is caused by a mutation in one of two genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which produce the protein collagen.  Other types are caused by mutations in other genes that produce collagen.  In rare cases, OI is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces a protein called PLOD1.  People with OI have very fragile bones that break easily.  They are prone to frequent fractures, which may cause deformities.  Other signs and symptoms include poor growth, hearing loss, and blue sclerae (the whites of the eyes appear blue).  A dental abnormality called dentinogenesis imperfecta may also occur.  There is no cure for OI, but treatments can help relieve symptoms.  People with OI are encouraged to take part in activities and sports within their abilities.  They may need physical therapy or assistive devices, such as braces or wheelchairs.

Pulsed dye laser is also effective in wart removal.,"1. The most effective medicine or cream for warts is salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is available as a 17% solution in a variety of private-label over-the-counter preparations. The solution should be applied twice daily to the wart, and the area should be allowed to dry before the wart is covered with a bandage. Warts may take weeks to months to disappear; some may require 4-6 months of treatment. 2. If salicylic acid is not effective, other topical treatments that can be applied at home include: - Podophyllin - Podofilox - Trichloroacetic acid - Curettage with or without a topical agent 3. Other home treatments include: - Freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen - Cautery - Laser treatment","1. Wart-free skin: Keep the skin around the wart clean and dry. Avoid walking barefoot in locker rooms and swimming pools. Use foot masks or corn pads after washing the feet. Do not try to remove warts with over-the-counter medications or other home remedies. 2. Wart-away creams: Two types of over-the-counter medications are available. One contains a chemical that destroys skin cells. The other contains a small amount of a weak acid that dissolves the skin covering the wart. These medications usually work best on warts on hands and feet. Do not use them on face or genital warts. 3. Freezing warts: Your doctor may use liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. This is a common treatment for warts on the face, hands, and feet. It may take several weeks to get rid of the wart. 4. Burning warts: Your doctor may burn the wart with an electric current. This is a common treatment for warts on the face, hands, and feet.

Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night) and sensitivity to light, which can lead to cataracts and blindness.  Kidney damage (nephropathy), which can lead to kidney failure and cause the need for dialysis or transplantation.  Nerve damage in the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption.  Sexual dysfunction.  Decreased immune function, which can make it easier for people to get certain infections. 2. The risk of complications is greater with higher blood glucose levels. A1C levels reflect average blood glucose levels over a 2- to 3-month period. 3. The risk of complications is also greater when diabetes is diagnosed at a younger age. 4. Good control of blood glucose levels can reduce the risk of developing complications.","1) Eye problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the retina. This is called diabetic retinopathy. It is important to have regular eye exams to check for this. High blood glucose levels over a long period of time can also cause the lens to beclouded, which can cause vision problems. 2) Kidney problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This is called diabetic nephropathy. It is important to have regular blood and urine tests to check the kidneys. 3) Nerve problems: Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels that supply nerves. This is called diabetic neuropathy. It can cause numbness, tingling, severe pain, and more. It is important to watch for any loss of sensation in the feet and hands. 4) Heart problems: Diabetes can damage the blood vessels that supply the heart. This is called coronary artery disease. It is important to have regular checkups with a health care provider and to work on keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible."

As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2) The kidneys normally remove acid from the blood by filtering it through the glomeruli (small filters) and then reabsorbing the bicarbonate ions into the blood. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb bicarbonate ions, which results in too much acid in the blood. 3) The condition is caused by genetic changes (mutations) in the ATP6N gene or the ATP6NL gene. These genes encode proteins that are critical for the function of the renal tubules. 4) Distal renal tubular acidosis is a rare genetic disorder and occurs in both inherited and non-inherited forms. 5) The condition may be present at birth (congenital) or develop during childhood or adolescence. 6) Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include: - frequent urination - dehydration - weak bones - kidney stones - abnormal levels of potassium, calcium, and/or phosphorus in the blood 7) Treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis involves taking vitamin and mineral supplements and limiting the amount of acid in the diet.","1) Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disease characterized by a defect in the ability of the kidneys to acidify the urine. 2) The most common form of dRTA is due to a failure of the kidney to secrete hydrogen ions (H+). 3) This type of dRTA is usually the result of an inherited genetic defect. 4) The most common genetic defect causing dRTA is the autosomal recessive form of dRTA with hypokalemia (dRTA-AKI) due to mutations in the gene encoding the H+/K+ antiporter. 5) The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) is a non-profit organization that provides education and support to people living with kidney disease. 6) AAKP's mission is to help people with kidney disease, their families and those who provide care to them by providing access to information and opportunities for education, support and advocacy. 7) AAKP's website is a good source of information about kidney disease and related issues. 8) The following link will take you to AAKP's page on kidney stones: http://www.aakp.org/page.cfm?pageID=330&category=Kidney%20Stones 9) The following link will take you to AAKP's page on urinary tract infections: http://www.aakp.org/page.cfm?pageID=330&category=Urinary%20Tract%20Infections 10) The following link will take you to AAKP's page on urinary tract stones: http://www.aakp.org/page.cfm?pageID=330&category=Urinary%20Tract%20Stones 11) The following link will take you to AAKP's page on acute kidney injury: http://www.aakp.org/page.cfm?pageID=330&category=Acute%20Kidney%20Injury 12) The following link will take you to AAKP's page on chronic kidney disease: http","I am sorry, but I do not know of any support group or association for distal renal tubular acidosis.

This can be done by visiting a doctor who will examine the insects/worms and then advise you accordingly. 3. Once the type of insects/worms is identified, then the treatment can be started. This could be in the form of medications or certain measures that need to be taken to prevent re-infestation. 4. In general, it is important to keep the house clean and hygienic to prevent any infestation.","1. If you're using a public shower, bring your own towel.2. Shower with hot water and soap, rinsing well and making sure to scrub underarms, groin area, and feet.3.

Avoid sharing towels with others.6. Change your towel often, especially after sweating.7. Consider using an over-the-counter antifungal cream or powder to keep your groin area and feet dry and free from fungal infections.8. Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes.9. Wash underwear and workout clothes frequently.10. Use a disinfectant to clean shower floors and other surfaces.","1. If your clothes are washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer, any eggs or larvae will be killed. 2. If your clothes are not washed in hot water, and are simply shaken outside to get rid of the insects, the insects may survive in the seams of the clothes. 3. If you suspect that your clothes have been infested by lice, you should have them professionally treated by a company that specializes in de-lousing clothes.","1) The tiny pests your family is plagued with are likely bed bugs.  Bed bugs hide in mattress seams and are active at night when they feed on humans.  They can be transported in luggage or on clothing and then infest an entire house or apartment.  To get rid of them, the mattress and box spring must be carefully cleaned and then sprayed with a pesticide designed specifically for bed bug elimination.  The pesticide must be left on for the required length of time (usually overnight) before laundering the bedding and clothing.  A second treatment may be necessary if the infestation is severe.  Thorough cleaning of all clothing and bedding is essential.  Thorough vacuuming of carpeting and furniture is also necessary.  The best way to prevent reinfestation is to keep all clothing and bedding in plastic bags and not bring them into contact with the skin."

"1. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. TSD causes mental and physical retardation, and usually results in death by age 4. TSD is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A, which is necessary for the metabolism of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside. Without this enzyme, the GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. This causes the nerve cells to die, resulting in the symptoms of TSD. Clubfoot is when the foot turns inward and downward. It is usually obvious at birth, but it may develop during the first few months of life. It occurs in about 1 in 1,000 births.  2.

It is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A. Without this enzyme, a fatty substance, or lipid, called GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. This accumulation interferes with normal nerve cell function and causes progressive damage. Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. When both parents carry the defective gene, there is a 25% chance of the child having the disease. Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first few months of life. Then mental and physical deterioration begin. The child loses previously acquired skills such as sitting and crawling. The infant's face appears longer, the eyes appear to bulge, and the child becomes blind and deaf. The child's body begins to twist and contort, and the muscles become weak and floppy. The child's mind gradually deteriorates, and the child is eventually unable to swallow. The disease is fatal, and most children with Tay-Sachs die by age 4. There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. 2) Clubfoot: Clubfoot is a condition in which the foot turns inward and downward. It is often obvious from birth or becomes apparent soon after. The cause is unknown, but it may run in families. It affects boys twice as often as girls. Treatment depends on how severe the problem is. Mild cases may not need treatment.

"1. Excess glucose in the blood can be used to make fat, which is stored in fat cells. The fat cells can then release stored fat into the bloodstream, which can be used by other cells in the body for energy. This cycle is called the glucose-fatty acid cycle or the triglyceride-fatty acid cycle.2. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose enter cells of the body. Insulin resistance means that cells are less able to respond to insulin. As a result, glucose stays in the blood longer.3. Insulin resistance is linked to obesity, lack of exercise, and poor eating habits. It also may be due to aging, infections, certain medicines, and various conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone problems (such as Cushing's syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome).","1. The pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, which helps glucose enter cells and be stored or used for energy. In diabetes, the pancreas produces less insulin or doesn't use it well. 2.

The brain, stomach, and urine bladder have a high concentration of alpha-amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starches into simple sugars that are absorbed by the body. 2. The urine bladder gains weight due to the increased absorption of glucose from the urine.","1. In diabetes, brain loses its sensitivity to glucose. Thus, brain does not respond to increased blood glucose levels and hence does not signal the pancreas to secrete insulin. In diabetes, the pancreas fails to secrete adequate insulin to meet the body's needs. 2. The stomach does not contribute to the increase in blood sugar levels. The stomach secretes a hormone called gastrin. Gastrin increases the secretion of gastric acid by the stomach. Gastric acid is needed for the breakdown of food and for the absorption of nutrients. 3. The urine bladder becomes disproportionately heavier because glucose and fatty acids are lost into the urine. The kidneys filter blood to remove waste products, including glucose and fatty acids, and put them into the urine.

"1. What is trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is a condition that affects the body's ability to process trimethylamine (TMA), a chemical compound that has a pungent odor similar to rotting fish or garbage. People with trimethylaminuria have high levels of TMA in their urine, sweat, and breath. This causes a strong, unpleasant odor that can affect a person's quality of life. 2. What causes trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene. This gene makes a protein that plays a role in metabolizing TMA. When the gene is mutated, the body cannot process TMA properly. As a result, TMA builds up in the body and is released through the breath, sweat, and urine. 3. Who is at risk for trimethylaminuria? Trimethylaminuria is an inherited condition. If both parents have the condition, there is a 25% chance that their child will have it. If only one parent has the condition, the child has a 50% chance of inheriting it. 4. What are the symptoms of trimethylaminuria? The most obvious symptom of trimethylaminuria is a strong body odor that smells like rotting fish or garbage. The odor is usually present all the time, but it may be worse when a person is under stress or sweating. People with trimethylaminuria may also have yellowish skin, greasy skin, and blisters or peeling skin on the hands and feet. 5. How is trimethylaminuria diagnosed? A doctor may suspect trimethylaminuria based on a person's symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctor will order a urine test to check for high levels of TMA. In some cases, the doctor may also order a blood test or genetic test to look for the FMO3 gene mutation. 6. How is trimethylaminuria treated? There is no cure for trimethylaminuria. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. People with the condition can try the following measures to reduce body odor: -","1. Yes, we can help you with researching gene therapy as a potential solution to eliminate the fish/feces odor that's ruining your daily life.2. TMAU is due to a defect in the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene, which is an enzyme that helps break down certain chemicals in your body.3. The condition is caused by a buildup of trimethylamine (TMA) in the body, which gives off a fishy smell.4. Gene therapy involves the introduction of a normal copy of a gene into a cell to replace a copy with a defect, so that the cell makes the normal protein.5. Researchers are currently working on gene therapy for TMAU, but it is still in the early stages of development.6. The goal of gene therapy for TMAU is to restore the function of the FMO3 gene by introducing a working copy of the gene into your cells.7. Two approaches are being studied: one involves inserting the gene into liver cells, and the other involves inserting it into skin cells.8. The liver approach involves injecting the gene into the liver using a harmless virus as a vector. The hope is that the liver will produce the normal FMO3 protein, which will then travel through the bloodstream to the rest of the body and eliminate the odor-causing TMA.9. The skin approach involves applying a cream containing the normal gene to the skin. The hope is that the gene will become incorporated into the skin cells, which will then produce the normal FMO3 protein.10. Both approaches are still in the early stages of development and have been tested only in animals, not humans.","1. First, you should confirm the diagnosis by doing a blood test for trimethylamine (TMA) levels. 2. Then, you should consult with a genetic counselor to determine if you have a defect in the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 gene (FMO3), which is the most common cause of TMAU. 3. If this defect is confirmed, you should consult with a physician who specializes in gene therapy to determine if this treatment is appropriate for you.","1. The first step would be to confirm the diagnosis of trimethylaminuria (TMAU) through a series of diagnostic tests. 2. Once the diagnosis of TMAU is confirmed, your healthcare provider may recommend a combination of the following treatments: - Choline supplements - Folic acid supplements - Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the way the body processes a protein called trimethylamine. Trimethylamine is a chemical compound that gives fish its smell and is also produced by the breakdown of a protein called choline. 3. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the way the body processes a protein called trimethylamine. Trimethylamine is a chemical compound that gives fish its smell and is also produced by the breakdown of a protein called choline. 4. Trimethylamine is normally broken down in the liver and excreted in the urine. But people with trimethylaminuria (TMAU) have a defect in this process, which causes the body to smell like rotting fish. 5. There is no cure for trimethylaminuria (TMAU), but some of the following measures may help: - Keeping the body clean and smelling fresh by bathing regularly - Using scented soaps or shampoos - Wearing loose-fitting clothes made of natural fibers like cotton or linen - Avoiding foods high in choline, such as eggs, nuts, and fish 6.

Bruxism is a parafunctional activity that occurs during wakefulness and sleep. 2. It is a condition that is associated with stress and anxiety. 3. Bruxism involves the grinding and/or clenching of teeth. 4. It is a condition that can lead to significant wear of the teeth, as well as pain in the jaw joints and muscles. 5. The etiology of bruxism is not completely understood, although there is speculation that it may be related to central nervous system mechanisms that are associated with stress. 6. The fact that it manifests in the jaw rather than other muscle groups is likely related to the fact that it is a parafunctional activity that is triggered by stress and anxiety.","1. The jaw is the only bony structure in the oral cavity that is directly attached to the skull by a joint (the temporomandibular joint).

Blood is unable to be pumped properly, causing symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath.","1. Congenital Heart Disease: The heart is a complex organ with 4 chambers and valves.  The heart is a pump that circulates blood throughout the body.  During fetal development, the heart forms in 4 stages.  The congenital heart defect can occur when an organ or structure does not develop properly during fetal development.  The congenital heart defect may involve the heart valves, the walls of the heart, or the major blood vessels of the heart.  The congenital heart defect may be as simple as a hole in the wall between the 2 top chambers of the heart or it may be a complex combination of defects.  The congenital heart defect may be identified before birth or shortly after birth.  The congenital heart defect may cause no symptoms or it may cause severe symptoms.  The symptoms depend on the type and the seriousness of the congenital heart defect.  The congenital heart defect may be treated with medicines, surgery, or it may not be treated.  The congenital heart defect may be associated with other conditions or disorders such as:  - Down Syndrome  - Fetal Alcohol Syndrome  - Marfan Syndrome  - Noonan Syndrome  - Turner Syndrome  - Trisomy 18 2. Heart Disease: Heart disease is an umbrella term for a group of diseases that affect the heart.  Heart disease is a common problem in the United States.  Heart disease is a condition in which the heart cannot function normally.  There are many types of heart disease.  The most common type is caused by a buildup of plaque inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart.  The buildup of plaque causes the arteries to narrow.  This makes it harder for blood to flow through the heart.  There are many factors that may increase your risk of heart disease:  - Being female  - High blood pressure  - High cholesterol  - Diabetes  - Family history of heart disease  - Obesity  - Physical inactivity  - Older age  - Smoking  - Stress  - Type A personality  - Type 2 diabetes  - Vascular disease  - Being male","1. Heart conditions are of two types: congenital and acquired. Congenital heart conditions are problems that are present at birth. Acquired heart conditions can develop or be caused later in life. 2. Some examples of congenital heart conditions are atrial septal defects (ASDs), ventricular septal defects (VSDs), patent foramen ovale (PFO), pulmonary stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. 3. Acquired heart conditions include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias. 4. To diagnose heart conditions, doctors use various tests. Some of these tests are non-invasive, meaning they do not involve injections or surgery. Examples of non-invasive tests are electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, and exercise stress tests. Invasive tests, which involve injections or surgery, include cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. 5. Treatment options vary widely, depending on the type and severity of the heart condition. Some heart conditions can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. Other heart conditions require surgery or other procedures. 6. To learn more about heart conditions, you can visit the websites of these organizations: American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Rhythm Society (linked to the website of the International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease).",1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick.

"Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that is present at birth. It affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate delays in cognitive development or learning difficulties, a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety. Infants with Williams Syndrome have a high risk of developing elevated blood pressures. Some infants develop narrowing of the aorta (the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body). This is called aortic stenosis. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing cardiac problems such as supravalvular aortic stenosis, and elevated blood calcium levels. Additional features include a star-like pattern in the iris of the eye, a long face with a wide mouth and full cheeks, a small jaw, and a prominent nose with a broad nasal bridge. Some individuals with this disorder have a curved, uplifted palpebral fissure (the slit between the eyes) and fingertip crease. Newborns often have a transient muscle hypotonia (floppy muscles) that improves during infancy. Some females have irregular menstrual cycles and/or ovarian cysts. The average IQ is 60-70. People with Williams Syndrome have excellent verbal abilities but deficits in visuospatial skills. Many individuals with this disorder have difficulty with fine motor skills such as using scissors or tying shoe laces. The personality of individuals with Williams Syndrome is unique. They are very friendly and empathetic but also anxious and easily distracted. They are overly interested in other people, yet have trouble forming close relationships. Affected individuals have a high desire to help others, but they can be stubborn and have trouble following instructions. In general, people with Williams Syndrome have excellent social skills but poor job skills. Other features of this disorder include a high arch in the palate, dental abnormalities such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, or crooked, and abnormalities of the digestive system such as a gastrointestinal tract that is narrow or floppy. The cause","1. Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 7, which is a condition known as chromosomal duplication. 2.

People with Williams syndrome are very friendly and tend to take an interest in others. However, they may also have problems with attention and may be easily distracted. 4. People with Williams syndrome are also very interested in music and often have perfect pitch. 5. Affected individuals also have problems with visuospatial tasks, which involve the ability to think in three dimensions and to understand how two-dimensional shapes can look three-dimensional. 6. People with Williams syndrome often have a long-term health problem called hypercalcemia, which is a high level of calcium in the blood. This can lead to problems such as kidney stones. 7. There is no specific treatment for Williams syndrome. However, people with this condition may need treatment for the health problems that it causes. 8. Most people with Williams syndrome have normal lifespans.","Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of a microdeletion in the person's chromosome. The symptoms of this disorder include mild to moderate intellectual disability, a distinctive facial appearance, heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems, and digestive system problems. People with Williams Syndrome may also have behavioral and emotional problems, such as anxiety and problems with attention.  The symptoms vary from person to person. Some people have mild symptoms while others have more severe symptoms. People with milder forms of Williams Syndrome may have only minor learning disabilities and may not have a distinctive facial appearance.  Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder. Genetic disorders are caused by a problem with a gene. A gene is a small part of DNA, which is the genetic material in all cells. Each person has two copies of their gene, one from their mother and one from their father. Someone with Williams Syndrome inherited two copies of the gene, one from their mother and one from their father, or they have a gene mutation that causes the disorder.  Williams Syndrome affects between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 7,000 people. It occurs in all populations. It is more common in people who are born to mothers who are over 35 years old.","1) Individuals with Williams Syndrome (WS) have distinctive cognitive, behavioral, and physical characteristics. 2) WS is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23) Individuals with WS are typically short, have a distinctive facial appearance, and have mild to moderate intellectual disability. 4) Individuals with WS are very friendly and have empathy for others. 5) Individuals with WS are also very interested in music and can learn songs quickly. 6) They may have problems with attention and organization. 7) Individuals with WS have a high risk of having a heart problem, so it is important to get regular checkups with a heart doctor. 8) Individuals with WS may also have problems with their blood vessels, including narrowing of the blood vessels in their legs. 9) Individuals with WS may have a curved foot. 10) Some individuals with WS have a seizure disorder. 11) Individuals with WS can live a normal life with treatment and support.","Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body.

People with Williams Syndrome typically have excellent verbal abilities but encounter difficulties with visuospatial tasks. They tend to be very friendly and outgoing, but also anxious and easily distracted.  Williams Syndrome is caused by a deletion on a particular spot on chromosome 7. This genetic change or mutation is present at birth. However, the symptoms of this disorder may not appear until later in life.  Williams Syndrome is a relatively rare genetic disorder. It occurs in about 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 20,000 individuals. Males and females are affected equally.  There is no known way to prevent Williams Syndrome. However, genetic testing can detect the genetic change that causes this disorder in a developing fetus or an early embryo.","Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of a microdeletion on chromosome 7 in all or part of the affected person's cells. Williams Syndrome affects about 1 in 8,000 people. It is most common in Caucasian people, but it can affect people of other races. Williams Syndrome is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability. People with this disorder have distinctive facial features, a unique personality, and a heightened interest in music. The disorder also affects the heart and blood vessels and can cause problems with the kidneys and liver. Children with Williams Syndrome are usually diagnosed during childhood, often because of delays in reaching developmental milestones. They may have a health condition related to the disorder, such as a heart problem, or they may have a fever or other signs of illness. Diagnosis is based on a physical exam, medical and family histories, and tests. There is no cure for Williams Syndrome, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Children with the disorder should receive regular checkups with a health care professional. Early diagnosis and treatment can help people with Williams Syndrome reach their full potential.

"Hi, Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring) and neuronal loss.  The course of the disease is highly variable. In some patients it is very aggressive from the beginning and in others it proceeds slowly for many years.  There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, but disease modifying agents are available which can reduce the disease activity.  These include interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod etc.  The newer agents are very effective and have been shown to reduce relapse rate by 50% in recent studies.  These agents are very expensive and are not available to all patients.  In the future stem cell therapy may be a possibility.  Regards","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  There are several forms of MS, but the most common is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).  In RRMS, patients experience unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission).  Over time, the disease can become progressive, with a steady functional decline (secondary progressive MS).  Other forms of MS include primary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS.  The disease most commonly affects young adults, particularly women.  The clinical course is quite variable, although most patients require some assistance with walking within 10 to 20 years of disease onset.  Factors that correlate with a relatively good prognosis include female sex, younger age at onset, and lower disability at 5 years.  Factors associated with a poor prognosis include male sex, older age at onset, and high disability at 5 years.  In patients with RRMS, the long-term outlook is reasonably favorable.  Over 90% of patients are still alive 25 years after diagnosis, and most can expect a normal life expectancy.  However, the unpredictable nature of the disease makes it impossible to give precise survival figures.  The disease is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission).

The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission). The other type of MS is progressive, which is characterized by a steady neurologic decline from disease onset. MS is generally diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other tests can be used to help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for MS is generally divided into four categories: disease-modifying agents (DMAs), symptomatic treatments, lifestyle changes, and rehabilitation. DMAs are used to modify the course of the disease, and include first-generation DMAs (interferons and glatiramer acetate) and second-generation DMAs (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and dalfampridine). Symptomatic treatments include medications for pain, bladder dysfunction, and spasticity. Lifestyle changes include exercise, diet, and stress reduction. Rehabilitation can include physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Question: What treatments are available for multiple sclerosis? Answer: There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, but medications may help to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, and help to slow the progression of physical disability. The goals of treatment are to:  Prevent or control symptoms  Help you maintain your quality of life  Prevent or control relapses  Slow the progression of this disease  Help restore or maintain function  Reduce disability over time Question: What are the different types of multiple sclerosis?

It is believed to be triggered by an initial event, such as a viral infection or trauma, which causes the immune system to attack the myelin sheath. The goal of MS treatment is to stop or slow the process that leads to neurological disability. Current treatments are designed to modify the immune system or the inflammatory process in the central nervous system. While none of the treatments available so far have proven to be curative, some have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, and slow the progression of physical disability. With regard to the possibility of a cure for MS, it is too early to say whether a cure will be found, but research is moving ahead at a rapid pace. Several clinical trials involving new therapies are currently underway.",Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers.  The cause of the disease is still not known.  There is no cure for multiple sclerosis but medications are available to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.

It most commonly presents with fatigue, optic neuritis, and motor and sensory disturbances.  Currently, there is no cure for MS, but there are several treatments available.  The treatments for MS are divided into several categories: 1. Treatments designed to modify the immune system, including medications that suppress the immune system (such as corticosteroids and azathioprine), medications that selectively target certain aspects of the immune system (such as the medications that interfere with the action of T cells and the release of inflammatory cytokines), and medications that are designed to specifically suppress the immune response (such as the medications that target T cells and certain interleukins). 2. Treatments designed to modify the course of the disease, including medications that are designed to help repair the myelin sheath (such as interferon beta and glatiramer acetate), medications that are designed to reduce the inflammatory process (such as methotrexate), and medications that are designed to help reduce symptoms (such as anticholinergics and baclofen for bladder and spasticity problems, as well as medications that reduce seizures and depression). 3. Treatments designed to help the symptoms of MS, including medications that reduce spasticity (such as baclofen and tizanidine), medications that reduce pain (such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants), medications that reduce bladder dysfunction (such as oxybutynin and tolterodine), medications that reduce bowel dysfunction (such as octreotide), medications that reduce depression (such as tricyclic antidepressants), and medications that reduce fatigue (such as amantadine and modafinil). 4.

Genetic diseases.,"Optic atrophy refers to damage to the optic nerve that results in a decrease in the number of axons passing through it.  Optic atrophy can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic causes, trauma, toxicity, and vascular causes.  Optic atrophy can be hereditary, caused by a genetic mutation in one of the genes that control the development of the optic nerve.  The most common genetic cause of optic atrophy is a mutation in the OPA1 gene, which can cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy.  Other genetic mutations that can cause optic atrophy include mutations in the OPA3, GJA8, and CNGB3 genes.  In rare cases, optic atrophy can be caused by genetic mutations in one of the other genes that control the development of the optic nerve.  The symptoms of optic atrophy depend on the cause and the severity of the damage to the optic nerve.  People with optic atrophy may experience loss of peripheral vision, loss of night vision (nyctalopia), and loss of color vision (achromatopsia).  In some cases, optic atrophy can lead to complete blindness.  The prognosis for optic atrophy depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the damage to the optic nerve.  People with optic atrophy due to a genetic mutation may have a slowly progressive loss of vision, while people with optic atrophy due to other causes may have a stable or improving level of vision.  In some cases, vision loss due to optic atrophy may be irreversible.",1000 causes of optic atrophy have been identified. Optic atrophy is not a genetic condition.,"1. Optic atrophy is a genetic disorder caused by a problem with the OPS (optic nerve and its surrounding tissues). 2. Optic atrophy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including: - inherited genetic disorders - problems with the development of the eye before birth (congenital) - problems with the optic nerve or surrounding tissues that occur after birth - trauma to the eye or optic nerve - certain medications - exposure to toxins.","1. Optic atrophy is a condition in which the optic nerve becomes damaged, leading to a progressive loss of vision. 2. The most common cause of optic atrophy is a disease called glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure within the eye increases, damaging the optic nerve. 3. Optic atrophy can also occur as a result of trauma to the eye, infection, or as a side effect of certain medications. 4. Optic atrophy can also be hereditary, caused by a genetic mutation in the OPA1 gene. 5. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called optic atrophy 1 protein, which is involved in mitochondrial function. 6. Researchers have proposed that optic atrophy may be caused by a defect in the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. 7. When the OPA1 gene is mutated, cells may not be able to produce enough energy to support normal cell functions. 8. Without enough energy, cells in the optic nerve may begin to die, leading to optic atrophy.","1. Optic atrophy refers to any condition in which the optic nerve becomes damaged or degenerates. This can occur due to a variety of causes, including trauma, toxicity, infection, inflammation, and genetic conditions. 2. There are several genetic conditions that can cause optic atrophy.

The tremors are usually most noticeable in the hands, but they may also occur in the arms, head, larynx, and tongue. 2. Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. The prevalence of essential tremor increases with age. It is estimated to affect between 0.5 and 2.0 percent of the elderly population. 3. The cause of essential tremor is unknown. The condition tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic cause. The tremor can be worsened by emotion, stress, and fatigue, but it is not clearly associated with any known medical condition. 4. Essential tremor is typically treated with propranolol, a beta-blocker, or Primidone, an antiseizure medication. Other medications that may be used include atenolol, gabapentin, topiramate, clonazepam, and alprazolam. 5. In severe cases, surgery may be considered. The most common procedures performed are pallidotomy, thalamotomy, and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). 6. While essential tremor and Parkinson's disease are both characterized by tremors, the two conditions are easily distinguished. Essential tremor is not associated with other Parkinsonian signs and symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness in movement), and postural instability. Unlike the tremor of Parkinson's disease, the tremor of essential tremor is not typically present at rest.","Essential tremor and Parkinson's disease are not the same.  Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking or trembling movements in parts of the body, especially the hands.  Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes trembling, stiffness, and slowness of movement.  Essential tremor may sometimes be mistaken for Parkinson's disease because it also causes trembling. However, people with essential tremor do not have the other symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as rigidity, slowness of movement, or postural instability.  Essential tremor usually begins in adulthood and gets worse over time.  Tremors often get worse when trying to do something like pick up a glass of water or eat a bowl of soup.  The tremors may also be worse when stressed or tired.  Essential tremor may occur at any age, but it is most common after age 70.  Essential tremor does not shorten the lifespan.  The cause of essential tremor is unknown.  Essential tremor is not contagious nor is it caused by anything a person does or does not do.  Essential tremor does not occur as a side effect of any medication.  Essential tremor is not inherited.  Essential tremor is not a form of epilepsy.  Essential tremor is not due to problems in the brain.  Essential tremor is not caused by a lack of vitamin B12.  Essential tremor is not due to problems in the nervous system.

"Dear, Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body but mainly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs. It is a serious disease that requires proper evaluation and close monitoring. Lupus is an autoimmune disease. Normally, the immune system protects the body against foreign substances and organisms; however, in lupus, the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This leads to swelling, pain, and fatigue. There is no cure for lupus, but medications can relieve symptoms and prevent flares. Lupus can be controlled through proper medication, rest, and avoiding exposure to the sun and other triggers. Treatment of lupus depends on the organ systems affected and the severity of symptoms.  The goals of lupus treatment include:  -Preventing flares  -Treating active disease  -Reducing organ damage and other complications  -Minimizing medication side effects  -Providing supportive care  -Helping patients cope with the emotional and psychological effects of the disease.  -Treatment of lupus involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. The choice of medications depends on the symptoms and the parts of the body affected.  -Medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants.  -NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation. Antimalarial drugs are used to treat skin manifestations and reduce the risk of lupus nephritis.  -Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Immunosuppressants also reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system.  -Medications may be taken by mouth or injected. Corticosteroids may also be given as a nasal spray or as eye drops.  -Lifestyle changes include getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Patients should also avoid exposure to the sun and other known triggers.  -Patients should talk to their doctors about complementary and alternative therapies.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs. It is often called a ""systemic"" disease because it affects many parts of the body.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect many parts of the body. The main symptoms include pain and swelling in joints, skin rashes, fever, chest pain, and hair loss. It is often called a ""silent disease"" because there may be no symptoms for years. The course of the disease is unpredictable. It may be mild and not require treatment, or it may be severe and require lifelong treatment.  Treatment depends on the symptoms and may include medicines, lifestyle changes, and physical therapy.  Lupus is treated with drugs that suppress the immune system. They include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, and corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines that may be taken by mouth or injected.  Other medicines used to treat lupus include:  - Anticoagulants, which are blood thinners that prevent clots from forming or reduce the size of clots that have formed  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which control pain and swelling  - Osteoporosis medicines, which are used to prevent bone loss  - Medicines that suppress the immune system, including cyclophosphamide and azathioprine  - Medicines to treat depression or nerve pain  - Medicines to help control the symptoms of lupus, including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and nerve pain medicines  - Medicines used to treat specific symptoms, such as antibiotics to treat infection or medicines to help control the urine flow  - Vaccines to prevent infection","1) Medications: There are several types of medications that can be used to treat lupus, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents. 2) Lifestyle Changes: A healthy lifestyle can help manage symptoms and prevent flares. This includes eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and managing stress. 3) Sun Protection: People with lupus should protect themselves from the sun. They should wear clothing that covers arms and legs, wear a wide-brimmed hat, and use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. 4) Vaccinations: People with lupus should get vaccinated to prevent infections. This includes getting the flu vaccine every year, a pneumococcal vaccine once, and a booster for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough) every 10 years. 5) Treatment for Specific Symptoms: If a person with lupus has joint pain, the doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroids, or a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). For skin lesions, the doctor may prescribe a topical or oral corticosteroid, antimalarial drug, or immunosuppressive drug.","Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, organs, and blood. Treatments can include medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery.  What is lupus?  Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means your body's immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue by mistake. This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.  Who gets lupus?  Lupus is often seen in young women. You are more likely to get it if you are African American, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American. You also have a higher risk if you have a family member with the disease.  What are the symptoms?

"1. Chicken pox is a common childhood disease that most people get when they are young. By adulthood, about 90% of people have had chicken pox and developed immunity to it. 2. The chicken pox vaccine is recommended for people who have not had chicken pox, have never been vaccinated against it, and are at risk of being exposed to the disease. 3. Vaccination provides protection against chicken pox, but it does not prevent a person from getting shingles. 4. A blood test can check whether you have antibodies to the virus that causes chicken pox. If you have these antibodies, it means that you are already protected against chicken pox. 5. If you do not have these antibodies, it means that you are not protected against chicken pox. If you think that you may have had chicken pox, but you are not sure, you should get the chicken pox vaccine. It is very easy to get the vaccine, and it is usually given by injection. 6. The chicken pox vaccine is usually given to children between 12 and 18 months of age. Older children and adults can also get the vaccine. 7. The chicken pox vaccine is a live, weakened virus. It is safe and effective, and it provides long-lasting protection against chicken pox. 8. If you think that you may have had chicken pox, but you are not sure, you should get the chicken pox vaccine. It is very easy to get the vaccine, and it is usually given by injection.","1. The best way to determine if you've had chickenpox is to ask your parents or other family members if you had chickenpox as a child. 2. To check if you've had chickenpox, your healthcare provider will need to do a blood test that looks for antibodies to the virus that causes chickenpox.","1) The best way to find out if you've had chickenpox is to ask your parents, if you're under age 18, or to look at your own records if you're over age 18.  Many schools and workplaces require proof of immunity or evidence of disease before you can attend.  If you're not sure, it's better to get the vaccine than not to. 2) There are several tests that can confirm whether you've had chickenpox or not.  Your doctor can order a blood test to see if you have antibodies to the virus that causes chickenpox.  You can also ask your doctor to check for the scar from the chickenpox rash.  If you have a scar, you probably have had chickenpox.","1. The chicken pox is a common childhood illness that most people get when they are young. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. 2. After an episode of chicken pox, the virus lies dormant in the body. 3. Years later, the virus can re-emerge as shingles. 4. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is characterized by a painful rash, usually limited to one area of the body. 5. The shingles vaccine can prevent this rash and the associated pain. 6. To determine if you have had chicken pox, your health care provider can perform a blood test. If the test shows that you are immune to chicken pox, then you have already had the disease. 7. If the test shows that you are not immune to chicken pox, you may be vaccinated against it.","1) Your doctor can diagnose chickenpox by examining the rash and asking questions about your medical history. There is no specific test for chickenpox. 2) To determine whether you have had chickenpox in the past, your doctor may ask whether you have had the disease or received the vaccine.

"1. Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood. It is the most common type of blood cancer and affects the normal blood cells which are produced in the bone marrow. 2. Some types of leukemia can be cured while others cannot. People with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may be cured with treatment. People with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have a better chance of being cured than people with AML or CML. 3. The symptoms of leukemia depend on the type of leukemia and how much it affects the body. People with leukemia may have no symptoms or may have symptoms that are not specific to leukemia. Some symptoms of leukemia are fatigue, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite and weight loss. Swelling or pain in the bones or joints, bleeding or bruising, or recurrent infections can also be symptoms of leukemia. 4. There is no evidence that leukemia is inherited. 5. Acute leukemia is the most serious type of leukemia. People with acute leukemia need treatment right away. People with chronic leukemia may not need treatment right away. The doctor will watch and wait to see how the disease progresses. 6. The outlook for people with leukemia depends on many things, including the type of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, and whether the leukemia has been treated. The outlook is usually better for people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than for people with acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia. 7. There are certain signs and symptoms that may indicate leukemia, such as bleeding or bruising, recurrent infections, and fatigue. The doctor may suspect leukemia if the results of a routine blood test show too many white blood cells. To diagnose leukemia, the doctor will do a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). The doctor will also do other tests, including a bone marrow biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis. 8. The treatment of leukemia","1. The causes of leukemia cancer are largely unknown, but genetic abnormalities and environmental factors may play a role. 2. While there is no cure for leukemia, there are treatments that can prolong survival and improve quality of life. 3. The main effect of leukemia is the accumulation of large numbers of abnormal white blood cells, which can crowd out the healthy blood cells. 4. Leukemia is not considered to be a genetic disorder, but inherited genetic mutations can increase the risk of developing certain types of leukemia. 5. Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. 6. The average life expectancy for someone with leukemia varies widely depending on the type and extent of the disease. 7. Some symptoms of leukemia are fatigue, weakness, pale skin, bleeding or bruising easily, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. 8. Treatment for leukemia typically involves chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. 9. The most common indicators of leukemia are fatigue, weakness, pale skin, easy bruising or bleeding, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. 10. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia that affect the bone marrow and blood.

###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.","1. What triggers the development of leukemia cancer?

The exact cause of leukemia is not known. However, a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for the development of leukemia.

Answer: 2. Can leukemia be overcome?

Yes, leukemia can be overcome. Treatment options for leukemia include chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplantation. With proper treatment and care, many people with leukemia can have long-term survival or cure.

Answer: 3. In what ways does leukemia affect the body?

Leukemia cells can grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy blood cells and causing a decrease in the number of healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to anemia (low red blood cell count), weakened immune system, and easy bleeding and bruising (low platelet count).

Answer: 4. Is there a genetic link to leukemia?

There is a genetic link to some types of leukemia. For example, individuals with a history of certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Patau syndrome, have an increased risk of developing leukemia. Similarly, individuals with a family history of leukemia also have an increased risk of developing the disease.

Answer: 5. What characterizes advanced leukemia?

In advanced leukemia, the leukemia cells can grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy blood cells and causing a decrease in the number of healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to anemia (low red blood cell count), weakened immune system, and easy bleeding and bruising (low platelet count). Advanced leukemia can also affect the bone marrow, leading to anemia, and can spread outside of the blood and bone marrow to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and brain.

Answer: 6. How long can a person with leukemia typically expect to live?

The prognosis of leukemia depends on the type of leukemia,","1. Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, which are produced in the bone marrow and which help to fight infection. Leukemia causes an increase in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can interfere with the production of other types of blood cells, such as red and platelet cells. 2. Yes, leukemia is a survivable disease. With treatment, many people with leukemia can be cured. However, the course of the disease and the prognosis varies widely depending on the type and extent of the leukemia. 3. The symptoms of leukemia are caused by the increased number of abnormal white blood cells in the body. The abnormal cells can crowd out the healthy blood cells, reducing the number of red blood cells and platelets in the body. This condition can cause anemia and easy bruising and bleeding. The abnormal white blood cells can also cause pressure on other organs, such as the spleen and liver, and can suppress bone marrow, reducing the production of red and white blood cells and platelets. 4. Although there is a genetic component to leukemia, it is not inherited. A person with a family history of leukemia, however, may have an increased risk of developing the disease. 5. Advanced leukemia refers to leukemia that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain or spinal cord. 6. With treatment, many people with leukemia can be cured. However, the course of the disease and the prognosis varies widely depending on the type and extent of the leukemia. 7. Yes, leukemia can be detected early on. The diagnosis of leukemia is made by a blood test that measures the number and types of cells in the blood. 8. The recommended treatments for leukemia depend on the type and extent of the disease. For most types of leukemia, treatment usually involves chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Some types of leukemia may also be treated with biological therapy, which uses substances made from living cells to help the immune system fight cancer, or with targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other treatments that target specific molecules in cancer cells. 9. The most common symptoms of leukemia include","1. Researchers don't know what causes most cases of leukemia. However, the risk of getting CLL and CML increases as people age. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene, may increase the risk of getting leukemia. 2. Some patients can recover from leukemia. However, most people diagnosed with leukemia will live with the disease for the rest of their lives. Some patients may eventually develop advanced leukemia. 3. Leukemia cells can crowd out the healthy blood cells made by bone marrow. This makes it difficult for the body to fight infections. Leukemia cells can also spread to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. 4. No, leukemia is not passed down through genes. 5. Acute leukemia is usually an advanced stage of the disease. Chronic leukemia is usually not advanced. 6. The prognosis depends on many factors, including the type of leukemia, age, and general health. People with a good prognosis may live 5 to 8 years, while people with a poor prognosis may live 1 to 2 years. 7. In most cases, there are no visible signs of leukemia. However, in some cases, there may be swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen or liver, or abnormal bleeding. 8. The first step in treating leukemia is to induce remission, meaning the number of leukemia cells in the body decreases. In many cases, the next step is consolidation therapy, which attempts to destroy any remaining leukemia cells. Maintenance therapy may follow to help keep the disease in remission. 9. Early signs of leukemia may include fatigue, weakness, and frequent infections. Bleeding and bruising may also occur.

Answer: 10. AML and CML are very different diseases. AML usually affects adults and is a fast-growing cancer that causes severe bone marrow failure. CML usually affects adults and is a slow-growing disease that causes a slight increase in the number of white blood cells.","1. Factors that may increase your risk of getting leukemia include:

"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. The disorder is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. These may include: difficulty walking, frequent falls, and toe walking. The disease typically progresses so that an affected individual will not be able to walk by age 12 and may not survive beyond the early 20s. The heart and respiratory muscles may also be affected.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is caused by an inherited defect in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The disease is usually first noticed in boys between ages 3 and 5. The disease progresses rapidly, and boys are wheelchair-bound by age 12. They typically die by age 20, often due to respiratory failure. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Male children get one defective copy of the gene from their mother and one normal copy from their father. Female children get one defective copy of the gene from their father and one normal copy from their mother. They are considered carriers of the disorder.  Affected boys may have difficulty keeping their balance, and they fall frequently. They may also have trouble getting up from a lying or sitting position. Weakness begins in the legs and progresses to the arms and other areas of the body. The child may have an unusual way of walking, with the feet widely spaced and the legs turned inward. The child will have a waddling gait. As the disease progresses, the muscles of the respiratory system become weakened, making breathing difficult. The disease also affects the heart, and it may become enlarged.  Diagnosis is based on the child's physical exam, medical and family history, and muscle biopsy. Genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.  No specific treatment exists for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms. Physical therapy may help maintain muscle strength and function. Orthopedic appliances may be used to correct skeletal deformities.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.  The disorder is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep the muscle fibers intact.  The disease occurs almost exclusively in males.  Most boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are wheelchair bound by age 12 and most die before age 20.  The disorder is usually inherited from the mother, who carries a defective X chromosome.  However, about one-third of cases result from new mutations in the dystrophin gene.  There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but medication and physical therapy may prolong mobility.  Support groups are available to help patients and their families cope with the disease.  The financial impact on families can be very high because of the need for specialized medical care, assistive devices, and ongoing pharmaceutical therapy.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. The disease primarily affects young boys, causing progressive weakness, usually beginning in the legs. It affects one in 3300 boys worldwide. The term ""pseudohyperophic"" refers to the abnormal enlargement (hyperophy) of muscle tissue, which is apparent on muscle biopsy. Onset is in early childhood, with the pelvic girdle and shoulder muscles being the earliest involved. The disease is X-linked recessive. That means the defective gene is on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes (the other is the Y chromosome). Males have only one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the defective gene does not produce any protein. In females who carry the defective gene, the one good copy of the gene produces sufficient protein. Males with the defective gene are affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, while females are carriers.","Yes, you can get this information from a professional in the field.

In some cases, the Tumor can be removed by Surgery. In other cases, Radiation may be used. In some cases, Chemotherapy may be used. 3. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be used. 4. The best treatment can be decided only after a detailed study of the MRI Scan and other investigations. 5. I would suggest that you share the MRI Scan with us. And also share the details of other investigations. We would try to help you as much as possible. Hope you found the answer helpful. If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow-up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again. I will be happy to answer your questions. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care.","1. The best treatment for brain and spine tumors depends on the type and location of the tumor. 2. Surgery is the main treatment for most brain and spinal cord tumors. 3. Sometimes, radiation therapy or chemotherapy (or both) are used alone or to supplement surgery. 4. The goal of treatment is to remove or destroy as much of the tumor as possible while limiting damage to the surrounding area. 5. To determine the best treatment for a specific tumor, doctors will consider many factors, including the type and location of the tumor and the patient's age and general health. 6. For example, doctors may recommend surgery first for a tumor that can be removed without causing serious damage to the surrounding area. 7. They may recommend radiation therapy first for a tumor that is difficult to remove during surgery, or for a tumor located deep inside the brain or in another part of the body. 8. Doctors may recommend chemotherapy first for a tumor that has spread (metastasized) to another part of the body.","1. It is very difficult to remove the entire tumor, especially if it is located deep in the brain. 2. I am not sure about the type of tumor, but if you could provide the medical reports, it could help. 3. There are many experimental treatments available, but they are not approved for use in humans yet. 4. You can discuss these options with your doctor.","1. The best treatment for brain and spine tumors is surgery. 2. If surgery is not possible, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used. 3. For low-grade astrocytomas, the most common type of brain tumor in children, radiation therapy alone is often used as the primary treatment. 4. For other types of tumors, the use of chemotherapy after surgery improves survival. 5. In children, chemotherapy is often used instead of radiation therapy or in addition to radiation therapy. 6. Chemotherapy is also used when there are multiple tumors or when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery. 7. Targeted therapy uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. 8. Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood low-grade gliomas. 9. If there is a change in the appearance of the tumor on imaging studies, treatment with a different medicine may be used. 10. A clinical trial of a new medicine, called cediranib (AZD2171), for children with low-grade gliomas is currently enrolling patients.","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your brothers' history and would like to reassure you that with proper treatment, he can be cured. The diagnosis and remaining tumor can be confirmed by doing MRI scan of brain and spine. If the tumor is benign (non-cancerous), it can be removed by doing surgery. In case the tumor is cancerous, radiation therapy may be required. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, PMC-LLaMA. Ly/",1. The remaining tumors can be treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy. 2. I would like to see his MRI and other reports. 3.

If your daughter has Turner's syndrome, and she has developed normally, got her period, and is pregnant with identical twins, then her children may not be affected by the condition.","Yes, it is possible for a child with Turner syndrome to have parents with a normal genetic makeup.  Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of only one X chromosome in some or all of the cells in the body.  The condition is usually diagnosed at birth, but sometimes it is not detected until later in life.  Turner syndrome affects about 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 females in the United States.  A child with Turner syndrome may have a variety of physical and developmental features, including a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, and heart and kidney problems.  Many girls with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence, but learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder are common.  Turner syndrome also affects sexual development.  Most girls with Turner syndrome have underdeveloped ovaries and do not menstruate.  However, some girls with Turner syndrome have normal ovaries and menstruate normally.  Women with Turner syndrome have a higher risk of certain health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and thyroid disorders.  They also have a higher risk of some types of cancer, such as lymphoma and leukemia.  Turner syndrome is not inherited, but the genetic change that causes it can be passed from parent to child.  This genetic change most often occurs because of a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in one of the parents.  If one of the parent's egg or sperm cell has the genetic change, there is a 50 percent chance that the child will inherit it.  If the child has the genetic change, there is a 50 percent chance he or she will pass it on to each of his or her children.",1. The risk of recurrence of Turner's syndrome is 1/4 in each pregnancy.2.

If you don't have easy access to the Internet, you can contact the reference librarian at your local public library or a medical library in your area.  They should be able to provide you with the information you need.","1. The first place to look for information about a health condition is PubMed, a free website provided by the National Library of Medicine.  You can type in the name of the condition or the name of a drug and get a list of articles about that topic.  The articles are listed by relevance or how often they have been cited by other articles or scientists.  Keep in mind that some information may be out of date, but this is a good place to start.  Here is an example of how to search for information about autism:  PubMed.  Other databases you may want to try include:  CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature)  PsycINFO (Psychological Information, Including Abstracts and Citations)  MEDLINE (MEDLARS) (Citations for articles from more than 4,000 biomedical journals) 2. If you do not find what you need on PubMed, try searching the websites of specific organizations.  Here are some websites you can search for information about autism:  Autism Speaks  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  National Institute of Mental Health  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 3. Another source of information is the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia.  You can search for information about autism on Wikipedia by using the terms ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" or ""Autism"".  Keep in mind that anyone can contribute to Wikipedia, so the information may not always be accurate. 4. If you still cannot find what you need, try contacting a local university or medical school library.  Librarians can help you locate information on almost any topic."
"1. Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. I am PMC-LLaMA. 2. HIV/AIDS is a disease caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which attacks and weakens the immune system. 3. When the immune system is weakened, it is unable to protect the body from infections and certain cancers.4. Without treatment, people with HIV/AIDS will typically experience a decline in their immune system leading to the development of opportunistic infections.5. These infections can be severe and life-threatening.6. HIV/AIDS treatment is aimed at suppressing the virus and slowing or stopping its progression to AIDS.7. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the treatment of choice for HIV/AIDS.8. ART is a combination of two or more drugs that work together to prevent HIV replication and to slow progression to AIDS.9. HIV/AIDS treatment should be taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor.10. Missed doses can increase the risk of developing drug-resistant HIV.11. If you have difficulty taking your medication as prescribed, talk to your doctor.12. HIV/AIDS treatment does not cure HIV/AIDS, but it can help to control the infection.13. As long as you take HIV/AIDS treatment regularly, you can live a long and healthy life.14. If you have any concerns about your HIV/AIDS treatment, talk to your doctor.15. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.16. In case of any doubt, I will be available for follow-ups.

Is there anything else I should know?","1. The standard of care for HIV/AIDS treatment is antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is a combination of three or more drugs that suppress HIV replication and prevent the development of drug resistance. 2. The choice of drugs and the specific regimen depends on several factors, including the patient's previous treatment history, the results of the plasma HIV RNA level, the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or active substance abuse. 3. Regimens should be chosen that are potent, with low probability of development of resistance, and that have the lowest probability of causing clinically significant adverse effects. 4. The most frequently used regimens consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in combination with either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). 5. The currently recommended guidelines for initiation of ART are summarized in Table 1. 6. Common side effects of ART include gastrointestinal symptoms, lipodystrophy, and various neurologic problems. Less frequently observed toxicities include cardiovascular and renal effects and various blood abnormalities. 7. Patients who are ART-naive and have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts <500 cells/mm3 should receive a regimen containing two NRTIs and either a PI or an NNRTI. The preferred regimen is two NRTIs plus a PI. 8. Patients who are ART-naive and have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts >500 cells/mm3 should receive a regimen containing two NRTIs and an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). The preferred regimen is two NRTIs plus an INSTI. 9. The preferred PI in treatment-naive patients is ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. The preferred NNRTI is efavirenz. 10. The preferred INSTI is raltegravir. 11. The most frequent N","1. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard treatment for HIV infection. It involves taking a combination of medications that stop the virus from replicating and infecting new cells. 2. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (called the viral load) to a level that is so low that the virus cannot be detected in a plasma viral load test. 3. The combination of medications is usually made up of three or more drugs, which are usually a combination of: * Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) * Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) * Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) * Protease inhibitors (PIs) * Integrase inhibitors (IIs) 4. The choice of medications is based on a number of factors, including which class of drugs the person has not yet taken, how much HIV is in the blood (viral load), and the person's medical history and any other medical conditions they have. 5. The medications are usually taken as a combination of three or more drugs, which are usually a combination of: * Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) * Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) * Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) * Protease inhibitors (PIs) * Integrase inhibitors (IIs) 6.

HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system and reduces the body's ability to fight infections. 2. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection caused by HIV. Not all HIV-positive people develop AIDS. 3. If you have HIV/AIDS, you can take antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to keep your virus levels low. This helps to prevent the virus from damaging your immune system. 4. ARV drugs don't cure HIV/AIDS, but they help to control the infection. 5. If you have HIV/AIDS, you should see a doctor regularly. They will help you to manage your symptoms and prevent the disease from getting worse. 6. If you are taking ARV drugs, you should never stop taking them. If you do, your virus levels may increase and you may develop AIDS complications.","1. HIV/AIDS treatment aims to suppress the virus and prevent it from replicating. 2.

The choice of medications depends on factors like the patient's age, CD4 count, viral load, and comorbidities like hepatitis B or C. 5. Treatment is recommended for all individuals living with HIV, regardless of their CD4 count or symptoms. 6. The goal of treatment is to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load, which means that the virus is suppressed to levels below the limit of detection. 7. Adherence to ART is critical, as nonadherence can lead to the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV. 8. Adherence can be promoted through patient education, simplification of treatment regimens, and social support."

Yes, sepsis can be acquired in a hospital setting.","1) Sepsis cannot be avoided, but its development can be slowed down or prevented through early identification of the condition and prompt treatment. 2) Sepsis is not considered a hospital-acquired condition.","Sepsis is a serious condition that can affect anyone. It is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy patients, and people who have had an organ transplant. It is also more common in older adults and in people with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and kidney or liver disease.  Preventing sepsis begins with preventing the transmission of GNB from one patient to another. Hand washing is the single most important way to prevent the spread of GNB. Healthcare providers who wash their hands between patient contacts can reduce the spread of GNB. Using alcohol-based hand sanitizers instead of soap and water may also help prevent the spread of GNB.  Some cases of sepsis can be prevented by vaccinating people at risk for certain types of infection. The flu vaccine, for example, can help prevent cases of pneumonia and the serious blood infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.",1) Sepsis is preventable condition. 2) Sepsis can be transmitted in hospital environment.,"Sepsis is a condition that can be life-threatening. It is a serious infection that can happen in the body when an overwhelming bacterial or fungal infection is present. Sepsis can happen to anyone, but it is more common in people who are already sick or in people who have had surgery, a long illness, or a long stay in the hospital. It is a medical emergency. If you have sepsis, you need to be treated quickly. Sepsis can be prevented by avoiding infections. If you are already sick or in the hospital, make sure your doctor knows about it.

It is a personal choice and the government should not intervene. 6)The number one thing to cut out of your diet is trans fat. It is found in processed foods and is extremely unhealthy.","1) The rise of obesity is due to a combination of factors including the increased availability of cheap, high-calorie food and the decreased physical activity levels of many Americans. 2) A junk food tax would likely be effective in reducing obesity rates because it would increase the cost of unhealthy foods and hopefully encourage consumers to choose healthier options. 3) Preventing obesity requires a multipronged approach including education about healthy eating and exercise habits, making healthy foods more readily available than unhealthy ones, and creating more opportunities for physical activity. 4) The advantages of engaging in 30 minutes of daily exercise and a healthy diet include improved physical fitness, weight loss, decreased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, and overall improved health and well-being. 5) The government should play a significant role in combating obesity by enacting policies that encourage healthy eating and","1) Lack of physical activity and poor eating habits are the primary causes of obesity. 2) No, I do not think that imposing a tax on unhealthy foods will lead to a decrease in obesity cases because most unhealthy foods are not that expensive. 3) Obesity can be prevented by encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity at an early age. 4) Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help maintain a healthy body weight, improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of developing certain cancers, lower the risk of diabetes and heart disease, improve mood and self-esteem, and reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis. 5) Yes, the government should take a more active role in addressing the obesity epidemic by encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity at an early age, providing better access to healthy foods, and making healthy foods more affordable. 6) We should prioritize reducing our intake of sugary foods and drinks.","1. The factors that contribute most to the prevalence of obesity are the types of food we eat, the amount of physical activity we do, and our genetic makeup. 2. A tax on junk food may encourage some people to avoid these foods, but it will not help the people who are least likely to eat healthy foods: poor people. 3. Preventing obesity means teaching children and adults about the importance of eating healthy foods and getting regular exercise. It also means helping people make healthy food choices when shopping or eating at restaurants. 4. The advantages of regular exercise and a healthy diet include a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. 5. The government should be involved in efforts to combat obesity by supporting research into the causes of obesity and ways to prevent and treat it. The government should also work to improve access to healthy foods and increase opportunities for physical activity in communities. 6. The most important dietary change we can make to reduce obesity is to eat more fruits and vegetables.","1) The main causes of obesity are overeating and lack of exercise. Obesity is also affected by genetics, certain medications, and health conditions that may cause obesity. 2) I do not think a tax on unhealthy foods will help reduce obesity. People who are already obese will find ways around the tax and people who are not obese will not change their eating habits. 3) Preventing obesity means eating healthy and getting enough exercise. It also means not eating too much. 4) Exercising for 30 minutes daily and eating a healthy diet helps you lose weight and stay healthy. It also helps prevent diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. 5) The government should not play a bigger role in addressing obesity. People need to take responsibility for their own health and make their own lifestyle choices. 6) We should limit our intake of fast foods and processed foods. We should also avoid sugary drinks and high-calorie alcoholic beverages.","1. The growing obesity problem is due to the sedentary lifestyle of people, the availability of junk food, and the lack of awareness about the ill effects of obesity. 2. Taxing junk food will not reduce obesity rates because people will find ways to get junk food through other means. 3. Prevent obesity by educating people about the ill effects of obesity and making healthy food available at reasonable prices. 4. Regular exercise improves the cardiovascular health and helps burn calories. A balanced diet provides all the nutrients required by the body. 5. The government should take a prominent role in combating obesity by making healthy food available at subsidized rates and by providing facilities for physical activity. 6. We should reduce the intake of junk food and encourage people to indulge in physical activity."

Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. These genes are involved in a process called mismatch repair. This process corrects errors that occur during DNA replication. When mismatch repair does not work correctly, errors can build up in the DNA. This can lead to gene mutations, which can cause cancer. 3. The most common symptom of Lynch syndrome is abnormal bowel habits, such as diarrhea and constipation. Other symptoms can include stomach pain, nausea, and bleeding from the rectum. People with Lynch syndrome usually do not have any symptoms related to their increased risk of cancer until cancer develops. 4. Genetic testing can be used to detect whether a person has a mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes. A blood sample or a sample of tumor tissue from a person with cancer can be tested. 5. There is no cure for Lynch syndrome. However, colon and rectal cancers can be found early by doing regular screening tests. If cancer is found early, the chances for a cure are higher.

"Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It is more common in African Americans than in whites and tends to occur at an earlier age in African Americans.  Glaucoma is usually caused by increased pressure in the eye. This increased pressure is called intraocular pressure. The high pressure can damage the optic nerve. It can cause changes in the eye that can result in vision loss.  There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are open-angle and narrow-angle.  Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type. It is chronic (long-lasting), and usually develops slowly over time.  Narrow-angle glaucoma, also called angle-closure glaucoma, is less common. It comes on quickly and is an emergency.  Some people are at higher risk for developing glaucoma. These include  African Americans over age 40 People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans People with a family history of glaucoma The doctor will use one or more of the following tests to diagnose glaucoma:  - Ophthalmoscopy (eye exam)  - Tonometry to measure eye pressure  - Gonioscopy to examine the angle where the iris meets the cornea  - OCT (optical coherence tomography) to measure the optic nerve  - Visual field testing to check for blind spots  - A dilated eye exam to look at the inside of the eye  - Other tests, such as a slit lamp exam or a corneal pachymeter test","Yes, glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. However, glaucoma may not cause any symptoms until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. That's why it is important to have regular comprehensive eye exams so your eye doctor can detect any changes in the optic nerve. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Glaucoma is usually diagnosed by measuring the pressure in the eye. Your eye doctor places a small instrument on your eye to measure the fluid pressure inside the eye. This is called the ""tonometry"" test.  Your eye doctor may also examine the inside of the eye and look for signs of glaucoma. To get a clearer picture of what is happening in your eye, your doctor may also perform other tests. These may include:  - Gonioscopy - A test that uses a special magnifying lens to examine the angle between the iris and the cornea.  - Ophthalmoscopy - A test that uses an ophthalmoscope to examine the inside of the eye.  - Perimetry - A test that measures how well light passes through the eye to the retina.  - Slit lamp exam - A test that uses a narrow beam of light to illuminate the inside of the eye.  - Ultrasonography - A test that uses sound waves to examine the inside of the eye.  - Visual field testing - A test that measures how well a person sees at various distances.  - Other diagnostic procedures - These may include interviews, evaluations, or consultations.  Your eye doctor will discuss treatment options with you. These may include prescription eyedrops, glaucoma surgery, or other treatments.  NIH: National Eye Institute","1.

Another type, acute angle-closure glaucoma, is an emergency and must be treated immediately. 4. Open-angle glaucoma is a chronic disease that often has no symptoms. It can cause permanent vision loss if it is not treated. 5. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency and must be treated immediately. Symptoms include severe eye pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and a rapid rise in eye pressure. 6. The most common treatment for open-angle glaucoma is prescription eyedrops. 7. The most common side effects of glaucoma eyedrops are eye redness, eye irritation, blurred vision, and dry eyes. 8. If you have open-angle glaucoma, you should also get a complete eye exam and eye tests at least once every two years. 9. You should also learn how to take care of your eyes. This includes using eyedrops or wearing eye patches, using a special type of eyedrops, and/or undergoing laser surgery. 10. If you have acute angle-closure glaucoma, you should go to the emergency room or an urgent care center for immediate treatment.","Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Here are some facts about glaucoma.   Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It is estimated that 2.5 million people in the United States have glaucoma.  Of these, 1.3 million have the open-angle form of the disease and 800,000 have the narrow-angle form.  Glaucoma is more common in African Americans than in white Americans.  Glaucoma is more common as people age. About 2% of the population over age 40 has open-angle glaucoma, and about 10% over age 80 has the disease.  Glaucoma is usually caused by increased pressure in the eye. This increased pressure is called intraocular pressure.  In narrow-angle glaucoma, this pressure increase occurs suddenly. In open-angle glaucoma, the pressure increase develops gradually over a long period of time.  Some people with increased pressure in the eye will not develop glaucoma. Often, there are no symptoms. That's why glaucoma is called the silent thief of sight.  The increased pressure can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. If the nerve is damaged by increased pressure, vision loss and blindness may result.  Some people will develop glaucoma in their 20s and 30s. Others will not develop the disease until their 60s and 70s.  Glaucoma is usually diagnosed with a comprehensive eye exam. This exam includes testing your visual acuity (sharpness of vision), checking your pupils, and measuring your intraocular pressure.  Treatment for glaucoma is aimed at reducing intraocular pressure. The most common treatments are prescription eye drops, surgery, and laser treatments.  With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.

In the United States, open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of the disease. 6. In the eye, a clear fluid flows in and out of the chamber. This fluid leaves the eye through a special drainage system. When the drainage system is blocked, fluid pressure builds up in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure. Over time, this pressure can damage the optic nerve. It can cause gradual loss of peripheral and central vision. 7. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly. There may be no symptoms at first. People with the disease often do not notice changes in their vision until the disease has caused significant vision loss. This is why it is important to have regular eye exams. 8.

"21.6 mg/d is high for a 24 hour urine collection.  Normal is 7.0 to 17.0 mg/d.  Your son may have Cushing's Syndrome.  The best way to determine if it is muscle waste is to have him get a DEXA scan.  This will tell you if he has lost bone density due to the muscle wasting.  Also, a test called an EMG can be done to see if he has muscle wasting.  This test is done by a neurologist.  Finally, a test called a muscle biopsy can be done to see if there is a problem with the muscles.  This test is done by a surgeon.",24-hour urine creatinine excretion is a screening test for cushing syndrome. A value of 21.6 mg/24hours is definitely on the higher side and should be investigated.

You need to consult a physician who will get other tests done to confirm or rule out cushing syn PMC-LLaMA.  I hope this answers your question.,"1. High creatinine levels in the blood and/or high levels of creatinine in a 24-hour urine collection suggest that a person has a high muscle mass. 2. Creatinine is a waste product that is produced continuously by the body as muscles break down. 3. The amount of creatinine in the blood or urine depends on the amount of muscle mass a person has. 4. In people with low muscle mass, such as those with muscle wasting or malnutrition, lower-than-normal creatinine levels are seen. 5. A high creatinine level in the blood or high levels of creatinine in a 24-hour urine collection may mean that a person has a high muscle mass. 6. For example, athletes have higher-than-normal creatinine levels because they have more muscle mass than the average person. 7. In addition, creatinine levels may be high in people who have kidney disease because their kidneys are not able to effectively remove creatinine from the blood. 8. Therefore, high creatinine levels in the blood or high levels of creatinine in a 24-hour urine collection may be due to muscle wasting, or they may be due to kidney disease.","1. A high creatinine level in the blood means that there is less creatinine being passed by the kidneys into the urine. 2. The blood creatinine level is used to assess how well the kidneys are working. 3. If the creatinine level is higher than normal, it means that the kidneys are not working as well as they should be. 4. A high creatinine level in the blood can mean that you have chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury. 5. The blood creatinine level may also be high if you have a condition that causes rapid muscle breakdown, such as severe burns, muscle diseases, or an injury. 6. The blood creatinine level is usually higher in people with liver disease than in those without. 7. If you have liver disease, your body does not process creatinine normally. 8. This means that your blood creatinine level will be falsely high. 9. Liver disease is not the only cause of a high creatinine level in the blood. 10. Other conditions that can cause a high creatinine level include muscle diseases, kidney disorders, and acute kidney injury. 11. The blood creatinine level is usually higher in men than in women and is also higher as people get older. 12.

You have not mentioned your age, gender, alcoholic or not, any medication ongoing, any other associated disease present or not.2. Bilirubin is a yellow colored pigment, produced as an end product of heme degradation. It is conjugated with glucuronic acid, to form bilirubin glucuronide, which is water soluble. Bilirubin glucuronide is excreted into bile, and reaches the intestine. In the intestine, it is hydrolyzed by bacteria, to form unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water soluble, and is bound to albumin for its excretion.3. Normally, in healthy individuals, unconjugated bilirubin accounts for about 10-20% of the total bilirubin.4. In case of any liver disease, conjugated bilirubin is elevated, as it is not conjugated by liver.5. In case of any hemolytic anemia, the breakdown of RBC releases large amount of heme, which is metabolized to bilirubin, and hence, there is an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin.6. In your case, since there is no other associated disease, it is most likely due to hemolytic anemia.7. You should get a complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, reticulocyte count, serum LDH, serum haptoglobin, urine urobilinogen, serum bilirubin (total and fraction), and serum albumin.8.

The best predictor of future function is the present level of function.5. If your child is able to sit, walk and talk, he will be able to function normally as an adult.","Polymicrogyria is a condition in which too many small gyri (bumps) are found on the surface of the brain. It is a structural abnormality that is present from birth. It can be caused by a variety of factors. In some cases, the cause is unknown. Polymicrogyria is usually diagnosed by brain imaging tests. There is no cure for polymicrogyria, but treatments can help specific symptoms.  The symptoms of polymicrogyria vary from person to person. They can include:  - intellectual disability  - seizures  - spasticity or weakness of the limbs  - vision problems  - hearing problems  - speech problems  - developmental delay  - feeding problems","Polymicrogyria is a disorder of brain development that results in an abnormal appearance of the brain. The abnormality is due to an over folding or buckling of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain. The folding pattern seen on the surface of the brain is known as the gyri and sulci.  The folding pattern seen in the affected brain appears as too many small gyri (known as microgyria) and too many sulci (known as polymicrogyria).  The abnormality is usually found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.  The cause of this disorder is unknown.  Most cases are thought to be due to genetic factors.  The disorder is usually diagnosed by MRI scan.  There is no specific treatment for this disorder.  Treatment is aimed at controlling seizures and providing supportive care.  The outcome for affected individuals is variable.  Many individuals have developmental delay and mental retardation.  However, some individuals have mild symptoms and function normally.","Polymicrogyria is a disorder of brain development that is characterized by an excessive number of small gyri in the cerebral cortex. It is usually the result of mutations in genes that regulate brain development. Symptoms vary widely among affected individuals and may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, spasticity, and deafness. The term ""polymicrogyria"" literally means ""many small convolutions."" However, the abnormality is not limited to the convolutions (bumps on the outer surface of the brain). It also involves the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the connections between the different layers of the cortex, and the structures in the white matter below the cortex. Polymicrogyria is usually not present at birth but develops over the first 2 years of life. It is most commonly diagnosed in children between 6 months and 2 years of age. The severity of the disorder varies from mild to severe. Polymicrogyria is usually not associated with abnormalities of the head or face. In most cases, however, the head is smaller than normal, and the face appears small and triangular. The eyes may be widely spaced, and the forehead may be narrow. The tongue may be small, and the second toe and third toe may be longer than normal. In many cases, the diagnosis of polymicrogyria is made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Although there is no cure for polymicrogyria, early diagnosis and treatment may improve the outcome. Treatment may include medications for seizures, physical therapy, and special education. In some cases, surgery may be helpful.","Polymicrogyria is a rare disorder of the brain in which too many small gyri (bumps on the surface of the brain) are present. Polymicrogyria can cause severe developmental delay, but some children have milder forms of the disorder.

Treatment is often focused on seizure control.","Polymicrogyria is a disorder of brain development that is characterized by an excessive number of small gyri in the cerebral cortex. It is often associated with developmental delay, mental retardation, and epilepsy. The term ""multicystic encephalomalacia"" has been used to describe this condition, but it is not correct because encephalomalacia is an abnormality of brain tissue that is soft and spongy, whereas polymicrogyria is an abnormality of brain structure. Polymicrogyria is present at birth, but it may not be recognized until later in life when it becomes apparent that a child is not meeting appropriate developmental milestones. Polymicrogyria is usually diagnosed after careful examination of an MRI scan. The MRI scan shows a brain with numerous small gyri. The gyri are often irregular and may be slit-like or sulcus-like.  The diagnosis of polymicrogyria is based on the appearance of the MRI scan and the clinical findings. There is no specific treatment for polymicrogyria. Treatment is directed at the specific symptoms that are present. For example, seizures may be controlled with medication. Children with polymicrogyria often have developmental delays in motor skills. Physical and occupational therapy may help improve these delays. Children with polymicrogyria should be cared for by a team of specialists including a neurologist, a neuropsychologist, and a developmental pediatrician.  The prognosis for individuals with polymicrogyria depends on the severity of the condition and the extent of the associated abnormalities. Children with mild cases may have normal or near-normal intelligence. Children with severe cases of polymicrogyria with multiple other abnormalities may have mental retardation."

"Yes, macular degeneration in only one eye can cause dizziness.  The macula is the central part of the retina. It is responsible for sharp, central vision. Macular degeneration is a condition in which the macula slowly breaks down, leading to a loss of central vision. This can make it hard to do things like read or drive.  Macular degeneration usually comes on slowly. There are two types of macular degeneration: wet and dry.  Wet macular degeneration is the more severe form. It is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina.  Dry macular degeneration is caused by the slow breakdown of cells in the macula. This type of macular degeneration is much more common than wet macular degeneration.  People with macular degeneration in only one eye may not notice any change in their vision. They may have vision problems only when they are trying to do things like read or drive.  As macular degeneration gets worse, people have more trouble seeing in low light. They may also notice that they can't see as many colors. Some people also notice that straight lines look wavy.  Macular degeneration does not affect side (peripheral) vision. This means that people with macular degeneration can usually still see out of the corner of their eye.  Because macular degeneration only affects central vision, it usually does not cause dizziness. However, some people with macular degeneration in only one eye may have dizziness, because they have problems with balance when they move their head. This is due to a loss of depth perception.  The loss of central vision may also make it harder to see steps or other changes in the surface of the ground. This can lead to falls and other injuries.","1. No, it does not cause dizziness. 2.

"1. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is metabolized mainly by the liver to acetaminophen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates which are excreted in the urine. 2. Aspirin is mainly metabolized by the liver to form salicylate which is subsequently converted to salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is further conjugated with glycine to form salicylate-glycine which is excreted in the urine. 3. In a patient with a history of peptic ulcers, if acetaminophen is administered, it may cause gastric irritation and peptic ulceration due to the fact that it is metabolized to a small extent to a toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) which is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione in the liver. However, in a patient with gastric ulcers, this detoxification process is hindered, and NAPQI accumulates which causes gastric toxicity. Aspirin on the other hand, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which can cause gastric ulcers and bleeding.

"1. Periventricular heterotopia is a malformation of cortical development characterized by abnormally placed gray matter near the lateral ventricles. It is commonly associated with mental retardation and epilepsy. 2. The genetics of periventricular heterotopia are poorly understood. The condition is sporadic in most cases, and only a few familial cases have been reported. 3. The most common genetic abnormality associated with this condition is trisomy 18. 4. Other genetic abnormalities associated with periventricular heterotopia include trisomy 13, trisomy 21, tetrasomy 9, and deletions of 17p13 and 17p15. 5. In addition to genetic abnormalities, several environmental factors have been associated with an increased risk of periventricular heterotopia, including maternal diabetes and alcohol use during pregnancy. 6. The clinical features of periventricular heterotopia are variable. Most affected individuals have intellectual disability and epilepsy. The severity of intellectual disability varies from mild to profound. Epilepsy is usually severe and often refractory to medical treatment. 7. The most common motor findings are spastic diparesis and dystonia. Other motor findings include ataxia, choreoathetosis, and spastic quadriparesis. 8. Vision impairment, hearing loss, and dental abnormalities are also common features. 9. Renal abnormalities are present in a small percentage of individuals with periventricular heterotopia. 10. Survival beyond early childhood is uncommon in individuals with periventricular heterotopia. Death usually occurs during the first two decades of life and is most often due to complications of seizures or status epilepticus. 11. In individuals with periventricular heterotopia who survive into adolescence or adulthood, the neurologic findings are similar to those in individuals with epilepsy and intellectual disability of unknown cause. 12. Scoliosis is a common feature of periventricular heterotopia. The pre","1) Periventricular Heterotopia is a malformation of the brain that occurs due to abnormal development during embryogenesis. 2) Idiopathic scoliosis is a 3-dimensional deformity of the spine that is generally without a known cause. 3) There is one report of 3 siblings with Periventricular Heterotopia who also had idiopathic scoliosis. 4) The authors concluded that there was likely a genetic correlation between the conditions. 5) However, there have been no other reports of genetic correlations between Periventricular Heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis.","1. Periventricular Heterotopia (PVH) is a malformation of the brain characterized by nodular heterotopia in the periventricular white matter. 2. PVH is usually diagnosed in childhood and is associated with a high incidence of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, developmental delay, and mental retardation. 3. The incidence of severe idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is also high in patients with PVH. 4. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl with PVH and IS. 5. This is the first description of a possible relationship between these two conditions.","1. Periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is a malformation of the brain that results from problems with the development of the brain during embryogenesis. 2. The genetic basis of PVH is heterogeneous, and causative genes have been identified in only a small percentage of patients. 3. The most common genes associated with PVH are located on the X chromosome (ARX, ARID1B, and MIER3), and mutations in these genes are associated with a distinctive phenotype in both males and females. 4. The phenotype includes mental retardation, epilepsy, and spasticity, in addition to the brain malformations. 5. The spinal deformity idiopathic scoliosis is not recognized as being correlated with Periventricular Heterotopia.","1. Periventricular Heterotopia is a genetic disorder that is associated with a wide range of neurological symptoms. 2. It is also associated with a variety of skeletal abnormalities including idiopathic scoliosis. 3. There is a strong genetic component to Periventricular Heterotopia and idiopathic scoliosis. 4. This means that there is a higher incidence of scoliosis in families with a history of Periventricular Heterotopia. 5. The exact mechanism by which Periventricular Heterotopia causes scoliosis is not known. 6. However, it is believed that the condition affects the muscles around the spine which can result in abnormal curvature of the spine. 7. In some cases, the scoliosis associated with Periventricular Heterotopia is believed to be secondary to abnormal growth of the long bones. 8. Other symptoms of Periventricular Heterotopia include seizures, developmental delay, mental retardation, microcephaly, spasticity, and optic atrophy.","1. Periventricular Heterotopia is a genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. 2. The mutations that cause this condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. 3. In most cases, the disorder is caused by mutations in the XLIS gene. However, mutations in the XLIS gene account for only about half of the cases. 4. The XLIS gene provides instructions for making a protein called Lis1. This protein plays a role in the migration of nerve cells during fetal development. Researchers believe that abnormalities in the protein may disrupt the normal migration of nerve cells, resulting in Periventricular Heterotopia. 5. In some cases, the disorder is caused by mutations in the XLID gene. The XLID gene provides instructions for making a protein called DCL. This protein is involved in the migration of nerve cells during fetal development. Researchers believe that abnormalities in the protein may disrupt the normal migration of nerve cells, resulting in Periventricular Heterotopia. 6. In rare cases, the disorder is caused by mutations in the FLNA gene. The FLNA gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin-A. This protein is involved in the structure and function of cells in the body. Researchers believe that abnormalities in the protein may disrupt the structure and function of cells, resulting in Periventricular Heterotopia. 7. In rare cases, the disorder is caused by mutations in the ARX gene. The ARX gene provides instructions for making a protein called aristaless related homeobox protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Researchers believe that abnormalities in the protein may disrupt the regulation of gene expression, resulting in Periventricular Heterotopia. 8. In rare cases, the disorder is caused by mutations in the DCX gene. The DCX gene also provides instructions for making a protein called double homeobox protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Researchers believe that abnormalities in the protein may disrupt the regulation of gene expression"

ART does not cure HIV infection; people who begin ART while their CD4 count is still normal live longer than those who begin treatment after their CD4 count has dropped to very low levels.3. The standard of care for HIV treatment involves using a combination of at least three different drugs. This is because the use of a combination of drugs reduces the risk of the virus developing resistance to the medications.4. The combination of drugs is usually made up of at least one protease inhibitor (PI), which is usually combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).5. There are five classes of drugs that are used to treat HIV infection.6. The five classes of HIV drugs are: NRTIs, PIs, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNI), a fusion inhibitor, and a integrase inhibitor.7. A person's medications are chosen based on the results of a genotypic resistance test, which is a test that looks for mutations in the virus that would make it resistant to particular medications.8. The most common side effects of HIV medications involve problems with the nerves (neuropathy) and changes in body fat.9. The most serious side effect of some HIV medications is the development of a fat loss condition called wasting.10. Other side effects of HIV medications include: nausea, headache, and dizziness; changes in body fat; and liver damage.","1. HIV treatment consists of antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is a combination of three or more medicines that stop HIV from multiplying in the body. 2. The aim of HIV treatment is to reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a level which is so low that the virus cannot damage the immune system. 3. Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the amount of HIV in the body is kept low. 4. The earlier HIV is treated, the better the outcome. Treatment should be started as soon as possible after HIV is diagnosed. 5. It is important to take HIV treatment regularly, every day, without missing doses, to increase the chances of treatment success. 6. If HIV treatment is not taken regularly, or if the amount of HIV in the body increases, the immune system may be damaged, and the person may develop AIDS. 7.

This is a combination of 3 or more medicines that stop HIV from reproducing. 2) The most common side effects of ART are nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache. These side effects can be reduced by taking the medicines with food, and by slowly increasing the dose. 3) The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to ""undetectable"" levels. This means that the virus cannot be found with a highly sensitive test. A patient is considered to have ""successful"" treatment if the amount of HIV in their blood is undetectable. 4) The most important thing a patient can do to help their treatment be successful is to take their medicines exactly as directed. This means taking them on time, every day, without missing any doses.","Hi, I'm PMC-LLaMA.  I'm an HIV specialist and I'd be happy to answer your question.  HIV positive trans women should be treated with anti-retroviral therapy just like any other HIV positive person.  The goal of treatment is to bring the HIV virus under control and to prevent the development of AIDS.  Treatment usually consists of a combination of 3 or more different medications.  The choice of medications will depend on a number of factors including the person's CD4 count and HIV viral load, any co-existing illnesses, and other factors.

The choice of medications will depend on a number of factors including the person's CD4 count and HIV viral load, any co-existing illnesses, and other factors.  The medications are generally very well tolerated, but some people may experience side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, or changes in lipid levels.  In addition, some medications may have an effect on bone density and can increase the risk of developing osteoporosis.  Regular monitoring for side effects is an important part of treatment.  In addition, people with HIV should be regularly screened for co-existing illnesses such as Hepatitis C or depression, since these conditions are more common in people with HIV than in the general population.  It's also important for people with HIV to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly to help maintain their overall health.  I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions.","As a trans woman myself I can say that there are a lot of barriers to care. A lot of trans women don't see themselves as being at risk for HIV. They don't see themselves as women, they see themselves as men. So they don't think they need to be on HIV medication. They also don't want to go to clinics where they're going to be called ""sir"" or ""Mr."" or ""man."" They want to be called by their female pronouns. So creating a safe space for trans women to access care is very important. Also, a lot of trans women have a history of incarceration and drug use. Many have been in prison and have been exposed to HIV in prison. They may have mental health issues, homelessness issues, and all of these things make it difficult for them to access care. So creating a welcoming environment that's non-judgmental and understanding of their lives is very important.","1. HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system. It is caused by the HIV virus. 2. The goal of HIV/AIDS treatment is to lower the amount of HIV in the blood to a level that is too low to cause further health problems. 3. HIV/AIDS treatment can keep the virus from damaging the immune system. It can also help reduce the risk of spreading HIV to others. 4. HIV/AIDS treatment involves taking medicines, called antiretroviral drugs. 5. People may need to take more than one medicine. They should always take their HIV/AIDS medicines exactly as instructed. 6. Some antiretroviral medicines have side effects, so it's important to talk to a doctor if side effects are bothersome. 7. People with HIV/AIDS should see a health care provider regularly. 8. People with HIV/AIDS may need support and assistance with everyday tasks."

People with fibromyalgia may also have painful ""trigger points"" in their muscles. Trigger points are small, hard, painful areas in the muscles and in the joints. 4. People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as: 5. Tingling or numbness in hands and feet. 6. Problems with memory and concentration. 7. A feeling of liquid running through or popping in the joints. 8. Headaches. 9. Painful menstrual periods. 10. Problems with the bowels, bladder, or both. 11. Fibromyalgia is not caused by injury or infection. 12. It is not a form of arthritis. 13. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. 14. People with fibromyalgia may have chemical imbalances in the brain. This causes the brain to release too much of certain substances that cause pain. 15. Fibromyalgia is more common in people with: 16. Depression. 17. Anxiety. 18. Rheumatoid arthritis. 19. Fibromyalgia is not contagious. 20. There is no known way to prevent fibromyalgia. 21. Fibromyalgia is a long-term illness. 22. Treatment can help control symptoms.","1. Hypertension is high blood pressure. It means that your blood is pushing against your artery walls with too much force. Hypertension is called the silent killer because it often has no symptoms. But it can lead to stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure.2. Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome in which a person has long-term pain, spread throughout the body. The pain is most often linked to fatigue, sleep problems, headaches, depression, and anxiety. 3. Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat and is the main source of energy for your body. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. 4. You can use search terms like ""hypertension"" or ""fibromyalgia"" to get more specific results.","1) Because the search term you entered was ""hypertension"" and not ""high blood pressure"", which is a common synonym for hypertension. 2) Because high blood pressure is a risk factor for diabetes, so it makes sense that a search for hypertension would turn up information on diabetes. 3) Because fibromyalgia is a relatively rare condition and there isn't as much research on it as there is on hypertension and diabetes.","1. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and it is estimated that 65 million Americans have this condition. 2. Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. 3. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. These are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them. 4. People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as tingling or numbness in hands and feet, sleep problems, and problems with memory and concentration. 5. Fibromyalgia is not an inflammatory disease, and so it does not cause joint damage or deformity. 6. Fibromyalgia is often associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and temporomandibular joint disorder. 7. People with fibromyalgia have some other health problems that may be related to stress, such as anxiety and depression. 8. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but medicine can help you manage your symptoms. 9. Exercise, stress management, and a healthy diet are also important. 10. A combination of medicines, exercise, and lifestyle changes will help you manage your fibromyalgia.",1) Go to PubMed and in the query box type in hypertension and fibromyalgia.

"1. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes, including peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes). 2. The condition has autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. 3. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever has been identified as MEFV, located on chromosome 16. 4. The condition is more common in individuals of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. 5. Males and females are equally affected. 6. In FMF, the episodes of fever and serositis are associated with pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. 7. The episodes usually last for 12 to 72 hours, and are associated with fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy. 8. The attacks are usually followed by a symptom-free interval of weeks to months, until the next attack. 9. Between the attacks, the patients may have arthritis of knees or ankles, and some patients may have rashes. 10. Long-standing inflammation of the serous membranes may result in adhesions of the intestines, and/or amyloidosis. 11. In children, the first attack of FMF is often a febrile illness that is associated with a rash. 12. In adults, the first attack is often associated with serositis (pleurisy, peritonitis, or arthritis). 13. A few patients develop a condition called hyperammonaemia type II, with chronic liver involvement. 14. Patients with FMF have a higher risk of developing amyloidosis. 15. The diagnosis of FMF is based on the following criteria: a. Recurrent episodes of fever and serositis b. Exclusion of other causes of recurrent fever and serositis c.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a condition that causes episodes of fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. Attacks can be triggered by physical activity, stress, or injury. The first attack often occurs in childhood or the teen years. Attacks may occur as often as once a week or once a year. Attacks usually last 1 to 3 days. 2. What causes FMF?  FMF is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a gene for FMF, there is a 25% chance of the child having the condition. FMF is most common in people of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. 3. What are the symptoms of FMF?  FMF is characterized by attacks of fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. The attacks are often accompanied by a rash. Some people have attacks triggered by stress, physical activity, or injury. Attacks can last 1 to 3 days. Between attacks, many people have some pain in their abdomen or joints. 4. How is FMF diagnosed?  There is no specific test for FMF. FMF is often diagnosed by ruling out other conditions that cause similar symptoms. 5. How is FMF treated?  There is no cure for FMF. The pain and fever can be reduced by taking PMC-LLaMA.  NSAIDs may also be used. People with FMF may also need treatment for depression or anxiety caused by the disease.","1.

The first attack generally occurs in childhood or the teens and is typically a febrile illness with abdominal pain, headache, and a rash. 3. Subsequent attacks are characterized by fever and pain in one or more serous cavities. 4. The attacks may be associated with scrotal pain and/or fever and pain in one or both ears, with or without ear discharge. 5. Between attacks, patients may be completely well, or may have mild continuing symptoms of serous cavity inflammation (e.g., abdominal pain or dyspepsia, or joint pain). 6. The frequency of attacks varies widely, from weekly to annually. Some have a relatively constant frequency of attacks (e.g., one attack every two weeks). 7. Attacks may last hours to days, with a shorter duration of attack in older patients. 8. In some patients, attacks are precipitated by physical exertion or sexual intercourse. 9. In patients who have a large number of attacks, amyloidosis may develop (less than 5% of patients). 10. In rare patients, a serious complication of amyloidosis may develop, including renal failure and intestinal obstruction. 11. In patients with a large accumulation of amyloid, a nephrotic syndrome may develop. 12. In women, amyloidosis may be associated with a lack of menstruation and/or dyspareunia. 13. In men, amyloidosis may be associated with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and/or testicular atrophy. 14. In children, attacks of fever and serositis may be associated with a lack of growth and delayed bone age. 15. In patients who have both amyloidosis and arthritis, the arthritis may be severe, with joint deformities. 16.

The condition is most commonly observed in individuals of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins.  The episodes of fever and serositis are typically accompanied by headaches, abdominal pain, and joint pain.  The condition is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin.  Researchers believe that pyrin is involved in regulating inflammation.  In FMF, the inflammatory response is not properly regulated, resulting in recurrent episodes of inflammation.  The episodes of inflammation cause the symptoms associated with FMF.  The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  This means that two copies of the MEFV gene must be altered for an individual to be affected.  People with one copy of an altered MEFV gene are carriers but do not have the condition themselves.  When both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy of having a child with FMF.  The MEFV gene is located on the X chromosome.  Males have one X chromosome and females have two X chromosomes.  Males with one copy of an altered MEFF gene are typically affected while females are typically carriers.  Affected individuals typically experience their first episode of fever and serositis before the age of 20.  The frequency and severity of the episodes may vary considerably between affected individuals.  Typically, the episodes last 12 to 72 hours and may occur as frequently as once every few days or as often as once every few years.  Between episodes, affected individuals typically have no symptoms.  The episodes of fever and serositis are typically accompanied by headaches, abdominal pain, and joint pain.  A small percentage of affected individuals experience a complication called amyloidosis, in which a protein called amyloid is deposited in various tissues and organs throughout the body.  Amyloidosis may affect the kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, or peripheral nerves.","Familial Mediterranean Fever is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain.

"1. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a rare disorder characterized by a burning sensation in the mouth, which can be very uncomfortable and distressing. The condition is not life-threatening, but can have a significant impact on quality of life. 2. The exact cause of burning mouth syndrome is not known. 3. There are several treatments that may help relieve symptoms, including topical anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and cognitive behavioral therapy. 4. In this study, we investigated the effect of topical application of a novel anticonvulsant, gabapentin, in the treatment of burning mouth syndrome. 5. Twelve patients with BMS diagnosis participated in this study. 6. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin in 6 patients with BMS diagnosis. Stage 2 evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin in another 6 patients with BMS diagnosis. 7. In both stages of the study, patients received gabapentin 100 mg three times a day for 15 days. Patients were instructed to apply the medication to the affected area of the oral mucosa three times a day. Patients were allowed to use other medications, including topical anesthetics. 8. In stage 1 of the study, 5 patients completed the 15-day treatment regimen. Two patients reported a significant reduction in symptoms, with one reporting complete resolution of symptoms. In stage 2 of the study, 5 patients completed the 15-day treatment regimen. Two patients reported a significant reduction in symptoms, with one reporting complete resolution of symptoms. 9. In both stages of the study, no side effects were reported. 10. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that gabapentin is a promising new treatment for BMS.",The discovery of the role of the microbiome in burning mouth syndrome is leading to new treatments. Several clinical trials are now underway to test the effectiveness of different approaches to modifying the microbiome in the mouth.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disorder characterized by burning symptoms in the absence of visible mucosal lesions. 2. The pathogenesis of BMS is not completely understood. 3. The most accepted hypothesis is the ""neuropathic pain"" theory, which postulates a disturbance in the central (sensory) and/or peripheral (trigeminal) nociceptive pathways. 4. The major limitation of this theory is that, to date, no abnormalities have been demonstrated in the nociceptive pathways of BMS patients. 5. In this context, we propose a new hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of BMS based on the ""disordered gustatory system"" theory. 6. In this scenario, BMS would result from an impairment in the gustatory system, which would lead to a ""sensory-motivational conflict,"" causing burning symptoms. 7. The main advantage of this new hypothesis is that it allows the integration of all the clinical and experimental data generated in the field of BMS over the past 20 years and provides a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder. 8. In addition, the identification of this new pathogenic mechanism opens new avenues for the treatment of BMS. 9. Recent findings suggest that the use of clonazepam and cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of BMS.","1. The burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a common condition characterized by burning pain in the mouth that is chronic, persistent, and often difficult to treat. 2. BMS is associated with a number of underlying conditions, including autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and gastrointestinal and psychiatric disorders. 3. BMS is often difficult to diagnose, and treatment is challenging because few interventions have proven efficacy. 4. The authors review the current understanding of BMS and its underlying mechanisms and propose a treatment algorithm. 5. The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.","I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with burning mouth syndrome for so long. It's important to know that not all cases of burning mouth syndrome have a known cause. However, in some cases, the condition may be related to an autoimmune disorder, a viral infection, or a side effect of medication. In other instances, the cause may be related to a problem with the hormones that control the salivary glands.

There's no single, proven treatment for burning mouth syndrome. However, some people find relief by using a combination of treatments, which may include:

1. Medications to relieve pain and dryness, including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical anesthetics

2. Dietary changes, such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and drinks, and using sugar-free products

3. Behavioral techniques, such as relaxation therapy and biofeedback

4. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing the way you think and behave about your condition

5. Rinses with specialized mouthwashes or normal saline solution

6. Vitamin and mineral supplements

7. Lidocaine mouth gel, which can be applied directly to the affected areas

8. Symptomatic treatment, such as artificial saliva and moisturizers

It's important to work closely with your health care provider to determine the best course of treatment for you. Some treatments may be expensive and may not be covered by insurance.

Over the past few years, researchers have made great strides in understanding the cause of burning mouth syndrome. Your participation in clinical trials may help lead to new and better treatments for this painful condition.

However, it may not be a good choice for someone who is not willing to take medications to prevent the gland from making too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid surgery - This is the most common treatment for large goiters.  It is usually recommended when medications do not control the symptoms or when the gland is so large that it causes problems with breathing or swallowing. Thyroid medications - These are pills that are taken every day to help control the symptoms caused by the goiter.  They do not shrink the gland, but they can lower thyroid hormone levels. External beam radiation therapy - This is a type of radiation that is given to the neck to shrink the thyroid gland.  It is not often used because it often does not work well and can take several years to shrink the gland.","1. You should get a Thyroid Profile done - TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and TG. 2.

"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, heart, lungs, kidneys and brain. It is a disease that can be very mild and not much of a problem (called ""benign lupus""), or very severe and life-threatening (called ""systemic lupus erythematosus"" or SLE). The cause of lupus is not known. Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system, which normally fights infection and disease, starts to attack the body's own cells and tissues. There is no cure for lupus, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it. Treatment depends on how severe it is and which parts of the body are affected. The goals of treatment are to:  Prevent flares  Treat flares when they occur  Reduce organ damage and other problems  Help you live well and have a good quality of life  Other treatments include:  Medicines that dampen the immune system  Sun protection  Exercise and healthy eating  Stress reduction  Getting enough sleep  Avoiding tobacco and too much caffeine  Talking with your doctor about treatments for depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems.  Hope this helps you. Wish you good health. Regards","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, blood vessels, and organs. It is an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body's immune system attacks the tissues and organs. Lupus has many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some common symptoms are painful or swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, feeling tired, and sensitivity to the sun.  Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. Getting diagnosed early is important because lupus can be treated, and treatment can help prevent damage to the joints, organs, and skin.   Anyone with lupus should receive proper medical care and followup. People with lupus often need to see different doctors. For example, a rheumatologist is a doctor who specializes in lupus and other diseases of the joints and muscles. Other doctors a person with lupus might see are a primary care doctor, an obstetrician/gynecologist (for issues related to pregnancy), a dermatologist (for skin problems), and a dentist.  Treatments for lupus include medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes, surgery. There are many kinds of medicines used to treat lupus, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, and corticosteroids. Some newer drugs for lupus include belimumab (Benlysta), eculizumab (Ravulizumab), and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). Lifestyle changes, such as exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep and rest, are also important.

Your loved one may be suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) which is causing the chest pain.2. The best way to prevent chest pain due to CAD is to take preventive measures before the occurrence of symptoms. Once the symptoms appear, the treatment becomes more difficult.3. You should consult a cardiologist and get your loved one evaluated for the presence of CAD.4. Depending on the severity of the disease, the cardiologist may recommend medicines, lifestyle changes, and/or a procedure called coronary angiography.5. In this procedure, a cardiologist injects a dye into your loved one's bloodstream and then uses a special X-ray machine to examine the heart arteries. This helps in finding out the blockages, their location, and their severity.6. Depending on the results of coronary angiography, the doctor may recommend a procedure called coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).7. In CABG, surgeons create new routes for the blood to flow to the heart by grafting new blood vessels onto the coronary arteries.8. CABG is a major surgery with a 50% survival rate.9. Some people may also need other procedures like coronary artery stenting or atherectomy.10. If the blockages are not severe, the doctor may recommend medicines and lifestyle changes.","1) If your loved one is not a good candidate for surgery, you can consider non-surgical treatments. 2) Non-surgical treatments include physical therapy, medications, injection therapies, and cognitive-behavioral therapies. 3) A physical therapist can help design a specific exercise program to improve your loved one's flexibility, strength, and endurance. 4) Medications can help relieve pain and reduce swelling. 5) Injection therapies, such as corticosteroids and platelet-rich plasma, can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. 6) Cognitive-behavioral therapies can help your loved one reduce fear, anxiety, and depression related to the condition.","1.

"1. The treatment of choice for melanoma is surgical excision. 2. Surgical excision of the primary lesion may be performed with either wide local excision or amputation depending upon the location and extent of the lesion. 3. Wide local excision is performed with a 1-2 cm margin of skin and a 1 cm margin of normal skin. 4. Amputation is performed when a primary lesion is very extensive or when the lesion involves underlying bone, nerve or major blood vessels. 5. Surgical excision of metastatic lesions may be performed if the lesions are operable and if the expected benefit outweighs the risks of the procedure. 6. For patients with inoperable metastatic disease, palliative radiation therapy may be considered to treat symptomatic lesions. 7. In general, radiation therapy has been used for palliation of painful bony metastases, brain metastases, or respiratory obstruction due to mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 8. Radiation therapy has also been used in the treatment of symptomatic skin and soft tissue metastases, but with inconsistent results. 9. The role of radiation therapy for melanoma is still under investigation.","1. Radiation therapy is not a standard treatment for melanoma. However, in some cases, radiation may be used to treat melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes. Radiation may also be used to treat unresectable primary melanoma or metastatic melanoma when surgery is not an option. 2. Radiation therapy works better for treating melanoma in some locations than in others. For example, it is more effective in treating melanoma on the scalp than on the legs. 3. The use of radiation therapy may affect the way a drug or other therapy works. For example, some drugs may interfere with the ability of radiation to work. Other drugs may enhance the effects of radiation therapy.","5-year overall survival for melanoma of the skin in the leg or foot is 43%.

Regular hearing exam","1. Friedreich ataxia is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the nerves. It primarily affects the sensory, autonomic, and motor nerves in the arms and legs. 2. Symptoms of Friedreich ataxia usually appear in childhood and include difficulty walking, frequent falls, muscle weakness, toe-walking, and speech problems. 3. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may develop, including impaired vision, hearing loss, heart problems, and swallowing difficulties. 4. Friedreich ataxia is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene, which provides the instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Researchers are not sure how frataxin helps the body work normally, but they think that the protein may be involved in iron transport and regulation of gene expression. 5. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that two copies of the FXN gene must be altered for a person to be affected. 6. People with Friedreich ataxia inherit one copy of the altered gene from one affected parent. These individuals are called carriers. They do not have symptoms of Friedreich ataxia but can pass the altered gene on to their children. 7. To inherit Friedreich ataxia, a person must inherit one copy of the altered FXN gene from each parent. People with one copy of the altered FXN gene do not have symptoms of Friedreich ataxia. 8. Diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia is based on the symptoms and a family history of the disorder. DNA testing can confirm the diagnosis. 9. There is currently no cure for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the relief of symptoms. Physical therapy may help with muscle weakness and coordination problems. Orthopedic appliances may be used to correct foot deformities and improve balance and walking. Corrective shoes may be used to improve gait and prevent falls. 10. Friedreich ataxia does not shorten your life span. People with this disorder typically live into adulthood.","1. What is Friedreich's ataxia? Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes movement problems. People with this condition have problems with balance and coordination. They may have shaking hands and trouble walking. Speech may also become slurred. People with this condition usually develop symptoms before age 25. 2. What causes Friedreich's ataxia? Friedreich's ataxia is caused by a gene mutation. The gene is on chromosome 9. The condition is passed from parents to their children. People who have the gene mutation develop the disease. The symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia get worse over time. 3. What are the treatments for Friedreich's ataxia? There is no cure for Friedreich's ataxia. Treatments aim to help relieve symptoms. People with this condition need to see many different doctors. They should see a neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, and physical therapist. 4. What research is being done on Friedreich's ataxia? Many research studies with people are under way. These studies are testing new ways to treat Friedreich's ataxia. Some studies are testing new drugs. Other studies are testing new surgical procedures.","1. What is Friedreich ataxia? Friedreich ataxia is a rare inherited condition that affects the nervous system and causes progressive damage to the nerves. The nerves are the link between the brain and the rest of the body. They carry information to and from the brain. In Friedreich ataxia, the nerves in the arms and legs slowly deteriorate. This causes muscle weakness, loss of coordination (ataxia), and other problems. The heart and other organs may also be affected. 2. What causes Friedreich ataxia? Friedreich ataxia is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 9. The gene carries instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Researchers think that frataxin is important for normal development of the nervous system. People with Friedreich ataxia make abnormal frataxin or very little frataxin, which leads to progressive damage to the nerves. 3. How is Friedreich ataxia inherited? Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that two copies of the gene in each cell must be altered for a person to be affected. Most often, people with Friedreich ataxia inherit one copy of the altered gene from a parent and one copy from a grandparent. 4. Who is at risk for Friedreich ataxia? The condition occurs in about 1 in 50,000 people. It affects both boys and girls. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia, but some medications and therapies can help relieve symptoms. 5. What are the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia? Symptoms usually appear in childhood or adolescence. They include: - Muscle weakness in the arms and legs - Loss of coordination (ataxia) - Problems with speech and swallowing - Heart problems, including a fast or irregular heartbeat, enlarged heart, or weakness of the heart muscle. 6. How is Friedreich ataxia diagnosed? A doctor may suspect Friedreich ataxia based on a physical exam and a patient's medical history. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. To do this, a blood sample is taken and sent to a laboratory to check for the presence","1. The symptoms of Friedreich ataxia usually begin in childhood or adolescence and progress slowly over time. 2. Most people with Friedreich ataxia use a wheelchair at some point after the onset of walking. 3. People with Friedreich ataxia have a reduced life expectancy; the average age at death is in the mid-forties for men and early fifties for women. 4. Friedreich ataxia is caused by an alteration (mutation) in one of the genes in each cell of the body. 5. Most people with Friedreich ataxia inherit the altered gene from a parent. 6. If both parents have Friedreich ataxia, there is a 25% chance that their child will develop the condition. 7. In people with Friedreich ataxia, the altered gene cannot make the protein it normally makes, and a decreased amount of the protein is produced. 8. The protein, called frataxin, is needed to keep certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord healthy. 9. Without enough frataxin, these nerve cells slowly deteriorate over time. 10. The loss of these nerve cells leads to impaired movement and speech, as well as other symptoms. 11. Scientists think that frataxin may also be needed to keep other types of cells, such as those in the heart and skeletal muscles, healthy. 12. The severity of Friedreich ataxia varies from person to person. 13. Some people with Friedreich ataxia have only mild impairment, while others are severely affected. 14. The symptoms of Friedreich ataxia include the following: Impaired movement. Muscle weakness usually begins in the feet and hands, and progresses over time. It affects the arms more than the legs. Legs may turn inward while walking (gait abnormalities). Difficulty with speech (dysarthria). Loss of sensation (neuropathy). Impaired eye movements, particularly when trying to look up (gaze-evoked nystagmus). Numbness in the feet and hands. Heart problems. The heart is affected in most people with Friedreich ataxia.

Liquid or food products containing citrate like lemon juice, orange juice, apple juice, grapefruit juice, pineapple juice, tomato juice etc. can also be used. 3. Pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can also be used to relieve pain. 4. Other medical therapies include: a. Alpha blockers like Tamsulosin (Flomax) which relaxes the muscles in the bladder neck and prostate, thereby improves urine flow and also reduces the pain. b. Phosphate binders which are used to prevent the absorption of phosphate in the intestines. This helps to reduce the amount of calcium phosphate in the kidneys and decrease the chances of developing more stones. c. Calcium channel blockers like nifedipine can also be used to reduce the spasm of the smooth muscles in the kidney which can help the stone to pass more easily. 5. Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is the most common and effective treatment for kidney stones. In this procedure, shock waves are used to break the stones into small pieces so that the pieces can be passed in the urine. This procedure is done by placing a device on the patient's back which generates these shock waves. The patient may require sedation for this procedure. 6. Ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy is another effective treatment for kidney stones. In this procedure, a very small scope is passed through the urethra and bladder into the ureter and then into the kidney. Through the laser, the stones are broken into small pieces which are then passed in the urine. This procedure is also done under sedation. 7.

It is good to know the family history of all cancers in maternal side.","Genetic testing for lung cancer is in its infancy.  Researchers are just beginning to discover the genetic mutations that can cause lung cancer.  Currently, there are no specific genetic tests for lung cancer.  However, researchers are working to identify the genetic mutations that cause familial lung cancer.  In the meantime, your family may want to consider getting regular lung cancer screenings.","It is possible that there is a genetic component to the lung cancer that has affected your mother-in-law and her family.  It would be worthwhile to discuss with a genetic counselor the possibility of testing your husband and his sisters.  The genetic counselor can discuss the implications of the testing, and whether or not it is appropriate for your husband and his family.  It is possible that there is a pattern in your husband's family that would indicate a genetic susceptibility to lung cancer.  However, it is important to remember that just because there is a genetic susceptibility, it does not mean that your husband is doomed to get lung cancer.  It just means that he may have an increased risk over the general population.","The family history you describe is concerning for a hereditary lung cancer syndrome.  Testing your mother-in-law and comparing her results with those of your husband and his sisters could help identify if the cancer is hereditary.  There are several genetic tests available for known hereditary lung cancer syndromes, including testing for mutations in the EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF genes.  Testing may also be available for other known lung cancer genes.  A genetic counselor can help you and your family understand the benefits and limitations of genetic testing.","Your husband and his sisters should be tested for lung cancer susceptibility genes if their mother was diagnosed with lung cancer before age 50 or if three or more first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, child) had lung cancer, including lung cancer that was caused by radon or by a substance such as asbestos or arsenic.  Testing your husband and his sisters may help to determine whether they have an inherited susceptibility to lung cancer.  If they do, they can be monitored more closely for signs of lung cancer and possibly can be treated early, when the disease is at an early, curable stage.  Testing also may help to determine whether your children and other close relatives are at risk for lung cancer.","1.

"1. Hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome are not directly related. 2. However, if you have Tourette syndrome, you are at risk for developing hydrocephalus. 3. The reason is that the same condition of the central nervous system that causes the tics of Tourette syndrome may also cause the blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system, resulting in hydrocephalus. 4. In your case, it is possible that the implantation of the shunt relieved the symptoms of hydrocephalus. 5. There is no evidence that tics cause hydrocephalus.","1. Tourette syndrome usually begins during childhood, around the age of 7 years. 2. You underwent a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt at the age of 72 for hydrocephalus. There is no direct connection between Tourette syndrome and hydrocephalus. However, both conditions can be caused by genetic mutations on chromosome 18. 3. Tics can cause movements of the neck and head which may lead to shunt malfunction. It is important to have regular check-ups with your neurosurgeon to ensure that your shunt is working properly.","1. Tourette's and Hydrocephalus: Hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. It can be caused by a number of factors, including a blockage in the normal flow of CSF, or by an overproduction of CSF. Hydrocephalus can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, nausea and vomiting, difficulty walking, and mental confusion. Hydrocephalus is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention. 2. Tourette's and Hydrocephalus: In your case, you have been diagnosed with both Tourette's and Hydrocephalus. The exact cause of either of these conditions is not known. There are various theories about the cause of both these conditions. One such theory is that both these conditions are caused by an abnormality in the same area of the brain. This area of the brain is called the Basal Ganglia. This is an area deep within the brain that controls movement and coordination. 3. Tourette's and Hydrocephalus: If you have both Tourette's and Hydrocephalus, you should consult a Neurologist who will be able to examine you and make the correct diagnosis. He may also ask you to undergo a few tests to confirm the diagnosis.","1. Yes, Tourette's can cause Hydrocephalus. 2. It is very rare for an individual to get both. 3.

Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain is not able to flow properly. 3. The CSF flows through the ventricles (small spaces in the brain) and then outside the brain and spinal cord into the subarachnoid space. 4. When the CSF does not flow properly, the amount of fluid increases in the ventricles and puts pressure on the surrounding brain tissue. 5. This can lead to symptoms such as headaches, problems with balance or walking, and changes in vision. 6. Hydrocephalus can be caused by a blockage in the CSF flow or by the body producing too much CSF. 7. Blockages can be caused by a tumor, injury, or infection. 8.

Some of the new drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Afatinib (Broadcast), and Ceritinib (Zykadia). These drugs are designed to target specific genetic mutations in lung cancer cells.  Another new treatment for lung cancer is a type of immunotherapy called nivolumab (Opdivo). This drug works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which can prevent the immune system from attacking cancer cells.  Another new lung cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy called necitumumab (Portugal). This drug also works by blocking a protein called EGFR, which can prevent the growth of lung cancer cells.  In addition, there are new combinations of drugs that have been approved for lung cancer, including pemetrexed plus Aluminum (Almita) and pemetrexed plus carboplatin (Alcapa).",1. The latest advancements in treating lung cancer is the use of targeted therapies. These therapies are used in patients who do not have any of the targeted mutations.

Over the past few years, there has been an emphasis on tailoring treatment to the specific type of lung cancer that a patient has. For example, patients with a specific type of adenocarcinoma (a type of lung cancer) may benefit from treatment with a targeted therapy, such as erlotinib (Tarceva). Another targeted therapy, sunitinib (Sutent), which was originally approved to treat kidney cancer, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a type of lung cancer known as a squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, a new type of targeted therapy, the so-called anti-angiogenic agent, has shown promise in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. In the area of chemotherapy, the development of newer agents, such as pemetrexed (Alimta), has led to improved response rates and better tolerability.

"1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a well-established treatment for decompression sickness and air embolism.2. Anecdotal reports of the use of HBO for the treatment of Meniere's disease date back to the 1960s, but no controlled trials of its use in this condition have been reported.3. The rationale for the use of HBO in Meniere's disease is based on its effects on the inner ear. In the presence of raised intracranial pressure, HBO can induce the production of a retrolabyrinthine pressure gradient by increasing the pressure in the middle ear and the external auditory canal, thereby potentially reducing symptoms by decreasing the pressure differential between the inner ear and the external auditory canal.4. The results of the present study suggest that HBO has no role in the treatment of patients with Meniere's disease.","1. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is a form of treatment in which a patient breathes 100 percent oxygen at a pressure two to three times greater than normal atmospheric pressure. 2. The increased pressure allows more oxygen to be dissolved in the blood and more oxygen is delivered to the tissues of the body. 3. The increased oxygen is believed to help heal damaged or injured tissues. 4. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is currently considered a primary treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning, osteoradionecrosis, decompression sickness, and radiation tissue damage. 5. It is also considered an adjunctive therapy for burns, non-healing wounds, skin grafts and flaps, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, and compament syndrome. 6. Off label uses include treatment of conditions such as refractory osteomyelitis, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, tinnitus, and hearing loss. 7. Hyperbaric oxygen is currently considered an experimental therapy for the treatment of Meniere's disease.","1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in the treatment of idiopathic Meniere's disease. 2. A total of 30 patients (15 in the HBO group and 15 in the control group) were enrolled in the study. 3. Patients were evaluated with the 1) Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire for quality of life, 2) dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), and 3) Beck's Depression Inventory. 4. All patients were evaluated before treatment and at the end of the third month. 5. In the HBO group, 11 of 15 patients reported improvement, 3 were unchanged, and 1 worsened. In the control group, 8 of 15 patients reported improvement, 6 were unchanged, and 1 worsened. 6. Quality of life and handicap scores improved in both groups. 7. In the HBO group, the improvement in the SF-36 scores were 37.7% and 20.7% in the control group (p=0.04). 8. In the HBO group, the improvement in the DHI scores were 42.7% and 10% in the control group (p=0.001). 9. In the HBO group, the improvement in the Beck scores were 26.7% and 13.3% in the control group (p=0.04). 10. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective adjuvant therapy in the treatment of idiopathic Meniere's disease.","1. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance to a varying degree. 2. Treatment for Meniere's disease is not always necessary unless symptoms are severe. 3. When treatment is needed, medication or surgery may be considered. 4. Some people may also find relief with alternative treatments such as acupuncture or herbal therapies. 5. In rare cases, people may experience a sudden and severe loss of hearing or balance. If this occurs, it is important to seek immediate medical attention.","1. Yes, I do. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance to a varying degree. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment has been used with some success in treating this condition. 2. The goal of hyperbaric oxygen treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen in the body's tissues. This increased oxygen flow is thought to help heal damaged inner ear tissues. 3. People who receive hyperbaric oxygen for Meniere's disease typically receive treatment in a hyperbaric chamber. This is a large metal container that is pressurized to greater than normal atmospheric pressure. The increased pressure causes oxygen to be forced into the tissues of the body. 4. The number of treatments required varies, but most people undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatments for several weeks. 5. While hyperbaric oxygen treatments can be very helpful, they are not always effective. Some people continue to have episodes of vertigo or hearing loss even after receiving treatments.","1. Meniere's disease is an idiopathic disorder of the inner ear that is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and sensation of fullness in the involved ear. 2. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism of Meniere disease is not known. 3. Current accepted treatments are used to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and include bed rest, vestibular suppressants such as dimenhydrinate, diuretics, and salt restriction. 4. Surgical procedures such as labyrinthectomy, vestibular nerve section, and endolymphatic shunt have been used with some success in patients not responding to medical treatment. 5. In 1960, Charles Chamberlain reported the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of 12 patients with Meniere disease. 6. Since that time, a number of authors have reported the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of this disease. 7. To date, there have been no randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies evaluating the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of Meniere disease. 8. The exact mechanism of action of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of this disease is unknown. 9. Theoretic mechanisms of action include a reduction in the activity of the vestibular system secondary to the delivery of a greater than atmospheric pressure of oxygen to the inner ear, a reduction in the formation of endolymph secondary to the effects of pressure on the ionic composition of the endolymph, and a reduction in the formation of edema secondary to the effects of pressure on the ionic composition of the endolymph. 10. At this time, the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of Meniere disease cannot be recommended based on the results of current published literature."
"1. Cochlear implantation is a surgical procedure in which the electrode array is placed in the inner ear (cochlea) through the ear canal. It is a safe surgical procedure with a high success rate. 2. The cochlear implant electrode array stimulates the auditory nerve fibers directly. As a result, the brain is able to process sound signals and convert them into meaningful language. 3. The implant does not restore normal hearing, but it has been shown to provide significant improvements in understanding speech. 4. The implant is usually recommended for individuals who have severe to profound hearing loss, and who have failed to respond to hearing aids. 5. Cochlear implants are typically used for people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing from birth or caused by meningitis, otosclerosis, ototoxicity, or other causes of acquired deafness. 6. The cochlear implant is not for people with deafness caused by auditory nerve disorders or damage, or for people with single-sided deafness.","1. Yes, if your child is 12 months or older, has bilateral severe hearing loss and has not shown any progress with hearing aids.2.

The main indication for cochlear implant is severe to profound bilateral SNHL which is not benefited by hearing aids. 2. Cochlear implants are not useful in conductive deafness. 3. Cochlear implants are helpful in patients with retrocochlear/ neural deafness. 4. Cochlear implants bypass the non-functional 8th nerve and directly stimulate the auditory brainstem and cochlear nuclei. 5. Cochlear implants are helpful in patients with severe to profound hearing loss. 6. Cochlear implants are not useful if the auditory brainstem cannot process the electrical signals. 7. Cochlear implants are not useful if the VIII nerve is not present. 8. Cochlear implants are not useful if the cochlea is non-functional.,1. Cochlear implants are not recommended for children who are deaf but have some residual hearing.2. The child should be able to sit still and follow simple instructions.3. The child should be able to learn speech and language with the help of hearing aids.4. The child should be able to learn sign language.5. The child should have no medical problems.6. The parents should be willing to spend time working with the child to develop language skills.7. The family should have access to a computer with Internet service so that the child can practice speech and language skills.,"1. The cochlear implant is a small electronic device that is surgically implanted under the skin behind the ear. It receives sound from a microphone worn on the ear, and the sound signals are sent to the implant. 2. The implant is designed to bypass damaged ear structures and directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical impulses. 3. Cochlear implants are approved by the FDA only for adults and children older than 12 years. 4. The child must be healthy enough to withstand the surgery and be able to work with a speech therapist after the implant is activated. 5. The child's cognitive ability must be at a level to be able to learn how to use the implant and make sense of the sounds heard. 6. The child should be evaluated by a team of professionals before getting a cochlear implant. This team will include an audiologist, a speech language pathologist, and an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Other professionals, such as a psychologist or a special educator, may also be needed.",1) Cochlear implants are a good option for children with severe to profound SNHL who do not respond to hearing aids. 2) The child should be fit with hearing aids as soon as possible to take advantage of auditory stimulation and oral language development. 3) Cochlear implants should be considered if hearing aids do not provide sufficient auditory stimulation or if speech and language skills are not developing adequately.
"1. Strabismus (also known as ""crossed eye"" or ""squint"") is a condition in which the eyes are misaligned. 2. In the normal eye, the muscles that move the eye are controlled by the brain. 3. The brain sends a signal to the eye muscles telling them when and how far to move the eye. 4. When both eyes are not moving together, the brain sends a ""mixed up"" signal to the muscles. 5. This causes one eye to move and the other to stay still, or vice versa. 6. The cause of strabismus may be apparent, such as a physical defect in the eye, or it may be due to poor vision in one eye. 7. In some cases, the cause is not known. 8. Strabismus is common in children, and often develops in the first year of life. 9. It may also occur in adults, and can develop at any age. 10. Strabismus in children is usually corrected with glasses and/or vision therapy. 11. Surgery is used to correct strabismus in adults and children who do not see well, or who have strabismus that does not improve with glasses and vision therapy. 12. Surgery moves the eye muscles so that the eyes are aligned. 13. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, and usually takes about two to three hours. 14. It is done on an outpatient basis, and usually requires one or two days of rest before the patient can resume normal activities. 15. Although the risk of complications is low, there are risks associated with any surgery. 16. These include infection, bleeding and anesthesia-related risks. 17. In addition, moving an eye muscle changes the way the eye works. 18. It is important to discuss these potential complications with your surgeon before surgery.","1. Strabismus, also known as amblyopia or squint, is a condition where the eyes are misaligned or skew-whiff. This can result in double vision or, if one eye is permanently out of alignment, reduced vision in one eye (or both). 2. Treatment options include wearing glasses with prism lenses to correct the vision problems caused by the eyes being misaligned. Another option is patching one eye to force the other eye to see more clearly. The most common surgical procedure is called'strabismus surgery'. In this operation, the muscles that control the eye movements are adjusted to realign the eyes. 3. Recent advances in strabismus surgery include the use of improved technology such as the use of the laser to perform the surgery. Another recent advance is the use of botulinum toxin type A to treat strabismus. Botulinum toxin is a medication that is injected into the muscles that control eye movements. This treatment is most often used for people whose strabismus is caused by a muscle that has a tight muscle. 4. Researchers are also investigating new surgical techniques, such as the use of scaffolds that can be implanted into the eye muscles to help the muscles work better. 5. Stem cell research may also hold promise for the treatment of strabismus. Researchers are investigating ways to use stem cells to grow new eye muscles and improve eye alignment.","50% of children born with lazy eye (amblyopia) do not respond to traditional patching therapy. Lazy eye surgery can be an option for those who do not respond to patching therapy. Lazy eye surgery involves closing the eye with better vision. This forces the brain to use the eye with poorer vision. The goal of lazy eye surgery is to improve the vision in the lazy eye. Lazy eye surgery should be performed before the age of 5. The earlier the surgery, the better the outcome. Lazy eye surgery does not always produce perfect vision.","1. The brain can be re-trained to see properly even after surgery for strabismus (crossed eyes) corrective eye surgery. 2. The brain can be re-trained to see even after the eye muscles are weakened or paralyzed. 3. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for cataracts, glaucoma, and other eye conditions. 4. The brain can be re-trained to see properly even after eye surgery for lazy eye (amblyopia). 5. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for double vision (diplopia). 6. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). 7. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for retinal detachment. 8. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for retinitis pigmentosa. 9. The brain can be re-trained to see properly after eye surgery for macular degeneration. 10. The brain can be re-trained to see properly even after eye surgery for corneal transplant.","1. AMD is a degenerative eye disease that damages the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. It causes problems with activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. 2. Stem cells are cells found in the eye that normally replenish the cells that are lost as a person ages. Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can become specialized cells. AMD damages the macula, which is made up of specialized cells. Researchers think that if the damaged macula could be rebuilt using healthy cells from the eye's stem cells, vision could be restored. 3. There are several ways to inject stem cells into the eye. One method is to inject stem cells between the layers of the retina. Another method is to inject stem cells into the eye's jelly-like fluid called the vitreous. 4. The most common side effects of the procedure are inflammation and swelling of the eye. Other side effects include cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. 5. Some patients may also have headaches, nausea, and vomiting after the procedure. 6. Scientists are also studying ways to inject stem cells into the eye using a small laser beam.","1. Amblyopia is a condition that occurs when the brain ors one eye over the other. The brain is the organ that controls which eye to look at. When the brain is not working properly, it may cause one eye to be favored over the other. This condition is called amblyopia. 2. The treatment for amblyopia is to force the brain to work harder by closing one eye. This is called occlusion therapy. Occlusion therapy is the most common and effective treatment for amblyopia. 3. Occlusion therapy is usually started when the child is very young. 4. The patch over the good eye is usually worn for several weeks. Once the patch is removed, the brain will work harder to see images from the eye under the patch. 5. This process is repeated until the vision in the affected eye improves."

Some people call SIDS ""crib death"" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs. 2) You can get information about SIDS from your local health department or from organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). 3) The AAP and NICHD offer these suggestions to help reduce the risk of SIDS: - Place your baby on his or her back to sleep, even for short naps. - Use a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet 4) For more information, call the NICHD Information Clearinghouse at 1-800-370-2943 or go on the Internet to http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/sids.cfm.","1. Sudden infant death syn PMC-LLaMA.  It is defined as the sudden death of an infant that is unexpected by history and unexplained by a thorough postmortem examination. 2. The most common hypothesis for SIDS is prolonged apnea. Prolonged apnea is a condition in which an infant stops breathing for a prolonged period. This may occur for up to 10 seconds with a normal infant. However, an infant with SIDS will not start breathing again (resume normal breathing) within that 10 second time period. 3. There are several risk factors for SIDS. These include: a. Younger age b. Premature birth c. Male sex d. Low birth weight e. Sleeping on the stomach f. Soft sleeping surface g. Higher number of siblings h. Maternal and/or paternal smoking History of SIDS in a family member 4. There are several ways to reduce the risk of SIDS. These include: a. Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. The ""tummy time"" when babies are awake and someone is watching is fine, but for sleep, the back is best. b. Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet. Soft surfaces, such as fluffy or plush bedding, increase the chance of suffocation. c. Making sure babies don't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult. d. Don't smoke during pregnancy or allow anyone to smoke near your baby"

Treatment options for AML depend on a number of factors, including the subtype of AML, the age and general health of the patient, and whether the disease has come back after initial treatment. 2. The most common treatment for AML is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is usually given in 3-week cycles. Each cycle involves one or more anticancer drugs, which are infused into a vein in the hospital or clinic. 3. Other drugs, called leukemia growth factors, may also be used to encourage the growth of healthy blood cells. 4. In some cases, radiation therapy may be used alone or in addition to chemotherapy or leukemia growth factors. 5. A newer type of therapy for AML is called monoclonal antibody therapy. This type of treatment uses antibodies to target cancer cells and kill them. 6. Stem cell transplantation is another type of therapy for AML. It is a procedure in which the patient is given high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The goal of this treatment is to kill the cancer cells and destroy the patient's diseased bone marrow. High doses of chemotherapy and radiation cause problems such as severe vomiting and a weakened immune system. 7. To prevent these side effects, the patient is given new stem cells, which are immature cells that will make healthy blood cells. The stem cells are given by infusing them into a vein or by injecting them directly into bone marrow.","1. The most common treatment for this problem is the use of a nasal dilator.

"Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that affects the small intestine and other parts of the body. It is most common in middle-aged white men. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and joint pain. It can be fatal if not treated. The disease is often first noticed when a person has vague symptoms that don't seem to be related to each other.  Whipple disease is caused by infection with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. The bacteria invade the small intestine and other organs. This causes swelling (inflammation) and prevents the intestines from absorbing nutrients.  The main symptom of Whipple disease is diarrhea. Other symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, joint pain, and loss of appetite.  People with Whipple disease often have a variety of other symptoms. Some of these symptoms are skin rashes, including a red or purple rash on the lower legs. People with this disease may also have vision problems, including vision loss.  In rare cases, Whipple disease can cause more serious problems, such as heart valve disease, brain swelling, and nerve damage.  A rare complication of Whipple disease is cancer. People with this disease are at high risk of developing a tumor in the small intestine (intestinal lymphoma).  The doctor will use a physical exam, blood tests, and specialized tests to diagnose Whipple disease. These tests include a biopsy of the small intestine, a blood test to detect antibodies to the bacteria, and a specialized eye exam.  Whipple disease is treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics need to be taken for a long time, possibly for the rest of the person's life. People with this disease often need to take vitamin supplements.

"1. Yes, you can use IVF to prevent passing on the disease to your child. 2. IVF is a complex procedure. You will have to undergo hormonal evaluation and follicular monitoring to know when your eggs are mature. Your husbands' sperm will be collected on the day of egg collection. The eggs and sperm will be taken to the laboratory where they will be combined and allowed to grow for a few days. Once the embryos are formed, they will be frozen. When the embryos are frozen, they will be transferred to an IVF center where they will be thawed and placed in your uterus. 3. You will be given medications to support the pregnancy. 4. The procedure takes time. It may take up to a year to complete. 5. The success rate of IVF is about 40%. 6. Pheochromocytoma is a serious disease. You should discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with your doctor.","1. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors that occur in a group of diseases called ""The 10"". 2. The 10 refers to the 10 associated tumors or symptoms that often accompany pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. These include: headaches, high blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, tremors, weight loss, heart problems and gut problems.3. The tumors can be life-threatening if not treated.4. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are caused by changes in certain genes.5. Genetic testing can detect the disease in family members.6. If you are a family member of someone with one of these diseases, you can get genetic testing to see if you have the disease.7. If you are found to have the disease, you should receive lifelong care from a specialist.8. If you are not at risk for the disease, you can talk with your doctor about other preventive measures.9. If you are at risk for the disease, you can talk with a genetic counselor and/or a doctor experienced in treating this disease.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization can reduce the risk of passing on pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma to your kids. 2. This is because in vitro fertilization allows for genetic screening of embryos. 3. This means that any embryos with pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma will be identified and not implanted into your uterus.","1. Yes, IVF could help you in avoiding passing on the condition to your offspring. 2. Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma is a genetic condition, which means it is caused by a problem with a gene. 3. A person with this condition has a gene that does not work properly. This gene tells cells how to perform certain functions. 4. When the gene does not work properly, it causes cells to grow out of control. This out of control growth results in tumor formation. 5. In IVF, the egg and sperm are combined in the laboratory to form an embryo. 6. The embryo is placed in the uterus of a woman who is acting as a surrogate for the biological mother. 7. This woman has been selected by the biological mother because she meets specific criteria. 8. The surrogate has no genetic connection to the baby. 9. The biological mother is able to produce an egg through ovulation induction, which is then removed for IVF. 10. The egg is combined with sperm in the laboratory to form an embryo. 11. The embryo is placed in the uterus of the biological mother. 12. Because the biological mother is not genetically linked to the baby, she is not passing on the condition to her child. 13. The biological father, however, is still genetically linked to the child and could pass on the condition. 14. To prevent this from happening, the biological father could undergo genetic testing to determine if he carries the gene for the condition. 15. If he does not carry the gene, he could still use IVF with ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) to have a child. 16. If he does carry the gene, he could still use IVF with donor sperm.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization is a good option to prevent the condition from being passed on. 2. Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma is a genetic condition. 3. It is caused by a mutation in one of several genes that are involved in the formation of a particular protein. 4. The protein is involved in the regulation of the balance of certain substances in our bodies that are responsible for controlling our blood pressure. 5. When the gene is mutated, the protein does not work properly, and the balance of these substances is lost. 6. This causes the symptoms of pheochromocytoma paraganglioma. 7. The condition is passed on in families. 8. If your girlfriend is a carrier of the mutation, there is a 50% chance that any child she has will inherit the condition. 9. If she is not a carrier, none of the children will inherit the condition. 10. In vitro fertilization can prevent the condition from being passed on because the embryo can be tested for the presence of the mutation using a technique called preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 11. Only embryos that do not have the mutation would be implanted into the uterus.","1. Yes, IVF can minimize the risk of passing on Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma to your child. 2. IVF involves harvesting eggs from your girlfriend's ovaries, fertilizing them in the lab with your sperm, and then placing the fertilized egg into the uterus of the woman. 3. By doing so, only healthy egg and sperm are used to create a baby, and the unhealthy gene is not passed on to the child. 4. In this case, since your girlfriend is a carrier of Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma, she would need to undergo IVF to minimize the risk of passing on the condition to her child. 5. It is important to note that IVF is not a foolproof method of preventing genetic disorders, since IVF can introduce new genetic mutations. 6. Therefore, it is always recommended to consult with a genetic counselor to fully understand the risks involved."

In most cases of Friedreich ataxia, the gene that makes this protein is missing one of its two copies (is mutated). 2. Scientists do not know why the frataxin protein is so important, but they think it might be involved in regulating the activity of certain chemicals in the body that are important for nerve function. 3. In some cases, the frataxin protein is present but does not function normally, even though the gene is not missing any chemical building blocks (amino acids). 4. Researchers think that a shortage of frataxin protein may cause the nerve damage seen in people with Friedreich ataxia. 5. In the United States, Friedreich ataxia affects about 1 in 50,000 people. 6. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich ataxia. 7. Friedreich ataxia is managed with supportive care. 8.

"1. Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. 2. Type 1 diabetes is usually first noticed when a child is diagnosed with a ""sugar"" or ""diabetes"" as the disease is often referred to. 3. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. 4. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in people under the age of 30. 5. Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed when a person's body does not produce enough insulin. 6. Insulin is a chemical produced by the pancreas. This chemical is needed to help glucose get into the cells of the body. Glucose is the fuel the body needs to stay healthy. 7. Insulin also helps fat and muscle cells use the glucose for energy. 8. If a person has too little insulin, the glucose stays in the blood instead of going into the cells. 9. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with the heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. 10. The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known. However, scientists believe that type 1 diabetes is the result of a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. 11. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults. It is less common in people over age 40. 12. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed before age 30. However, about 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed after age 30. 13. Type 1 diabetes develops in people who do not produce any insulin. 14. Insulin is produced in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ behind the stomach. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps glucose get into the cells of the body. 15. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. As a result, the body produces little or no insulin","The causes of type 1 diabetes are not yet fully understood. Research suggests that type 1 diabetes results from an interaction of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors that result in the destruction of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.","3 main factors are: 1) genetic factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) autoimmunity.","The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known.

"1. Lung diseases: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. Smoking also causes lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. 2. Heart diseases: Smoking raises blood pressure, contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, and causes damage to the heart and blood vessels. It is a major risk factor for heart disease. 3. Cancers: Smoking causes many cancers, including cancer of the lung, bladder, kidney, and cervix. It also increases the risk of cancer of the throat, stomach, liver, and pancreas. 4. Reproductive problems: Smoking can cause a low sperm count and may affect fertility and ability to conceive. It also increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. 5. Other: Smoking increases the risk of cataracts, blindness from eye diseases, osteoporosis, and skin aging. It also increases the risk of erectile dysfunction (impotence).",1.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer caused by smoking, but smoking also causes cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, tongue, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, and bladder. It also causes some other cancers, including cancer of the womb and cervix (the lower part of the uterus). 2. Heart disease: Smoking raises blood pressure and causes the arteries to narrow. This makes it more likely that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke. Smoking also damages the heart muscle and makes it unable to pump as well as it should. 3. Lung disease: Smoking damages the lungs in many ways. It can cause the air sacs to collapse, making it hard to breathe.

"Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Seeing an Eye M.D. can help you determine what type of glaucoma you have and what treatment options are available.  NIH: National Eye Institute","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are primary and secondary glaucoma. 2. Primary glaucoma usually occurs without any other eye disease. It is caused by an increase in pressure in the eye. This increase occurs because the fluid in the eye is being made too rapidly or is not being drained from the eye properly. 3. Secondary glaucoma is caused by an eye injury or other eye conditions. Examples of eye conditions that may cause secondary glaucoma include: - Cataracts - Inflammation of the eye - Tumors of the eye - Eye tumors - Diabetic eye diseases 4. Risk Factors for Glaucoma: - Age - People over 60 years of age are at higher risk for developing glaucoma. - Race - African Americans have a higher risk for glaucoma than other races. - Family history - People with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk for developing glaucoma. - Glaucoma - People with glaucoma in one eye are at higher risk for glaucoma in the other eye. - High eye pressure - Long-term high eye pressure can increase the risk for glaucoma. - Diabetes - People with diabetes are at higher risk for glaucoma. - Hypertension - People with high blood pressure are at higher risk for glaucoma. - Sleep apnea - People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for glaucoma. - Chronic eye diseases - People with chronic eye diseases, such as chronic angle-closure glaucoma or ocular hypertension, are at higher risk for glaucoma. 5. Preventing Glaucoma: - Control your blood pressure and diabetes, if you have either of these conditions. - Get regular eye exams. - Eat a healthy diet. - Get treatment for eye injuries. - Wear protective eyewear.","1.

If not treated, it can cause irreversible vision loss. 3. Some people have risk factors for open-angle glaucoma, such as being age 60 or older, having a family history of the disease, or being African American. 4. With closed-angle glaucoma, the fluid pressure inside the eye rises, causing the angle between the iris and cornea to close. This can lead to vision loss. 5. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. It can come on quickly and cause severe eye pain, blurred vision, and possibly nausea and vomiting. 6. In some cases, glaucoma can be caused by an injury, such as a blow to the eye, or by a condition that affects the shape of the eye, such as cataracts or Fuchs dystrophy. 7. Other risk factors for glaucoma include being age 60 or older, being Hispanic, having diabetes, and taking certain medications. 8. If you have open-angle glaucoma, you may not have any noticeable symptoms. However, if the condition is left untreated, it can cause gradual loss of peripheral vision, so that tunnel vision sets in. 9. If you have closed-angle glaucoma, you will probably have: 10.

Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. 2. People with LCA typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. 3. LCA is associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). 4. Affected individuals may also have what's known as strabismus, a misalignment or crossing of the eyes. 5. In addition to visual problems, people with LCA may have other health issues, including neurological problems such as seizures, mental retardation, and autism. 6. It's also possible to have LCA together with more common vision problems, such as myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism (an irregularly shaped cornea). 7. Infants with LCA typically have very poor vision and may not even recognize their parents. As children, they may learn to navigate the environment by using other senses and by memorizing the location of objects. 8.

They may not be able to see at all or see only shades of gray. 3. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time. Other features of LCA include abnormalities of the eye's pupil, which may appear larger or smaller than normal, and a lack of response to light. 4. Nystagmus, or eye movements that jerk back and forth, may also occur. 5. The eye's clear front covering (cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus. 6. In rare cases, LCA can be associated with other features, including mental retardation, psychiatric disorders, and a movement disorder similar to Parkinson's disease. 7. In most cases, LCA is caused by mutations in one of three genes. The gene responsible determines the specific symptoms a person will have. 8. Most people with LCA are born to parents with normal vision. When both parents have normal vision, the condition is referred to as autosomal recessive. 9. When LCA is caused by mutations in one of the three genes, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the gene needs to be changed for a person to have the condition. In most cases, people with an autosomal dominant form of LCA have no family history of the disorder. 10. The diagnosis of LCA is based on a combination of clinical features and genetic testing. There is no cure for LCA. Treatment may include specialized low-vision devices, such as magnifying glasses or telescopes, to improve vision."

"70-80% of small intestine can die overnight due to mesenteric ischemia, which is common in patient with atherosclerosis, which is common in old age people. The blood supply to the intestine may be blocked due to atherosclerotic plaque in the mesenteric artery. This causes the intestine to die.  The part of the intestine that is dead will need to be removed. The remaining intestine will need to adapt and increase its function in order to make up for the loss. This is possible because the small intestine has the ability to increase its function over time (adaptation).","1. Yes, it is reasonable because the small intestine has a very rich blood supply and any obstruction or compromise to blood flow can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the affected segment.2. The most common cause of small bowel ischemia is an embolic event to the superior mesenteric artery.3. Other causes include atherosclerosis, non-occlusive ischemia (low blood flow without an obstruction), and venous thrombosis.4. Non-occlusive ischemia is associated with conditions such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and shock.5. Venous thrombosis is associated with factors such as compression of the venous system by a mass (e.g., neoplasm, abscess, or hematoma), dehydration, and hypercoagulable states.6. In this case, the patient was found to have an obstructing lesion at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, which led to the bowel ischemia.7. The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, bloody loose bowel movements, and a large amount of small bowel that was necrotic at surgery indicates that the patient had a significant amount of small bowel ischemia.","1.

It is a vascular catastrophe that requires urgent intervention. Most of the time, it is due to emboli to the superior mesenteric artery or the iliac arteries. In this case, the patient had a myocardial infarction which would have caused a clot to be dislodged from the heart and embolize to the superior mesenteric artery. The patient was lucky that only 70-80% of the small intestine was removed because it is possible that the entire small intestine would have been necrotic. The large intestine was spared because it receives blood from the inferior mesenteric artery which is not branches off of the superior mesenteric artery. The large intestine would have been affected if the embolus had traveled to the inferior mesenteric artery. The ileum was spared because it is supplied by the ileocolic artery which is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery.","70-80% of the small intestine can be removed without any significant consequences to the patient. The remaining small intestine will undergo ""hyperplasia"" (increase in size) over the next several weeks to months, and will compensate for the removed intestine.","1) Yes, it is possible. 2) This is an example of a condition known as acute mesenteric ischemia. 3) This occurs when blood flow to the intestines is abruptly interrupted, usually due to a blood clot. 4) This can occur after a major trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident), or with a medical condition that causes blood clots to form (e.g., atrial fibrillation). 5) In this case, the patient likely had a blood clot form in his mesenteric arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the intestines). 6) This caused the intestinal tissue to become ischemic (lack blood flow) and necrotic (dead). 7) The necrotic tissue would then perforate (become holes in the intestines), leading to bacterial overgrowth and sepsis (a life-threatening infection). 8) This would explain why the patient went from eating dinner on Saturday to having a life-threatening intestinal issue requiring the removal of 70-80% of their small intestine and part of their large intestine by Tuesday."

However, it is important to note that not all genetic conditions can be detected with genetic testing.","Genetic testing can be used to diagnose genetic conditions even when symptoms are not yet present or are too subtle to detect.  Testing can also provide information about carrier status and the risk of passing on a genetic condition to children.  Testing can be performed on a patient at any age, but it may be more effective and/or necessary when performed after the onset of symptoms.  A genetic mutation can be detected through testing without a prior diagnosis, but the test may not provide a definitive answer.  In some cases, additional testing or a second opinion may be necessary.","Yes, genetic testing can be done without knowing the underlying illness. In fact, genetic testing is often performed on people who have no symptoms or health problems. This type of testing is called presymptomatic or predictive testing.

"1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. This condition is characterized by progressive bone changes that become evident during the first year of life. The changes include short stature, bowing of the legs, enlargement of the wrists and knuckles, and rounding of the shoulders. Affected children have normal intelligence. 2. Metatropic dysplasia. This is a rare condition characterized by short stature, bowing of the legs, and widening of the hips. Affected children have mild to severe intellectual disability. 3. Prenatal testing. Prenatal testing for these conditions is possible only if a specific gene mutation has been identified in a family member.","1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by short stature, short neck, pectus carinatum or excavatum, winged scapulae, short fourth metacarpals and epiphyseal changes at the knees and ankles. The disease has been linked to mutations in the COL2A1 gene, which encodes type II collagen. 2. Metatropic dysplasia is characterized by short stature, kyphoscoliosis, bowing of the long bones, waddling gait, and hypercalcemia. It is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. 3. The diagnosis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia can be confirmed by genetic testing. 4. Metatropic dysplasia can be distinguished from spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia by the presence of hypercalcemia.",1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) and metatropic dysplasia (MD) are two distinct skeletal dysplasias with overlapping clinical features. 2. The diagnosis of SED and MD can be established prenatally by USG and genetic analysis. 3. The key differences between SED and MD include the presence of spinal involvement in SED and absence of craniofacial dysmorphism in MD. 4. The presence of short middle phalanges of the 5th finger and short 4th metacarpal in SED and MD can be helpful in the diagnosis. 5. The presence of short middle phalanges of the 5th finger and short 4th metacarpal in SED and MD can be helpful in the diagnosis. 6.

It is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. 3. The two disorders can be distinguished by genetic testing. 4. Prenatal testing for spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is available. Testing for metatropic dysplasia is not available.","1. The term spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) comprises a group of disorders with skeletal abnormalities associated with abnormal growth. The term metatropic dysplasia (MD) is used to describe a specific type of SED characterized by early-onset of developmental and skeletal abnormalities. 2. SED and MD are genetic disorders caused by mutations in the COL 11A1 gene. 3. The COL 11A1 gene provides instructions for making type XI collagen, which is used to make a protein called type X collagen. This protein is a major component of cartilage and bone. 4. Mutations in the COL 11A1 gene result in abnormalities in the production of type X collagen, which affects the development and maintenance of bone and cartilage. 5. People with SED have mutations that disrupt the production of type X collagen to varying degrees. People with more severe mutations tend to have more pronounced symptoms. 6. The severity of the disorder can vary widely, even within the same family. Some people with SED have mild to moderate skeletal abnormalities, while others have severe abnormalities that result in death before or shortly after birth. 7. In people with SED, the skeletal abnormalities typically become more pronounced as the person gets older. 8. The most common features of SED include short stature, bowlegs, a curved spine (scoliosis), and abnormalities in the bones of the face. Other features of SED include cleft palate, clubfoot, and abnormalities of the eyes, heart, and kidneys. 9. In people with MD, the skeletal abnormalities are severe and usually present at birth or develop within the first few months of life. These abnormalities include bent legs, clubfeet, and abnormalities of the spine. People with MD also have characteristic facial features, including a broad forehead, widely spaced eyes, a short nose, and a small chin. Other features of MD include abnormalities of the eyes, heart, and kidneys. 10. Prenatal genetic testing can be performed on the mother's blood"

Nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline or xylometazoline are safe to use for most people. 3. Don't take OTC cold remedies that contain antihistamines. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine, which is found in many OTC cold remedies, can cause drowsiness and decrease your ability to drive, operate machinery, or perform other tasks that require focus and concentration. 4. If you need an antihistamine, use a pill instead of a liquid. Antihistamines in pills are absorbed more slowly than antihistamines in liquids. This means that you are less likely to have the side effects listed above. 5. Don't take OTC cold remedies that contain acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. These medicines are in many OTC cold remedies. Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. Taking too much aspirin can cause bleeding. Taking too much ibuprofen can cause stomach bleeding and other problems.",1. You can take pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion and headache. 2. Avoid decongestants that contain phenylephrine.

Graves' disease is an overactive thyroid gland due to an immune disorder. It is not contagious nor is it caused by a bacterial or viral infection. The thyroid gland makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy from food. People with Graves' disease make too much thyroid hormone, which causes the body's metabolism to be too active. This can lead to several symptoms including: a. weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, b. rapid or irregular heartbeat, c. feeling nervous or irritable, d. feeling very hot, e. tremors or shaking of the hands, and f. weak muscles and tiredness. 2. The treatment of Graves' disease depends on the severity of symptoms and whether there are any complications. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone that is made. This can be done with medicines, surgery, radioactive iodine, or a combination of these treatments. 3. People with Graves' disease should avoid eating soy products such as tofu and miso. Soy contains a substance called ""goitrogens"" that may interfere with thyroid hormone production. 4. The following over-the-counter cold medicines are safe for someone with Graves' disease: a. Acetaminophen for fever and headache b. Decongestants such as phenylephrine (Duramax) or pseudoephedrine (Phenylephrine, Pseudoephedrine) to relieve a stuffy nose. c.

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The disorder can be inherited (genetic) or acquired from an injury or other medical condition. 3. Causes include long-term use of diuretics (medicines that increase urine production) and other medicines, such as antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), that cause the kidneys to lose bicarbonate (HCO3). 4. A high level of acid in the blood may cause bone pain and muscle weakness or lead to bone loss (osteomalacia). 5. The condition is often associated with hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood). 6. In children, it may cause growth problems and may cause rickets (softening and weakening of the bones) and episodes of low blood calcium levels. 7. Renal tubular acidosis is diagnosed by testing the urine and blood for bicarbonate levels and by measuring the amount of acid in the blood. 8. Treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis may include taking potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. 9. Avoiding certain medicines that can damage the kidneys, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may prevent the condition.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. 2.

As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb bicarbonate (HCO3), which is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys. 3. The kidneys also do not properly secrete hydrogen ions (H+), which are normally secreted by the kidneys. 4. As a result, too much bicarbonate and too little acid are lost in the urine. 5. The bicarbonate that is lost in the urine leads to a decrease in the amount of bicarbonate in the blood (called hypobicarbonatemia). 6. Too little acid in the urine leads to an increase in the amount of acid in the blood (called hyperacidity). 7. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb sodium, which is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys. 8. As a result, too much sodium is lost in the urine. 9. The loss of too much sodium and the retention of too much water in the body leads to a decrease in the amount of sodium and an increase in the amount of water in the blood (called hyponatremia and hyponatremia, respectively). 10. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly reabsorb calcium, which is normally reabsorbed by the kidneys. 11. As a result, too much calcium is lost in the urine. 12.

As a result, bicarbonate is lost in the urine, which leads to a decrease in the amount of bicarbonate in the blood (called hypobicarbonatemia). 4. In addition, too much acid remains in the blood. 5. Distal renal tubular acidosis can be caused by inherited genetic mutations and can affect individuals of any age. 6. Treatment for distal renal tubular acidosis is based on the underlying cause and may include taking supplemental bicarbonate, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a condition in which too much acid is present in the blood. 2. The kidneys normally keep the amount of acid in the blood at a steady level. 3. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not remove enough acid from the blood. 4. As a result, too much acid is present in the blood (called acidosis). 5. This condition can lead to bone pain, growth problems, and kidney stones. 6. The condition is treated with medications and dietary changes. 7. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports research on kidney diseases. 8.

Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The most common type of distal renal tubular acidosis is due to a problem with the gene that makes the enzyme CAII. 3. Some cases of distal renal tubular acidosis are due to autoimmune disorders. 4. Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include: a. Early-morning waking b. Feeling tired c. Feeling weak d. Feeling irritable e. Feeling sad or depressed f. Loss of appetite g. Weight loss h. Abnormal heart rhythms i. Muscle pain or cramps j. Nausea or vomiting 5. Diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis may be suspected from a blood test that measures the bicarbonate level. A low bicarbonate level (below 21 mEq/L) is a sign that distal renal tubular acidosis may be present. 6. Other tests that may be done include: a. Urine tests to measure the amount of bicarbonate in the urine and the amount of acid in the urine b. Blood tests to measure the level of calcium and the level of blood acid (lactate) c.

"1. Introduction. Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) is a genetic disorder characterized by low birth weight, slow growth, weak muscles (hypotonia), and a specific pattern of physical abnormalities. 2. The most common features of Russell-Silver syndrome are a small and thin body and limbs with a relatively large head, and a small jaw (micrognathia). 3. Other common features include a small, triangular face, down-slanting eyes, and a small, wide nasal bridge. 4. Individuals with Russell-Silver syndrome may have a single crease across the palm of their hand instead of the normal two, and may have more folds of skin on the back of their neck (increased skin folds on neck). 5. Russell-Silver syndrome is also associated with a higher risk of developing some medical conditions, including Wilms tumor (a kidney tumor), neurologic problems, and developmental delay. 6. Russell-Silver syndrome is caused by changes in a specific gene (TCF2) which is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 11. 7. The TCF2 gene encodes for a transcription factor (protein that controls the expression of other genes) involved in regulating cell growth and development. 8. Russell-Silver syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. 9. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. 10. People with Russell-Silver syndrome are at risk for passing on the condition to their children. 11. Diagnosis. Diagnosis of Russell-Silver syndrome is based on the symptoms and physical examination. 12. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis, but genetic testing is not routinely available. 13. Russell-Silver syndrome is not associated with any specific treatment. Treatment is directed at the individual symptoms. 14. Prognosis.

"1. Recovery from stroke is a dynamic process that includes recovery of function at a site of brain damage as well as compensation for lost function through the use of alternative neural pathways and strategies. 2. The extent and time course of recovery after stroke depend on the size and location of the brain lesion, the degree of collateral damage, the rapidity of thrombolytic or neuroprotective intervention, the presence of coexisting brain damage, and the patient's age and previous physical and intellectual status. 3. The most complete recovery from a stroke occurs when the ischemia is caused by a transient insult, such as a thrombotic event, and no permanent brain damage has occurred. 4. The least complete recovery occurs when there is extensive infarction of brain tissue, as might occur with a cerebral embolism or hemorrhage. 5. The potential for compensation is greatest in the young and less in the elderly, in whom cerebral coex and neocortex are affected, and in whom there is a greater likelihood of permanent brain damage. 6. The potential for recovery is also reduced in the presence of coexisting Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or other degenerative disorders.",80% of stroke patients regain some or all of their functional ability.,90% of stroke survivors recover to an extent that they are able to resume their normal activities,"1. Inpatient rehabilitation generally lasts from 4 days to 4 weeks. It involves the patient, the family, and an interdisciplinary team of professionals. During this time, the patient learns new ways to manage ADLs and is given training in the use of special equipment. 2. The patient then returns to the home, where the family must carry on the rehabilitation program. This phase is the most critical in achieving an optimal level of function. 3. The patient is seen by the physician, the nurse, or other health care professional at intervals, usually every 2 weeks, until the patient's condition is stable.","1. Medical management: The patient is stabilized with medication and/or surgery. Medications may include anticoagulants to prevent recurrent stroke, antihypertensives to control blood pressure, diuretics to reduce fluid retention, and/or anticonvulsants to prevent seizures. Surgery may include procedures on the heart to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke (such as carotid endarterectomy or stenting, or heart valve repair or replacement). 2. Rehabilitation: The patient receives therapy to relearn skills and self-care activities that were lost due to the stroke.

Individuals with FHCC have variable symptoms that may include intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, spasticity, and cerebral palsy-like symptoms. FHCC is a genetic disorder that is usually inherited. Most people with FHCC have no family history of the disorder. FHCC is caused by a mutation in one of two genes, and usually occurs as a result of a new mutation. FHCC is not associated with any specific ethnic or geographic group. The prevalence of FHCC is unknown. It is estimated that 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 people have FHCC. FHCC is usually diagnosed in infants or in childhood. Diagnosis is based on imaging studies (CT or MRI scan) and clinical evaluation. There is no specific treatment for FHCC. Treatment is directed at the symptoms and may include medication for seizures, physical therapy, and special education. People with FHCC are of average height, and usually have a normal lifespan.
