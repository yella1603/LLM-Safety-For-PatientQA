"1. The amyloid protein is made up of fibrils that can be seen by staining. It can be present in any part of the body, but most commonly it is deposited in the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. 2. Cardiac amyloidosis occurs when amyloid deposits form in the heart. This condition is often first noticed during a routine checkup when an abnormal heart sound is heard. It can occur at any age but is most common in people over 50. 3. People with cardiac amyloidosis may not have any symptoms, or they may have symptoms related to their heart condition. 4. A diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is based on a combination of the patient's medical history and test results. The most common tests used to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis are echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (EKG), and cardiac MRI. 5. Treatment is aimed at slowing the heart rate and reducing the workload on the heart. Medicines that may be used include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. 6. Surgery may be used to treat specific problems such as abnormal heart rhythms. 7. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent heart failure. People with cardiac amyloidosis usually do not live long, but treatment may help people live longer.",1.

"There is not yet enough evidence to know which treatment type is best for which type of migraine.  The field of study is very young.  However, the latest research shows that those with a type of migraine called ""chronic"" are not helped by any of the treatments that have been developed to date.  Chronic migraine is the type that is present all of the time, not episodic.  The latest research shows that the chronic migraine is a type that is resistant to all of the treatments that have been developed over the last 20 years.  The latest research indicates that a type of migraine called ""chronic"" is resistant to all of the treatments that have been developed over the last 20 years.  This is not to say that treatments do not help at all, only that they are not very effective and there is much room for improvement.  If you would like to review some of the latest research on this subject, you can look at the following article:","1. Migraine with aura; 2. Migraine without aura; 3. Status migrainosus; 4. Chronic migraine; 5. Migraine with brainstem involvement; 6. Complicated migraine

Introduction: Migraine is a common and debilitating primary headache disorder, affecting approximately 15% of women and 6% of men over a one year period. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of throbbing head pain, usually lasting 4-72 hours, and associated with nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. Migraine can be classified as either with or without aura. Aura can present as visual, sensory or motor symptoms, and can precede or coincide with the headache phase. Chronic migraine is diagnosed when migraine headache occurs on 15 or more days per month for more than three months. In this review, we focus on clinical studies that have investigated specific migraine treatments for the different migraine conditions described above. Migraine with aura; The pathophysiology of aura is not fully understood, but it is thought to arise from slowly spreading neuronal hyperexcitability and/or depressed activity, affecting visual, sensory and motor pathways. Migraine aura can be classified as typical or atypical. Typical aura consists of a monocular visual aura, which may progress to a full hemianopic visual field defect, and/or homonymous hemisensory, and/or hemimotor symptoms. Atypical aura consists of non-typical aura symptoms, including speech disturbances, vertigo, clumsiness, and/or brainstem symptoms. Migraine without aura; In those patients in whom aura features are not present, the pathophysiology of migraine is less well understood. It is thought that the headache phase may arise as a result of neurogenic inflammation and/or dysfunction of the trigeminovascular system. Status migrainosus; In this review, we also consider the treatments for patients with status migrainosus, a severe, debilitating migraine that does not resolve despite the use of usual acute treatments for migraine. Chron",Research has identified several different types of migraines and is ongoing to identify the most effective treatment approach for each type.,1) Sumatriptan is the only medication currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of all migraine subtypes. 2) The efficacy of sumatriptan and other migraine treatments has not been adequately studied in the different migraine subtypes. 3) Future research should investigate the efficacy of treatments for the different migraine subtypes.,"1) Yes, there are studies that have attempted to categorize migraine treatments by their effectiveness against specific migraine subtypes. 2) Examples of specific migraine subtypes include: a) Basiliximab b) Eletriptan c) Ergotamine d) Frovatriptan e) Grepafloxacin f) Ibuprofen g) Lactobacillus acidophilus h) Metoclopramide i) Midrin j) Mometasone nasal spray k) Montelukast l) Naloxone m) Nefazodone n) Ondansetron o) Oxytocin p) Ropivacaine s) Sumatriptan t) Tizanidine u) Topiramate v) Verapamil These studies have found that some treatments are more effective for some subtypes than others. For example, the triptans are especially effective for migraine with aura, while the dopamine receptor antagonist metoclopramide is especially effective for migraine that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.",0 No scientific evidence. 1 Limited scientific evidence. 2 Some scientific evidence. 3 Good scientific evidence.

"Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism--the way the body uses energy--and affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the body's functions slow down.","1. Hypothyroidism may be due to congenital (born with it) or acquired (something that has happened to cause it to start later in life). 2. Most people with hypothyroidism are born with the condition and have no symptoms until later in life. 3. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. 4. Some causes of acquired hypothyroidism include thyroiditis, which is inflammation of the thyroid gland, and thyroid surgery. 5. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include feeling tired, gaining weight, constipation, having dry skin, and having mental and physical slowness. 6. In order to diagnose hypothyroidism, blood tests are done to measure the levels of thyroid hormones. 7. Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement pills. 8. Most people do very well on this treatment and feel much better after starting it.","Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism—the way the body uses energy—and affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the body's functions slow down. Hypothyroidism is often called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism may be due to:   - Hashimoto's disease—an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland   - Congenital hypothyroidism—hypothyroidism that is present at birth. It is usually caused by an inherited condition.   - Hypopituitarism—a condition in which the pituitary gland does not make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is a hormone that tells the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone.   - Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism—treatment that involves taking a small dose of radioactive iodine, which destroys some of the thyroid gland tissue. Over time, the remaining thyroid tissue makes more thyroid hormone.   - Some medicines, such as amiodarone, lithium, and iodides   - An overactive thyroid gland that has been treated with radioactive iodine   - Certain chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin","1.

Common causes of hypothyroidism include Hashimoto's disease, thyroiditis, thyroid surgery, radiation treatment, and certain medications. Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid to become underactive. Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can occur after pregnancy. 3. Symptoms of hypothyroidism can include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and difficulty concentrating. Women may have heavy or irregular menstrual periods. 4. Babies born to women with untreated hypothyroidism may fail to develop or function normally. Untreated hypothyroidism in children can cause physical and mental developmental delays. 5. Diagnosis of hypothyroidism involves blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels. Treatment involves thyroid hormone replacement, which typically requires a lifelong prescription.","Hypothyroidism is caused by an underactive thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is located in your neck, and it makes hormones that control the way every cell in your body uses energy. Hypothyroidism means your thyroid isn't making enough hormones. The most common cause is an autoimmune disorder. Other causes include thyroid surgery, radiation treatment, and inflammation. Some people are born with hypothyroidism. It develops slowly, and you might not notice anything. Symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, and depression. You might also feel cold, have trouble concentrating, and feel anxious. If you're pregnant, you might have a miscarriage or a stillbirth. If you have heart disease, hypothyroidism can make it worse. If you have high cholesterol, it can raise your risk of heart disease.","1. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs. 2. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. It makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy from food. The thyroid uses iodine to make two main hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones control the way every cell in the body uses energy from food. 3. Hypothyroidism is often caused by Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid. The thyroid gland may also be damaged by radiation treatment to the neck, by too much or too little iodine in the diet, or by certain medicines. 4. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, and muscle cramps. A woman may have heavy periods and become infertile. Other symptoms include feeling cold, depression, memory problems, and trouble concentrating. 5. To diagnose hypothyroidism, the doctor may order blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels. If these levels are low, the doctor may order more tests to find out the cause. 6. Treatment involves taking a pill every day that contains the correct amount of thyroid hormone. It takes time for the body to start working normally again. The doctor will check hormone levels and may adjust the dose of medicine. Most people need to take the medicine for life."

Technical Explanation: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare inherited disorder that affects the breakdown of certain amino acids, specifically the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. 

The disease is due to mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes, which encode the proteins that make up the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This enzyme complex is responsible for the breakdown of BCAAs in the liver. 

MSUD is characterized by feeding problems, vomiting, ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, and neurological problems such as developmental delays and seizures. Without proper treatment, it can lead to coma and death. 

The treatment of MSUD involves a special diet, vitamin supplementation, and a medication called thiamine. The diet must be strictly controlled to ensure that the patient does not receive high amounts of the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which cannot be broken down in the body. With proper treatment, patients can lead relatively normal lives.","1. Mutations in the BCKD gene cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder characterized by feeding difficulties, slow growth, and neurological problems. 2. Mutations in the BCKD gene cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder characterized by feeding difficulties, slow growth, and neurological problems. It is caused by a buildup of the amino acids branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) in the blood. 3. Mutations in the BCKD gene prevent the production of the enzymes that break down BCAAs. Without these enzymes, BCAAs build up in the body, especially in the brain, liver, and kidneys. 4. As a result, affected individuals cannot process BCAAs, which are essential for normal growth and development. 5. Without treatment, affected infants develop severe brain damage and die within the first few days or weeks of life. 6. Treatment requires a special diet and, in some cases, medications. The diet must be carefully planned to prevent the build-up of BCAAs. Supplements of BCAAs and the amino acids that are made from BCAAs are often prescribed. 7. With treatment, children with MSUD can grow and develop normally, although neurological problems may persist.","1. The genetic change in Maple Syrup Urine Disease is a deficiency of the enzyme branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, which is necessary for the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) that are present in many foods, especially protein-rich foods like milk and meat. 2. The genetic change is detected by a blood test that measures the levels of the branched-chain amino acids in the blood. 3. The chromosomal change is unknown. 4. There is no cure for MSUD. Treatment involves strict dietary management, including the restriction of the branched-chain amino acids.","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together to process the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These amino acids are essential for growth and development. 2. Mutations in any of these three genes can prevent the proteins from working normally (i.e., dysfunctional protein). With dysfunctional protein, an individual cannot process leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. 3. The buildup of these amino acids and byproducts can be harmful to many organs, including the brain, liver, and kidneys. This buildup is thought to interfere with normal brain development early in life. 4. In the brain, the amino acids and byproducts can lead to swelling and neurological problems, including seizures, poor muscle control, intellectual disability, and developmental delays."
"1. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a defect in the diaphragm -- the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen -- that allows organs from the abdomen to enter the chest cavity. CDH occurs in about one out of every 2,000 births. 2. CDH is a serious medical condition that requires immediate medical attention. The condition is present at birth, but symptoms may not be obvious until later in life. 3. CDH causes the abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding prevents the lungs from functioning properly. The condition is also called a diaphragmatic hernia. 4. A baby with CDH may have poor muscle tone or be born in breathing difficulties. The abdomen may appear bloated and the ribs may be uneven. The baby may turn blue (cyanosis) and have a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). 5. In severe cases, the baby may be unable to breathe and could die. 6. In less severe cases, a baby with CDH may be able to breathe with the help of a ventilator. The baby may need medication to help the heart and lungs work. 7. Surgery may be needed to repair the diaphragm and return the abdominal organs to the abdomen. 8. The cause of CDH was previously thought to be a genetic mutation, but this is now thought to be unlikely. Current research indicates that the most common cause of CDH is a defect in the neural crest. The neural crest is a group of cells that migrate during fetal development and form many of the body's structures, including the diaphragm. 9. CDH can be detected before birth using ultrasound and other imaging tests. In some cases, the condition may be detected using an ultrasound done for other reasons. 10. The most common complication of CDH is a hole in the lung (pneumothorax). A less common but serious complication is a narrowing of the stomach and esophagus (stricture). This complication occurs in about 10 percent of CDH babies. 1","1. Yes, CDH can be passed down to future generations, and the term 'congenital' implies a risk of passing it down. 2. The condition can be passed down through germline (inherited) or somatic (acquired after conception) mutations in the CDH gene. 3. The risk of passing it down depends on the specific mutation present.","1. Yes, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can be passed on to subsequent generations. It is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that controls production of the protein elastin. 2. Because the gene that causes CDH is inherited, there is a chance that a fetus or child could inherit the condition from a parent who also has the gene. 3. In most cases, the genetic defect occurs sporadically. This means that the mutated gene is a new occurrence in that particular pregnancy. 4. In some instances, the mutated gene is inherited from a parent. In those cases, the child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition. 5. A genetic counselor can help determine the risk of passing on the condition.","1. Yes, CDH is a hereditary condition. 2. The term 'congenital' indicates that the condition is present at birth. In this case, the condition is present because of a genetic change that was present in the sperm or egg of the affected person's parent. 3. A genetic change that is present in the sperm or egg of a parent is called a mutation. Mutations can be inherited from one generation to the next.","1. CDH is a condition that is present from birth (congenital) but may not be inherited. 2. CDH is a result of defects in the development of the diaphragm during pregnancy and may result from malformations in the genes responsible for lung and diaphragm development. 3. In some cases, CDH can be associated with other genetic conditions involving chromosomal abnormalities. 4. Genetic counseling is recommended for anyone with a family history of CDH.",1. Denoting something that is present at birth. 2. Denoting an abnormality that is present at birth and that has a strong familial tendency.

"1. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart. The extent of the opening can vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous portion. The membranous septum is an extension of the membranous portion of the interatrial septum, and the muscular septum is a continuation of the ventricular free wall. The membranous septum lies next to the right ventricle and is separated from it by the right ventricular outflow tract, which consists of the pulmonary valve, and the left and right ventricular outflow tracts. The muscular septum lies next to the left ventricle and is separated from it by the left ventricular outflow tract, which consists of the aortic valve. The right and left ventricular outflow tracts connect to the pulmonary artery and aorta respectively, and the two great arteries are connected by the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that allows blood to bypass the lungs in the fetus. The VSD is usually located at the membranous or the muscular portion of the ventricular septum. 2. Atrial septal defect (ASD) is an abnormal opening between the two atria of the heart. The most common location for an ASD is in the region of the fossa ovalis, an oval-shaped depression in the wall between the right and left atria. The superior and inferior venae cavae connect to the right atrium, and the pulmonary veins connect to the left atrium. Normally, the only exit for blood from the left atrium is the mitral valve, which leads to the left ventricle and then to the aorta for distribution throughout the body. The right atrium has two exits, the tricuspid valve leading to the right ventricle, and the pulmonary valve leading to the pulmonary artery. However, in the case of an ASD, blood can flow from the left atrium to the right atrium because the","1.

People who smoke are 13 times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. 4. Secondhand smoke can also increase the risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers. 5. Smoking marijuana cigarettes has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. 6. The greatest risk of lung cancer is for those who started smoking at a young age. 7. In addition to smoking, there are other risk factors for lung cancer. 8. People who breathe in radon or who are exposed to asbestos or arsenic are at increased risk. 9. Lung cancer risk increases with age.10. Most lung cancers are diagnosed when the disease has reached an advanced stage. 11. Screening is used to identify lung cancer before symptoms appear. 12. Screening may include chest x-rays, CT scans, or PET scans.13. If a screening test shows an abnormal area in the lungs, a biopsy will be done. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of lung tissue is removed. 14. Biopsy samples can be examined under a microscope to see if cancer cells are present.15. A diagnosis of lung cancer can be confirmed only by lung biopsy. 16. Once lung cancer has been diagnosed, the stage of the disease should be determined. 17. Staging is a process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. 18. A doctor will use a physical exam, blood tests, and imaging studies to determine the stage of the disease. 19. In addition to staging, doctors use what is called ""tumor staging"" to describe the characteristics of a particular tumor. 20. Tumor staging considers the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. 21. There are four stages of lung cancer, and each stage is given a Roman numeral from I to IV. 22. The higher the number, the more advanced the cancer. 2","Yes, if your husband's family has a history of lung cancer that suggests a hereditary lung cancer syndrome, genetic testing may be helpful. A genetic counselor will collect your husband's family history, including medical records and death certificates, and may perform a detailed review of the medical literature. The counselor will then discuss the likelihood that your husband's family has a hereditary lung cancer syndrome, and the risks and benefits of testing. If your husband is interested in being tested, a blood sample will be collected and sent to a genetic testing laboratory. There, scientists will look for any specific gene changes that may have caused or contributed to lung cancer in your husband's family. Testing may be done to look for changes in a specific gene, such as the EGFR gene or the KRAS gene, which are known to be involved in some hereditary lung cancer syndromes. Or testing may be done to look for all the known gene changes that might be involved in hereditary lung cancer. Testing may also be done to look for gene changes that cause other types of cancer, such as colon or breast cancer, which may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Results of genetic testing may provide information about your husband's risk of developing lung cancer, and may affect decisions about screening and prevention.","No, Not Necessarily. Results from genetic tests of your mother-in-law, your husband, and his sisters may or may not show that the lung cancer is inherited. The tests may indicate that the cancer is not inherited. Or they may show that the cancer is likely inherited, but not who in the family has the gene that causes the cancer.  It is important to talk with a health care provider who specializes in cancer genetics about your family history before considering any genetic tests.","Yes, a family history of lung cancer can be due to inherited genetic mutations.  Genetic testing can determine if your husband's family has a known genetic predisposition to lung cancer.  The most common known genetic predisposition is due to mutations in the EGFR gene.  Other known genetic mutations include KRAS, ALK, BRAF, and RET.  If your husband's family has a known genetic predisposition, you may be at increased risk for lung cancer.  You should talk to your doctor about your risk and options for screening and prevention.","1. If your husband is at risk for lung cancer, he may be at risk because of his family history. 2.

"1. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder which means that two copies of the gene must be affected for an individual to be affected.  In most cases, people with Friedreich ataxia inherit one copy of the gene from a parent and the other copy is from a spontaneous mutation.  The spontaneous mutation is a random event and occurs by chance.  It is possible for the spontaneous mutation to occur more than once in the same family.  When this happens, individuals are said to be ""homozygous"" for the disease.  When a person is homozygous for Friedreich ataxia, they are more severely affected with the disease than heterozygous individuals.  2. Friedreich ataxia affects many parts of the body, including the heart, nerves, eyes, and skeletal system.  Most people with Friedreich ataxia will develop the inability to walk (called ""ataxia"") by the time they reach adolescence.  They may also develop weakness in their hands and difficulty with speech and swallowing.  People with Friedreich ataxia often develop a curvature of the spine and foot deformities.  As the disease progresses, the muscles of the heart and respiratory system may weaken, making it difficult for individuals to breathe or to pump blood efficiently.  Most people with Friedreich ataxia also develop a type of diabetes called ""insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).""  Some people with Friedreich ataxia experience loss of sensation in their arms and legs (called ""peripheral neuropathy""), which can result in minor cuts and bruises going unnoticed and thus becoming infected.  As people with Friedreich ataxia age, they may develop scoliosis, kyphosis, foot deformities, and cardiac complications.  3. Currently, there is no cure for Friedreich ataxia.

You need to consult a lawyer who would help you with this.",1. Small bowel ischemia and reperfusion injury results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. 2. The gold standard for the diagnosis of small bowel ischemia is laparotomy with direct visualization of the small bowel. 3. The most common causes of small bowel ischemia are arterial embolism and arterial thrombosis. 4. Small bowel ischemia usually presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. 5. Prompt surgical exploration is the most important step in the treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia.,"12-hour delay in the ER did contribute to her demise. Bowel ischemia is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. When diagnosed, immediate surgical intervention is usually the treatment of choice. Bowel ischemia occurs when the blood supply to the intestines is blocked or reduced, which can lead to tissue death and gangrene. The blockage can be caused by a blood clot (thrombus), an atherosclerotic plaque (fatty deposit) in an artery, or a twist or narrowing in the artery (stenosis). Bowel ischemia can result from conditions such as a heart attack, aneurysm, or abdominal aneurysm. The longer the bowel remains ischemic, the less likely it is to recover. If the ischemic segment is short, surgical resection (removal) of the affected bowel may be all that is needed. However, when the ischemic segment is long, a bypass procedure (vascular surgery) may be needed. Bowel resection and anastomosis is a surgical procedure in which a diseased section of intestine is removed and the healthy ends are reconnected. This is a common surgical procedure for bowel ischemia. In some cases, when the affected bowel is too badly damaged, a colostomy may be necessary. A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made in the colon and the remaining bowel is diverted through it. The colostomy allows stool to exit the body through the opening. It may be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of the disease and the healing process. In your mother's case, the surgeon had to remove most of her small intestine due to the gangrene. However, even with prompt surgical intervention, the outcome can be poor due to compromised intestinal blood supply.","1. It is very difficult to say whether or not the delay in the treatment has contributed to the death of your mother.2. The condition of your mother must have been very bad when she was seen by the general surgeon, and hence he might have thought that nothing could be done.3. The condition must have worsened in the ICU, and hence, it would not have been possible to save her life.4. The doctors must have done their best under the circumstances.","12 hours is a long time to wait before a general surgeon was able to see your mother. Bowel Ischemia and Septic Shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and intervention.  The sooner the condition is treated, the greater the chance for survival.  Unfortunately, once the condition progresses to a certain point, even with treatment, the chances of survival decrease.  In your mother's case, the delay in diagnosis and treatment may have contributed to her passing away.","1. I'm sorry for your loss.2. Bowel ischemia occurs due to a lack of blood flow to the intestines.3. It can be caused by a number of factors including atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), emboli (blood clots), or a narrowing of the arteries due to inflammation associated with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous or vasculitis.4. It can also be caused by a condition called a volvulus which occurs when a loop of bowel twists causing a blockage of blood flow and subsequent bowel ischemia.5. Septic Shock is a condition in which bacteria in the bloodstream release toxins that cause blood vessels to dilate (open up) allowing fluid to leak out into the surrounding tissues causing a decrease in blood volume and a subsequent decrease in blood pressure.6. A combination of bowel ischemia and septic shock can be a fatal combination.7. I hope that answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."

"1. You have not mentioned what type of albinism. There are various types of it.2. Albinism is a condition that affects the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin, hair and eyes.3. There are several different types of albinism, some of which also affect the eyes and vision.4. Oculocutaneous albinism, the most common form of albinism, affects the production of melanin in the skin, hair and eyes.5. Hermansky-Pudlack syndrome is a rare, inherited form of albinism that primarily affects the eyes and vision. It also can cause abnormalities in the skin and hair.6. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that affects the immune system and causes a low level of white blood cells. It also causes albinism and other problems.7. Albinism can be detected before or soon after birth. In infants with albinism, the skin, hair and eyes are very light. The eyes will appear very pale, and in bright light, a red reflex is visible in the eyes. As the child grows, the skin and hair may darken somewhat.8. As people with albinism age, their skin may develop freckles and moles, and their hair may gray.9. Albinism is a lifelong condition. There is no cure.","Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. I have read your query. Albinism is an inherited condition which is characterized by decreased production of melanin. Melanin is responsible for color of skin, hair and eyes. In your case it seems you have Oculocutaneous albinism. You can consult dermatologist for further evaluation. Molecular testing of the gene for albinism will be helpful in future offspring. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.","1. Albinism is a group of genetic disorders that results in little or no production of the pigment melanin, which determines the color of the skin, hair and eyes. 2. There are several different types of albinism, which are classified according to the type of pigment affected and the mode of inheritance. 3. In your case, you are born with Albinism, your hair is brown, your eyes are hazel and stable, and your skin is fair with visible markings that vary in shade. This means that your type of albinism is Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). 4. OCA is the most common type of albinism. It is caused by mutations in one of several genes that are essential for the synthesis of melanin. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 5. Individuals with OCA have little or no melanin in their skin, hair and eyes. Hair may be light brown to white, and eyes may be blue, hazel, or green. Individuals with OCA often have increased sensitivity to sun exposure due to the lack of protective melanin pigment, and may suffer from certain vision problems due to the absence of melanin in the eye. 6. In rare cases, individuals with OCA may have some areas of the skin that produce melanin. This condition is called piebaldism. 7. You can consult an Ophthalmologist for further guidance. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","1. Albinism is a group of genetic disorders that results in little or no production of the pigment melanin, which determines the color of the skin, hair and eyes. 2. A person with albinism typically has white or very light skin, light brown or blonde hair, and light blue or hazy eyes. But your skin has visible markings with three different levels of pigmentation. 3. There are other forms of albinism that do not match this classic ""blonde, blue-eyed"" image. 4. One type of non-classic albinism is called type 4 albinism or oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4). People with this type of albinism might have some pigment in their skin and hair, and their eyes might not be blue. 5. People with OCA4 might also have vision problems, including problems with depth perception. 6. I suggest you consult with a geneticist to determine what type of albinism you have.","1) The diagnosis of albinism is based on clinical observation and examination of the skin, hair and eyes. Other tests are not usually needed. 2) There are several forms of albinism, each with distinctive features. The different forms are classified according to the underlying genetic defect. 3) In some cases, a skin biopsy may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and determining the type of albinism. 4) Other tests, such as blood tests or eye examinations, are not likely to be helpful in determining the type of albinism.","Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA forum.  As you describe, you are having a rare type of albinism, as most of the people with albinism have black hair and brown eyes.  You might be having Chediak Higashi syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder, with albinism as one of its symptoms.  Other symptoms of this disorder include immune system problems, bleeding problems, and recurrent infections.  In this disorder, the body makes abnormal proteins (called lysosomal trafficking regulator proteins) that are needed for lysosomes to function normally. Lysosomes are small organelles within cells that contain substances that help fight infections and assist in the breakdown of many different types of molecules.  The abnormal protein causes lysosomes to function improperly.  As a result, the immune system and the body's ability to fight infections are impaired.  This condition usually results in early death.  The only known effective treatment is bone marrow transplantation.  Hope this answers your query. Regards"

Over-the-counter medicines, such as wart-removal products, do not work very well. 5. Two treatments that a doctor can do are: - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy); - Burning the wart (electrocautery); 6. Sometimes a wart will need to be removed with a small surgical procedure.  7. Do not scratch the wart or the skin around it.  8. Some warts can be prevented by using a vaccine. 9. To prevent warts, avoid touching somebody else's wart, and do not pick at your own warts.","1. Wart treatments may require more than one visit to a doctor's office. The doctor will probably remove any warts that can be easily scraped off. Then, if the warts return, the doctor may burn the growths away with chemicals or freeze them with liquid nitrogen. 2. Over-the-counter wart medicines may also be used. These medicines may contain podophyllin, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide. 3. Do not use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. 4. You can also buy a special tool to remove warts at home. This tool is a small, sharp knife that you use to cut away warts. 5. To prevent warts in other areas of your body, avoid touching the warts. Also avoid shaving the area around the warts. Use a clean washcloth and towel when bathing. Do not allow anyone to touch the warts."
"1. It is not clear what disease you are referring to. 2. Myopia is a refractive error of the eye not a disease. It is common and can be corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses. 3. Low vision is treated by a number of methods.

Yes, there is hope of recovery from this X-linked disease; 2. No, you cannot expect to see normally like others. 3. This is a disease called 'Nyctalopia' which is also known as 'X-linked Congenital Stationary Night Blindness' (CSNB). It is characterized by a defect in the rod photoreceptor cells of the retina. 4. The symptoms include poor night vision, difficulty in seeing at dawn and dusk, and sensitivity to light. 5. The affected males of the family can pass the disease to their male children only. 6. No treatment is known for this disease; therefore, you should wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. 7. You can also use light amplification devices (LADs) which will help you see better in low light conditions.","1. Your family has a history of a particular disease, with your maternal grandfather and brother also affected.2. You all have trouble seeing in low light, even during the day, and have myopia that makes it hard to see small objects clearly.3. This could be a case of night blindness or color vision deficiency.4.

The most common treatment for myopia is wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses. 3. In some cases, laser vision correction may be an option. 4. The goal of this study is to learn more about how myopia develops and to explore new ways to treat the condition. 5. The study will look at how myopia affects the back of the eye (the retina) and whether drugs can be used to treat myopia or prevent it from progressing.","1) Yes, there is a chance for recovery from this X-linked disease as you have mentioned that your maternal grandfather and brother had the same problem. 2) Your maternal grandfather and brother had the same problem because of a genetic defect in the visual photoreceptor cells of the retina. 3) This defect is associated with a gene called ""Retinol-Binding Protein Gene"" (RBP1) which is located on the X chromosome. 4) Because the gene is located on the X chromosome, it is called an X-linked disease. X-linked diseases are usually more severe in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome. 5) The photoreceptor cells of males with an affected RBP1 gene cannot properly convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for processing into vision. 6) The photoreceptor cells of females with an affected RBP1 gene can function better than the photoreceptor cells of males with an affected RBP1 gene because females have 2 X chromosomes. 7) So, females have a better chance of recovery from this X-linked disease than males."

"1. Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents into the small intestine.2. Gastroparesis is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management.3. It can be caused by a number of conditions, including:  - Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (such as diabetes, amyloidosis, scleroderma, and Parkinson disease)  - Neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury)  - Vagus nerve damage (such as from surgery)  - Side effect of certain medications (such as anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and opioids)4. Symptoms vary from mild to severe, depending on how much the stomach is slowed.5. Mild symptoms include:  - Bloating  - Nausea  - Vomiting  - Early satiety (feeling full after eating a small amount of food)  - Abdominal pain6. Severe symptoms include:  - Dehydration  - Malnutrition  - Weight loss7. Diagnosis may be suspected based on your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order tests such as:  - Barium swallow study  - Gastric emptying scan  - Blood test (to check glucose level and hemoglobin A1c)8. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms. Your doctor may recommend dietary changes, medications, and, in some cases, surgery.9. Dietary changes include eating many small meals throughout the day. Avoiding fatty foods, fried foods, and caffeine may also help.10.

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying, which results in the inability of the stomach to properly empty its contents. Gastroparesis is a chronic condition that requires careful management to avoid complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, and bezoar formation.2. Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of gastroparesis. Other causes include: Viral infections (eg, norovirus), medications (eg, opioids, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics), neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis), autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma), infections (eg, botulism, spirochetal infections), and malignancy.3. The diagnosis of gastroparesis is based on the clinical picture, with upper GI symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and early satiety, and a history of delayed gastric emptying documented by radiologic tests.4. The first line of treatment for gastroparesis is dietary modification and small, frequent meals. Medications, such as metoclopramide and domperidone, are also commonly used, but usually provide only marginal benefit.5. In cases of recurrent aspiration and bezoars, feeding bypassing the stomach can be used (eg, nasoenteric tube, gastrostomy, gastrojejunostomy). Other methods of feeding include percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, percutaneous jejunostomy, and elective surgical gastrostomy or jejunostomy. In cases of recurrent aspiration, a feeding jejunostomy may be indicated.6. Parenteral nutrition may be indicated if the patient is unable to obtain adequate nutrition by the enteral route.","Gastroparesis is a condition in which the muscles of your stomach don't work well. It slows down the movement of food from your stomach to your small intestine. Gastroparesis is often associated with other medical conditions, such as diabetes or thyroid problems.

"1. Type 1 diabetes is due to lack of insulin production by pancreas. 2. Insulin injections are the mainstay of treatment. 3. Daily insulin requirement varies according to blood glucose levels, diet, physical activity, and emotional stress. 4. It is important to monitor blood glucose levels frequently to determine the appropriate amount of insulin to be taken at any given time. 5. Type 1 diabetes cannot be cured, and treatment involves managing the condition with insulin, diet, and exercise. 6. Complications of type 1 diabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and high blood sugar levels), heart disease, kidney disease, and eye disease, including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy. 7. People with type 1 diabetes must also be vigilant in preventing other health problems, such as infections. 8. Regular blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of type 1 diabetes management.","1. A person with type 1 diabetes is at risk for a health condition called diabetic kidney disease. This can lead to kidney failure. To help prevent diabetic kidney disease, your friend should: a. Keep his blood glucose level in good control. b. Take any medicines prescribed by his doctor. c. Visit his doctor right away if he has any signs of kidney failure, such as swelling in his face, feet, and hands. 2. A person with type 1 diabetes is also at risk for a health condition called diabetic eye disease. This can lead to problems with his vision, even blindness. To help prevent diabetic eye disease, your friend should: a. Keep his blood glucose level in good control. b. Get his eyes checked once a year. c. See his eye doctor right away if he has vision problems. 3. High blood glucose levels can lead to gum disease and tooth loss. To help prevent this, your friend should brush his teeth twice a day and floss every day. He should also visit his dentist at least twice a year. 4. Your friend should talk to his doctor about getting a flu shot every year. This can help protect him from getting sick. He should also talk to his doctor about getting other vaccines as needed. 5. Men who have type 1 diabetes are at risk for erectile dysfunction (ED). Talking to his doctor and being honest about any ED problems he has can help him get the help he needs. 6. Women with type 1 diabetes are at risk for pregnancy complications. This includes problems with their baby. Talking to his doctor about family planning can help him make the best choices for himself and his future child. 7.

However, good control of blood glucose can delay the appearance of complications.","1. The most common long-term complication of type 1 diabetes is damage to the small blood vessels and nerves. High blood glucose levels over a period of years can cause damage to the blood vessels that supply nerves. This is called diabetic neuropathy. Damaged blood vessels can't provide the nerves with the oxygen and nutrients they need to work properly. As a result, nerves can become damaged and stop working. 2. Diabetes also can damage blood vessels in the retina of the eye. This damage can lead to vision loss. 3. Diabetes also can lead to kidney damage. The kidneys can lose function and eventually stop working. This is called kidney failure. 4. Diabetes also can lead to heart disease. Heart attack and stroke are the most common causes of death in people with diabetes. 5. Nerve damage to the extremities (arms and legs) can occur. This condition is called diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 6. People with diabetes also have a greater risk of developing certain kinds of cancer. People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. People with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop liver cancer and pancreatic cancer.",The chronic complications of type 1 diabetes develop over time. They involve damage to the small blood vessels and nerves. Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye. This can lead to vision loss. Diabetes also can damage the small blood vessels and nerves in the kidneys. This can lead to kidney failure. Diabetes also can cause problems with the small blood vessels and nerves in the feet. It can take months or years for diabetic neuropathy or diabetic retinopathy to develop. Nerve damage can cause numbness and pain in the limbs. Damage to the small blood vessels in the retina can cause loss of vision. Damage to the small blood vessels and nerves in the kidneys can lead to kidney failure. Damage to the small blood vessels in the feet can lead to loss of foot ulcers and gangrene. Gangrene is the death of tissue. It is usually caused by a lack of blood flow.,"1) Nephropathy: Diabetes can damage the kidneys. The first stage is called nephropathy, or damage to the small vessels in the kidney. This stage does not cause any symptoms. The blood pressure may be normal at this point, but it is very important to protect the kidneys from further damage. Blood pressure control, using ACE inhibitors or ARBs if there is high blood pressure, is important. A low-protein diet is also important. Yearly urine microalbuminuria testing is important to see if the kidneys are leaking albumin. 2) Neuropathy: Diabetes can damage the nerves, causing pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the hands, feet, and other areas. Controlling the blood sugar and cholesterol help protect against nerve damage. 3) Retinopathy: Diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the eyes. This can lead to vision loss. Yearly eye exams are important to see if there is any damage. 4) Foot problems: Diabetes can damage the blood vessels and nerves to the feet. This can lead to loss of feeling in the feet and make it harder to notice cuts and sores. Proper foot care, including daily examinations of the feet, is important."

Symptomatic relief can be obtained with local anesthetic gels (lidocaine), anticonvulsant medications (e.g., gabapentin, Pregabalin), and clonazepam. 3) You can try using these medications. However, the treatment will depend on the cause. If the cause is determined, it can be treated accordingly.",The results of the study were published in the January 2014 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.  The lead author is Dr. Albe J. Berger.  The paper can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24340808.  The take home message is that a defect in a sodium channel in the nerve cells of the tongue is responsible for burning mouth syndrome.  The defect is in a sodium channel called Nav1.7.  This channel is found only in the nerve cells of the tongue.  The defect causes a continuous internal signal to be sent from the tongue to the brain. This signal is interpreted by the brain as pain. The paper shows that a drug called oxcarbazepine that is currently used to treat epilepsy and a pain disorder called trigeminal neuralgia is able to block this sodium channel and stop the signal of pain from the tongue to the brain.  The paper also shows that people who suffer from burning mouth syndrome have a high level of this sodium channel in their nerve cells of the tongue.  The next step is to take this information and start a clinical trial in people who have burning mouth syndrome.,"1. We have found that the burning mouth symptoms can be reduced by using a mouthwash containing a compound called stavudine (which is an anti-viral agent normally used to treat HIV). 2. We are now conducting a clinical trial to determine whether stavudine is an effective long-term treatment for burning mouth syndrome. 3. It is likely that the results of this trial will be published in 2017, and if stavudine proves to be an effective treatment, we hope that it will be available for use in 2018.","The researchers are in the process of setting up a clinical trial through the National Institutes of Health. The trial is expected to take place over the next two years. If successful, the researchers will seek FDA approval for the device, a process that can take several years. The device would likely be a Class II medical device, which is subject to less stringent FDA scrutiny than a new drug.","1. The exact etiology of burning mouth syndrome is still unclear, although various causes have been proposed, such as a deficiency of the salivary protective mechanisms, a local inflammation of the oral mucosa, psychological factors, an abnormality of the central nervous system, an autoimmune process, and a viral or fungal infection. 2. The lack of a specific diagnostic test and the many proposed etiologies have made the development of a specific treatment difficult. 3. Many different medications and therapies have been suggested as potential treatments for burning mouth syndrome, although few of these have been evaluated in well-designed clinical studies. 4. The most commonly used medications for the treatment of burning mouth syndrome are those that possess anti-inflammatory properties, such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antihistamines. 5. In addition, many clinicians also recommend topical anesthetics and analgesics for patients with severe symptoms. 6. The use of cognitive-behavioral therapy has also been suggested as a possible method for reducing the symptoms associated with burning mouth syndrome. 7. The future of the treatment of burning mouth syndrome will likely involve a more complete understanding of the etiology of this condition, which should lead to the development of specific treatments that will enable clinicians to effectively treat this challenging condition.",1. We are in the process of filing a patent for the device and hope to have it available for clinical trials within the next year. 2. The device will be manufactured in the United States and we will seek FDA approval once we have the results from the clinical trials. 3. We expect the treatment will be available within 18 months of FDA approval.

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder of the kidneys that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2. The most common cause of dRTA is a problem with a protein in the kidney called the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter. This protein is responsible for moving sodium and bicarbonate (HCO3-) into the tubules. If this protein is defective, the kidneys cannot properly remove acid from the blood. 3. dRTA is usually present at birth (congenital). It develops during the first few years of life. Infants with dRTA often have feeding problems, slow growth, and episodes of vomiting and dehydration. 4. Other causes of dRTA include autoimmune disorders (in which the body's immune system attacks one of its own proteins), kidney stones, obstructions in the kidney, and some medications. 5. The symptoms of dRTA vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. People with dRTA may have symptoms such as: - frequent urination - dry mouth - constipation - muscle aches and pains - bone pain - feeling tired and weak - feeling short of breath - kidney stones 6. In addition to the above symptoms, people with dRTA due to a defect in the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter may also have: - a high blood acid level (metabolic acidosis) - low blood levels of potassium and/or calcium - low blood levels of sodium and/or bicarbonate 7. Diagnosis of dRTA is based on a physical exam, a thorough medical history, and laboratory tests. The doctor may also order imaging studies and nerve tests to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. 8. Treatment of dRTA varies depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In general, people with dRTA need to take sodium bicarbonate and/or potassium citrate supplements to reduce or prevent the buildup of acid in the blood.","1) Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by a defect in the kidney's ability to acidify the urine. 2) dRTA is a cause of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. 3) The most common form of dRTA is due to a deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II. 4) Infants with dRTA often present with hypotension, vomiting, dehydration, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. 5) The diagnosis of dRTA is made by a careful history and physical examination, and by measuring the urinary pH and urine and serum electrolytes after a careful water deprivation test. 6) Treatment of dRTA is with large amounts of alkali (bicarbonate tablets, usually 2-3 tablets every 6 hours).","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a rare disease characterized by low serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration and systemic metabolic acidosis resulting from impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the distal nephron. 2. The most common form of dRTA is due to carbonic anhydrase (CA) deficiency. 3. CA is a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes the rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons within the proximal renal tubule. 4. CA deficiency causes reduced bicarbonate reabsorption by the distal nephron, resulting in bicarbonate wasting and, consequently, metabolic acidosis. 5. A rare form of dRTA due to mutations in the ATP6N gene (encoding the anion exchanger AE2) has been described. 6. Other causes of dRTA include autosomal recessive renal tubular acidosis (a-like disease), acquired forms, and drug-induced dRTA. 7. The diagnosis of dRTA requires a high index of suspicion and is suggested by the following: A non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis with inappropriately low serum HCO3- concentration and/or CO2 levels, a normal or high serum anion gap, hypokalemia, hypocitraturia, and/or decreased bicarbonate reabsorption. 8. CA deficiency is the most common cause of dRTA. Genetic testing is available for the most common mutations causing CA deficiency. 9. Acetazolamide is the standard medical treatment for dRTA. 10. If medical therapy fails, renal replacement therapy may be required. 11. A low-salt diet is generally recommended for all patients with RTA. 12.

Answer: HI, thanks for using PMC-LLaMA. I can understand your concern. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver, brain and other vital organs. The accumulating copper can cause irreversible damage to your liver and brain. The only definitive treatment for Wilson's disease is liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is effective in Wilson's disease since the transplanted liver doesn't contain the mutated Wilson's disease gene. The surgery is a life-saving option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to Wilson's disease. The transplantation removes the defective gene and the failing liver. The transplanted liver begins making normal amounts of the copper-binding protein and the excess copper is eliminated from the body.  The best centers for liver transplantation are in the USA, UK and Germany. You can contact the centers to know more about the procedure and its success rate. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.",1. What is Wilson disease?2.

What are some of the treatments for Wilson disease?7. Where can I find more information about Wilson disease?,"1. Wilson disease cannot be treated completely, but with the right treatment and care, it is possible to manage the condition. 2. Wilson disease is caused by a buildup of copper in the body. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. 3. This means that two copies of the gene for Wilson disease must be missing for a person to be affected. If both parents carry one copy of this gene, there is a 25% chance of the child having Wilson disease. 4. Symptoms include problems with the brain, liver, and/or eyes. These may include tremors, speech problems, memory loss, behavior changes, confusion, muscle stiffness, and involuntary movements. 5. People with Wilson disease may also have problems with the fingers, hands, legs, and feet. Less common symptoms include problems with the bowels, kidneys, and/or lungs. 6. A diagnosis can be made by looking at the patient's medical history and symptoms, and by doing blood tests. 7. There is no cure for Wilson disease. Treatment involves medicines to reduce the amount of copper in the body and to prevent symptoms. 8. People with Wilson disease need to work with their health care provider to develop a treatment plan.",1. You should consider visiting a medical facility where you can get proper treatment for Wilson disease. 2. You can also ask for a referral to a medical institution where Wilson disease is treated. 3. You can also check online for a list of doctors who treat Wilson disease and contact them for further information. 4.

Answer: Yes, there are several new treatments being studied for systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The treatments you are taking - hydroxychloroquine, etanercept, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate - are all medications that are approved to treat scleroderma. However, none of these medications is specifically approved to treat the muscle weakness, muscle aches, and joint pains that are a part of scleroderma. There are several new treatments being studied for scleroderma, including medications that are specifically designed to reduce inflammation (such as cytokine inhibitors) and medications that affect the immune system (such as rituximab). In addition, medications that are approved to treat other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are also being studied for scleroderma. Finally, there are several new treatments being studied for scleroderma that are designed to affect the fibrosis (scarring) that occurs in scleroderma. For example, new treatments being studied include medications that affect the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis inhibitors), medications that affect the activity of certain enzymes (such as metalloproteinases) that are involved in scarring, and medications that affect the activity of certain cells that are involved in scarring (such as fibroblasts)."

She needs to be examined by an ophthalmologist, and she may need to undergo an MRI scan of the orbits to see the cause of the growth. 3. It is possible that the growth can be removed by surgery. 4. It is also possible that there is no treatment, and she may lose her remaining vision. 5. Hence, it is better to see an ophthalmologist at the earliest.","1. Your mother is suffering from age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with loss of vision in one eye and a growth over the retina in the other eye. ARMD is a degenerative condition of the retina and is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people. The condition is characterized by the degeneration of the central part of the retina (the macula) that is responsible for sharp, detailed vision.2. Since the changes are occurring in both eyes, it is essential to get a thorough ophthalmologic examination to determine the stage of the disease and the possible treatment options.3. In addition to the eye examination, your mother may have to undergo certain tests such as a dark adaptation test, Amsler grid test, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography. Based on the results of these tests, the doctor will determine whether any treatment is indicated.4. The treatment options for ARMD depend on the stage of the disease and the location of the abnormal blood vessels. No effective treatment is available for dry ARMD. For wet ARMD, laser surgery, photodynamic therapy, and intravitreal injections are the options.5.

If the cause of her vision loss is due to a problem within the eye, then there is not much else that can be done other than trying to save what is left of her vision. 5. But, if her vision loss is due to a problem within her brain, then there may be other treatments that can improve her quality of life. 6. The fact that your mother has already lost most of her vision means that she has already been treated too late.  However, there may still be some treatments that can help her.","1. I am sorry to hear about your mother's vision loss. There are a few things you can do to help her navigate daily life. First, consider getting her a service dog. These dogs are specially trained to assist blind individuals. The dogs can help with navigation, open doors, bring things to the owner, and even turn on lights. 2. There are several apps that can assist with daily living. Apps like Talking Books from the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) allows for audio book downloads. There are also apps like Be My Eyes that connects blind individuals with a sighted volunteer via live video stream for assistance with tasks like reading a menu or describing the surroundings. 3. Other technologies like the BrailleNote and the Braille Sense from Freedom Scientific allows for the blind to take notes and access information in a similar way to individuals with sight. There are also devices like the Orbit Reader 20, which scans text and reads it aloud. 4. There are many non-profit organizations that assist blind individuals. These organizations provide services like talking books, job assistance, and even free canes and other assistive devices. You can contact your local chapter of the American Council of the Blind or the National Federation of the Blind for more information. 5. Lastly, you can help your mother stay engaged and connected by encouraging her to join a support group for blind individuals or engage with her via telephone or video chat."
"1. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

"1. Scoliosis is an abnormal sideways curvature of the spine.  It can be structural (bones) or functional (no bony abnormalities, just muscle imbalances)2. Functional scoliosis is the result of muscle imbalances, one muscle group being stronger than its counterpart.  This can be due to poor posture, muscle imbalances due to injury, or muscle imbalances due to inactivity.  Inactive muscles become weak and tight, and the strong/tight muscles pull the spine out of alignment. 3. Structural scoliosis can be due to bone deformities, growth abnormalities, injury, or disease. 4. Physical therapy can treat functional scoliosis.  Treatment includes: therapeutic ultrasound, massage, stretching/strengthening exercises, and electrical stimulation.  Surgery is the only option for treating structural scoliosis. 5. Scoliosis is a dangerous disease that needs to be treated properly.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.  Good luck!","1. Non-Surgical Treatment for scoliosis includes: Physical therapy - Bracing - Exercises 2. Surgical Treatment for scoliosis includes: Spinal fusion - Rodding, sublaminar wiring.","1) Scoliosis is an abnormal, sideways curvature of the spine. Depending on the severity of the curve and the risk it poses to your health, treatment options vary. 2) For people with mild curves, the goal of treatment is to prevent the condition from getting worse. For people with more severe scoliosis, the goal of treatment is to reduce or eliminate the curve and prevent it from getting worse. 3) Treatment options include observation, bracing, surgery, and physical therapy. 4) The choice of treatment depends on the degree of the curve, the risk of it getting worse, and the person's age and general health. 5) For people with mild scoliosis, the risk of the condition getting worse is very low. The risk is higher for people with moderate and severe scoliosis. 6) For people with moderate and severe scoliosis, treatment options include bracing and surgery. Bracing is most effective for people with a small curve. The brace is designed to keep the spine from curving more. 7) Many people with scoliosis do not need surgery. However, if the spine curve is large or getting worse, surgery may be needed. Surgery can also be done to prevent the scoliosis from getting worse. 8) During surgery, the spine is realigned so the curve is reduced. Surgery can be done with a traditional open incision or using a minimally invasive technique.","1) Physical therapy exercises and stretching techniques are usually recommended as the first line of treatment for scoliosis. 2) If that doesn't work, a back brace may be prescribed to provide support for the spine and help slow the progression of the curve. 3) When the curve is severe, surgery may be necessary to correct the spine.","1) Scoliosis is an abnormal, sideways curvature of the spine. It can be due to a congenital (birth) defect in the spine.

A history of alcohol abuse does increase the risk of developing this disease.  The first symptoms people typically experience are confusion and memory problems.,"Lewy body disease (LBD) is characterized by abnormal protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, in the brain. These deposits consist of a protein called alpha-synuclein. LBD is considered a type of neurodegenerative disorder, which includes conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As with Parkinson's, LBD is associated with abnormalities in the motor system, but LBD also affects thinking, reasoning, and independent functioning.  While LBD is not yet fully understood, researchers believe it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. As with other neurodegenerative disorders, researchers believe that genetics plays a role in who develops LBD. A genetic predisposition is thought to be involved in about half of all LBD cases. However, no specific gene has been identified as being involved in LBD. Rather, researchers believe that LBD represents a spectrum of diseases with different genetic causes.  Heavy drinking is also thought to play a role in the onset of LBD, by contributing to the development of alpha-synuclein deposits. People with LBD often have features of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The initial warning signs of LBD are often very subtle. People with LBD may initially experience very mild and vague symptoms, such as trouble with sleeping, daytime drowsiness, or a slowing of daily routines. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more pronounced, and may include:  - Muscle stiffness or tightness  - Tremors similar to those in Parkinson's disease  - Mental changes, such as confusion or hallucinations  - Muscle weakness  - Slow movement  - Balance problems  - Difficulty in initiating voluntary movements  - Eye movement problems  - Difficulty in thinking and reasoning    Physical examination may reveal muscle stiffness, changes in gait or balance, and differences in the way that two different sides of the body move. A thorough physical examination and medical history, including a record of heavy drinking, can help to determine the cause of these symptoms.

Some patients may need no treatment, or only observation, if their condition is not causing symptoms or complications.  The prognosis depends on the patient's overall health, age, and stage of the cancer. In general, hairy cell leukemia is considered an indolent, or slowly progressing, cancer. With treatment, many patients can live for many years without experiencing disease symptoms.","1. Hairy cell leukemia is a rare and slow-growing cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many B cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell. These excess B cells are called hairy cells because of their unusual appearance under a microscope. 2. The average age at diagnosis is 52 years. It is four times more common in men than in women. 3. Treatment options include chemotherapy and/or biological therapy. 4. People with hairy cell leukemia usually live for an extended period.","Hairy cell leukemia is a rare type of blood cancer that affects B cells (lymphocytes). In people with this condition, too many B cells become abnormal and start to grow uncontrollably. These abnormal B cells are called ""hairy cells"" because they have tiny projections on their surface that look like hair.  The cause of hairy cell leukemia is unknown, and there is no cure. However, treatment can help control the symptoms and complications. Treatment may include chemotherapy drugs, biological therapy, and radiation therapy.  Most people with hairy cell leukemia can expect to live about 10 years after diagnosis. Treatment can help control the symptoms and complications. Treatment may include chemotherapy, biological therapy, and radiation therapy. People with this condition tend to live for a long time.","Hairy cell leukemia is a rare form of cancer that affects B cells, a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). The condition was first described in 1958 by Dr. Maurice Richter at New York's Sloan-Kettering Institute as ""leukemic reticuloendotheliosis."" It affects about 2 in every 1 million people.  Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by a distinctive pattern of cells under the microscope. These cells look ""hairy"" because of cytoplasmic projections that can be seen when the cells are stained with special dyes. The cells also show a characteristic staining pattern when viewed with a tool called an electron microscope.  The most common symptom is a painless swelling of the lymph nodes. Other symptoms include:  - Spleen enlargement  - Fever  - Weight loss  - Night sweats  - Unexplained anemia (low red blood cell count)  - Unexplained bruising or bleeding  - Recurrent infections  - Bone pain  - Early satiety (feeling full quickly when eating)  - Abdominal pain  - Dizziness  - Headache  - Vomiting  - Diarrhea  - Joint pain  - Eye pain  - Eye redness"

"1. The pancreas is an organ that sits near the upper part of the small intestine. It makes insulin. Insulin helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. In people who have diabetes, the pancreas either doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin that is made doesn't work as well as it should.2. The cells in your body need insulin to help them use the sugar from food for energy. If you have diabetes, the cells in your body don't get the energy they need. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.3. Blood glucose test - The blood glucose test is a simple test that can check your blood glucose level at any time. This test is also called the blood sugar test. To do this test, you prick your finger with a small needle. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a special test strip. The test strip is then read using a special machine. The blood glucose test gives you the result in just a few seconds.4. You probably will get this test done a few times a year. Your doctor will compare your results to what's normal for you. Your doctor will also consider your age, weight, and any other medical problems you have. Your doctor might order blood glucose tests if you have symptoms of low or high blood sugar. Your doctor also might order them if you have signs of other illnesses.5. Blood ketone test - Another blood test checks for ketones. Ketones are substances that your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy. Normally, fat breaks down for energy. But in people who have diabetes, fat breaks down for energy too often. This causes ketones to build up in the blood.6. Your doctor might ask you to do the blood ketone test if you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a serious problem that happens when you have high blood glucose and high ketones. Without treatment, DKA can lead to coma.7. Urine test - A urine test can check for ketones. It can also check for gluc","1. The pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, which is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. 2. The urinary bladder becomes heavier because urine builds up due to increased glucose levels in the blood. The glucose is drawn out of the blood into the urine by the kidneys, causing an increase in urine volume. This increased volume causes the urinary bladder to fill more quickly, becoming heavier.","1. The brain is the control center for the endocrine system. It controls the production and release of hormones that affect blood sugar levels. 2. The stomach produces hormones that control the release of food from the small intestine. If the stomach is removed, the small intestine may not be able to process food properly, leading to problems with blood sugar regulation. 3. The urine bladder is not directly involved in blood sugar regulation. However, it is a reservoir for urine, which can contain glucose. If the bladder empties too frequently, it will not have time to absorb glucose from the urine, leading to decreased blood sugar levels. This is why people with diabetes should not void frequently.","1. The pancreas produces insulin which is responsible for maintaining normal blood sugar levels. In diabetes, there is a decrease in insulin production so blood sugar levels are elevated. The body tries to compensate by increasing glucose production in the liver and decreasing glucose use by fat and muscle cells. 2. Increase in blood sugar levels leads to glycosylation of proteins in the body including the proteins in the walls of the blood vessels which leads to narrowing of the blood vessels. This leads to reduced blood flow to various organs including the brain, kidneys and the eyes. In the brain, this can lead to stroke and in the kidneys, this can lead to kidney failure. 3. Since the kidneys are responsible for maintaining normal electrolyte concentrations in the body, they will remain unaffected by insulin. However, since the insulin deficiency leads to high blood sugar levels, the glomerular filtration rate is increased leading to increased urine formation. Since the body is unable to maintain normal blood sugar levels, there is increased urine production which leads to heavier urine bladder.","1. The brain, stomach, and urine bladder do not affect blood sugar levels in diabetes patients. 2. There is no known reason why the urine bladder should gain more weight than other body parts.","1. The pancreas is the organ that produces insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. The brain has receptors for insulin and can directly influence insulin production and release. The stomach has a complex relationship with insulin. The release of gastrin from the stomach can stimulate insulin release from the pancreas. Ghrelin, produced in the stomach, can block the action of insulin. The urine bladder has a unique relationship with insulin. Insulin can stimulate the production of aquaporin channels in the bladder. These channels increase water absorption into the urine, causing the bladder to fill more quickly. This is likely a protective mechanism to reduce the risk of developing urinary tract infections. The bladder also has unique receptors for insulin. 2. The urine bladder is prone to weight gain because it is a storage organ. When insulin levels are high, the bladder can absorb more glucose from the urine, which leads to weight gain."
"1. The condition is called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) and is caused by a defect in an enzyme called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which is responsible for breaking down trimethylamine (TMA) in the liver. 2. Trimethylamine is a chemical compound with a pungent odor that smells like rotting fish, rotting eggs, or garbage, and is produced by bacteria in the gut. 3. People with TMAU either do not produce the FMO3 enzyme or produce only small amounts of it, which leads to high levels of TMA in their urine and body odor. 4. It affects both males and females, and there is no cure for the condition. 5. Gene therapy is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for TMAU.","ClinicalTrials.gov provides access to information on clinical trials for Trimethylaminuria (TMAU).

Yes, there are several ways to explore the application of gene therapy in treating TMAU, which is severely impacting my life with its persistent fish/feces odor. 2. Gene therapy is a technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. 3. The gene therapy approach for TMAU is to correct the metabolic defect in the liver, kidney, or sweat gland that results in the abnormal accumulation of trimethylamine. 4. The gene therapy approach for TMAU is still at an experimental stage. 5. Several groups have investigated the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy to correct the defect in the liver that results in trimethylamine production and the subsequent fish odor. 6. One group has also investigated the use of ultrasound to deliver the gene to the liver. 7. Another group has investigated the use of RNA interference to inhibit the expression of the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene in cell culture. 8. A final group has investigated the use of a drug to inhibit the activity of FMO3. 9. None of these approaches have been tested in humans yet. 10.

3. Genetics: Teeth grinding and clenching may have a genetic component, with some studies suggesting that first-degree relatives of people with the condition are more likely to experience it themselves.

4. Neurological factors: Neurological factors may also play a role in teeth grinding and clenching. It is possible that abnormalities in the way that the brain processes sensory information contribute to the condition.

5. Other factors: Other factors that may contribute to teeth grinding and clenching include:

- Use of alcohol or tobacco
- Certain medications
- Certain dental appliances
- Certain medical conditions

There is likely no single factor that leads to teeth grinding or clenching, but rather a combination of factors that contribute to the condition.","1. The masseter muscle is one of the strongest muscles in the body. 2. It is innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). 3. Bruxism is commonly seen in individuals who clench their teeth or grind their teeth. 4. Clenching and grinding usually occur subconsciously, and are often associated with stress, anxiety, a malocclusion (bad bite), or other factors. 5. The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3) innervates the masseter muscle. 6. The masseter muscle contracts rhythmically during bruxism, and this may be perceived as a dull, aching pain by the patient. 7. This pain may be referred to the jaw, the temple, the ear, or the side of the head. 8. Bruxism is commonly seen in individuals who clench their teeth or grind their teeth. 9.

This pain may be referred to the jaw, the temple, the ear, or the side of the head.",1. Bruxism usually manifests in the jaw because stress causes contraction of masseter and temporalis muscles due to the following reasons:a. These muscles are in constant state of activity even at rest.b. These muscles are attached to mandible which is a freely movable bone.c. Mandible moves with even slightest emotional changes.2. Other muscles groups like the arms and legs are not influenced by stress or anxiety becausea. These muscles are not attached to any freely movable bones.b. Even if they are attached to bones they do not move with slightest emotional changes.,"1) Jaw muscles are larger and stronger than other muscles of the body and can exert considerable force on the teeth. 2) The jaw is positioned forward from the rest of the skull, which allows for considerable movement and generates considerable force on the teeth."
"1. You have mentioned that you have been suffering from Social Anxiety from childhood. You did not mention anything about treatment you received for the same. Were you ever put on medications? If yes, what was the duration of treatment and what was the medication given?2. I presume you were given antianxiety medication. If you were my patient, I would have put you on Buspirone. It is a good non-habit forming anxiolytic and is also effective in chronic anxiety disorders.3. It is good that you have been practicing Meditation, Mindfulness and CBT. Please continue with these techniques. These are proven to be very effective in Chronic Anxiety Disorders.4. Your Psychiatrist has prescribed you medication to help with sleep. If I were your treating doctor, I would have put you on Mizoram (which is a non-addictive medication). As you are already on Buspirone, I would not suggest you to take Mizoram along with Buspirone. Please consult your treating doctor about the same.5. For your insomnia, you can try the following things:a. Try to maintain a proper sleep hygiene.b. Practice PMC-LLaMA. c. Do not watch TV or use your laptop or mobile in bed.d. Do not take any caffeine after 6pm.e. Do not exercise vigorously just before bedtime.f. Try to reduce your stress by practicing Meditation and Mindfulness.g. If you still do not get any relief, you can take medication like Mizoram 0.5 mg.

Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the general population. 2. Insomnia can be either acute or chronic. Acute insomnia is usually triggered by a stressful event or situation, such as a major life change, a traumatic event, or a medical illness. Chronic insomnia, on the other hand, may have an underlying cause, such as depression, anxiety, or a medical disorder. Treating the underlying cause may improve the insomnia. 3. Chronic insomnia may also be related to poor sleep habits and behaviors. 4. Most people with insomnia do not seek medical help, but instead try to deal with the problem themselves by changing their daily schedule or activities (such as working fewer hours, exercising more, or consuming more caffeine), napping, or resorting to alcohol or sedatives. 5. Sedatives and sleeping pills should only be used as a last resort for insomnia because of their addictive potential. 6. Research suggests that CBT is an effective treatment for insomnia.","1. Chronic insomnia is often caused by an underlying psychiatric disorder such as depression or anxiety. It can also be caused by a medical condition or substance abuse.2. It's important to identify the cause of your insomnia so that the appropriate treatment can be initiated.

"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. This is called asymmetric hypertrophy. 2. The heart is divided into 4 chambers. The 2 bottom chambers are called ventricles. The 2 upper chambers are called atria. HCM most often occurs in the ventricles. 3. The thickened area can be “fixed,” meaning that it will not move during the cardiac cycle, or “dynamic,” meaning that it moves with the cardiac cycle. 4. Most people with HCM have no symptoms and may never develop symptoms. Some people with HCM may experience shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. 5. The most serious complication of HCM is sudden cardiac death due to a fatal heart rhythm disturbance. Sudden cardiac death is usually caused by a fatal heart rhythm disturbance called ventricular fibrillation. 6. To diagnose HCM, a doctor will use a medical history, physical examination, and test results. The most common test used to diagnose HCM is an echocardiogram. 7. The goals of HCM treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Medications are often used to treat symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. Beta-blockers are often used to slow down the heart rate and improve blood flow. People with HCM should avoid strenuous exercise and competitive athletics. 8. Some people with HCM may need a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden death. Surgery is rarely needed for HCM. 9. HCM cannot be cured, but medications and implantable devices can help control symptoms and prevent complications. People with HCM usually live normal lives. 10. The most common inherited heart condition is aortic valve disease, followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). 11. The most common congenital heart defects are atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus. 12","1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This problem may run in families. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or fainting. HCM is the most common cause of sudden death in young athletes. 2) Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. This problem may also run in families. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles.","1) Heart conditions are of two types - congenital (present from birth) and acquired (develop over time). 2) Congenital conditions are due to defect in development of heart during fetal life and can be diagnosed by ultrasound scans and other tests during pregnancy. 3) Acquired conditions are due to lifestyle, environment, infections etc. and may present later in life. 4) These can be diagnosed by clinical examination and investigations like ECG, Echocardiography, TMT, stress echo etc. 5) In case of acquired conditions, cause has to be treated first and then the symptoms. 6) In case of congenital conditions, no treatment may be required if mild, and surgical correction may be required in severe cases.","1) Heart conditions: There are many types of heart conditions, some of which are congenital (present from birth). When the heart is working properly, it pumps blood throughout the body. When there is a problem with the way the heart is functioning, it can affect the body's ability to receive and distribute blood and other nutrients. 2) Heart disease in children: Heart disease is uncommon in children, but can be a serious problem when it does occur. Some congenital heart problems can lead to heart disease in children. Heart disease in children may also occur from problems with the heart that were present at birth, and may gradually get worse as the child grows. Some examples of heart disease in children include: congenital heart defects, Kawasaki disease, acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, valve disease, cardiomyopathy, heart block, endocarditis, and heart tumors. 3) Treatment: The treatment of heart disease in children depends on the cause and severity of the condition. It may include medication, surgery, or other procedures. The goal of treatment is to help the child's heart work as well as possible, and to prevent or manage complications.","1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic heart condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). As a result, the heart muscle has difficulty relaxing and filling with blood. Symptoms include chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, fainting, and shortness of breath. 2) Long QT Syndrome: Long QT syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the electrical functions of the heart. It is caused by defects in genes that regulate heartbeats. People with long QT syndrome have an increased risk of sudden death from an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Symptoms may include dizziness or fainting after a sudden move or change in posture, or while running or exercising.","1. Congenital heart disease: A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart that is present at birth. In most cases, the cause of congenital heart disease is not known. The heart is a complex organ with four valves and several chambers. It is also made up of various muscles and connections that allow the blood to flow through the heart and out to the body. A congenital heart defect is present if the heart does not function properly because of a problem with the structure of the heart. 2. Cardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem. There are three types of cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Restrictive cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy means the heart muscle becomes weak and enlarged. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy means the heart muscle becomes thick. Restrictive cardiomyopathy means the heart muscle becomes stiff."

"Williams Syndrome (also known as Williams-Beuren Syndrome or WS) is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 7, which is inherited from one parent. The parents of a child with WS usually have no symptoms of the condition.  People with Williams Syndrome have unique personalities and abilities. They are friendly, outgoing, and tend to smile frequently. Many people with WS have a remarkable ability to learn music. They may also have trouble understanding concepts like time or money. People with WS often have star-like skin markings, a broad forehead, puffiness around the eyes, a short, upturned nose, and a small mouth. They may have dental problems like teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. Children with WS often have feeding problems as babies and young toddlers. As teenagers and adults, people with WS are likely to have trouble with their blood sugar levels and to be overweight.  Many children with WS have medical problems. The most common problem is a heart defect that needs to be treated with medicine or surgery. Children with WS can also have problems with their blood vessels, kidneys, and liver. They are more likely to get infections, especially of the ears and throat. Girls with WS often have irregular menstrual cycles and are unable to get pregnant.  Williams Syndrome is usually not inherited. If a child has WS, the parents do not have it. The condition happens when a person gets an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 7. The extra genetic material usually comes from the mother.  There is no medication or treatment to cure Williams Syndrome. Treatment is based on the symptoms a person has. For example, glasses or contact lenses may be used to correct vision problems. A device that makes sounds when activated by a switch may help a person with hearing problems. There is no cure for the mental retardation or unusual personality of Williams Syndrome.  People with Williams Syndrome should have regular checkups with a doctor. The doctor will check for health problems that are more common in people with WS. Regular checkups can help find medical problems","Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by a deletion of about 26 genes on chromosome 7. Individuals with Williams Syndrome have distinctive facial features, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and heart and blood vessel (vascular) problems.  Individuals with Williams Syndrome may also have other health problems such as diabetes, inflammation of the joints (arthritis), and digestive system problems.  Individuals with Williams Syndrome are very interested in social interactions and tend to be very friendly and outgoing. They are also very curious about the world around them. However, they can also be impulsive, anxious, and easily distracted.  Children with Williams Syndrome often have delayed speech and language development. They may also have problems with attention and memory. As adults, many individuals with Williams Syndrome have trouble holding a job.  Williams Syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens as a result of a chance event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell. Parents should not assume that their child's condition was inherited. It is important to remember that even though a condition is not inherited, genetic counseling may still be helpful. This is because there is a 1 in 2,500 chance of having another child with Williams Syndrome.",Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It can cause problems with learning and development. Williams Syndrome is caused by a problem with a gene in the person's DNA.  People with Williams Syndrome may have these problems:  - Delayed development  - Learning disabilities  - Mental retardation  - Short stature  - Unusual facial features  - Unusual behavior  - Problems with hearing and vision  - Problems with the heart and blood vessels Doctors diagnose Williams Syndrome based on the person's symptoms and medical history. There is no cure for Williams Syndrome. Treatment is aimed at the person's symptoms. People with Williams Syndrome should get regular checkups with a health care provider.,"1) Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of a small piece of the long arm of chromosome 7 missing. The missing piece is what we call a microdeletion. 2) Williams Syndrome affects many parts of the body. It affects how the brain develops. It can cause problems with how the heart and kidneys work. It can cause problems with how the blood vessels develop. It can affect how bones grow and how muscles work. 3) Williams Syndrome is also associated with a personality that is very friendly and trusting. People with Williams Syndrome are also very interested in other people. They may not understand when others do not return their friendliness. 4) People with Williams Syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability. They usually have IQs in the 50 to 65 range. Some people only do testing in one area and may not find all of the problems. 5) If you think your child may have Williams Syndrome, you should contact a geneticist. The geneticist will test the child and the parents. Testing both parents helps to tell whether the child got the gene from one parent or both parents. 6) Williams Syndrome is treated by finding the problems early and treating them. Early treatment of heart and kidney problems can help avoid more serious problems later. Good support can also help people with Williams Syndrome.","Williams Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. It can cause problems with learning, hearing, your heart and circulatory system, and your digestive system.  Williams Syndrome is caused by a problem with a gene in the person's chromosome. It is passed down through families (inherited).  Williams Syndrome affects males and females equally. It can occur in any racial or ethnic group. About 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 10,000 people have Williams Syndrome. It is most common in Caucasian people.  Early treatment and a high level of care can help children with Williams Syndrome reach their full potential. Children should get regular checkups with a doctor who specializes in genetics.  People with Williams Syndrome grow up to be independent and able to hold jobs and form relationships.

People with WS usually have mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems. They also may have unique personality traits and distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, short nose, wide mouth, full cheeks, and a small chin. Other features include a curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and stiff joints. Some people with WS have heart and blood vessel (vascular) problems. Often, these problems are not serious. However, some people with WS have serious heart and blood vessel problems. Infants with WS often have feeding problems and slow growth. They may have trouble gaining weight, developing, or having bowel movements at a normal time. Some females with WS have genitalia that is not fully developed.

"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease which results from destruction of myelin in the central nervous system.  Currently there are several medications that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  These medications include four different forms of interferon, glatiramer acetate, and two different forms of beta interferon.  In addition, there are currently several clinical trials going on for new medications to treat multiple sclerosis.  However, at this time there is no cure for multiple sclerosis.  The goal of treatment is to stop or slow down the progression of the disease.  Unfortunately, no medication has been shown to be able to repair the damage that has already been done.  In addition, no medication has been shown to be able to cure the disease.  The goal of research is to continue to find new medications that will be able to slow down or stop the progression of multiple sclerosis.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict when a cure will be found.  It could be as early as next year or it could be 20 years from now.  The hope is that a cure will be found in the near future.","Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by a triad of inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis (scarring); the course can be relapsing-remitting or progressive. The clinical manifestations of MS are diverse and can involve almost any neurologic function, including sensation, strength, coordination, and the ability to move and think.  The goals of treatment are to prevent relapses, to prevent disability, and to improve the patient's quality of life. Because no treatment is curative, the cornerstone of long-term management is patient education regarding the disease process, treatment options, and the importance of adherence to prescribed therapy. Therapeutic agents for MS are classified as IFN-beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, and natalizumab.  Treatment with the beta interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide is usually administered by subcutaneous injection on a regular basis, and treatment with natalizumab is administered by intravenous infusion on a regular basis.  A cure for MS is not yet available.  However, progress is being made in the development of new medications.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerves in the central nervous system.  The exact cause of MS is unknown. However, it is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks the central nervous system.  There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms.  Some drugs can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, or attacks, in people with relapsing-remitting MS.  Other drugs can help reduce the progression of disability if taken continuously for several years.  Most people with MS can live active lives with proper treatment, symptom management, and healthy lifestyle choices.  More than 100,000 people in the United States are affected by MS. The disorder is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with two times more women than men being affected.  No one knows what triggers the initial attack, why some people go on to develop MS, and why others do not.  However, there are several known risk factors:  Having a family member with MS Increased age Male sex MS symptoms may appear in varying patterns.  Usually, they come and go with no set pattern.  The diagnosis of MS may be made when an individual has had attacks with signs and symptoms characteristic of the disease.  In other cases, the diagnosis may be made when a person has an attack that is characteristic of MS, and at some later point, the person has another attack that leads to the diagnosis.  In still other cases, the diagnosis may be made after a person has shown symptoms characteristic of MS for at least 30 days, along with signs of damage to the central nervous system.  The following tests may be performed to help diagnose MS:  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (lumbar puncture) Evoked potential tests (visual, hearing, or electrical)  Tests of depression or cognitive dysfunction","Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the destruction of myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers, which can cause a variety of symptoms. This destruction is caused by an autoimmune response, in which the body's immune system begins to treat myelin protein as an invader and destroys it.  There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, although new medications are being introduced that seem to have promise.  The disease is progressive, and although there are periods of remission, the disease tends to worsen over time.  It is not yet possible to reverse the damage already done to the myelin sheath, although attempts are being made to develop stem cell research to try to replace damaged cells.  The best hope at this point is to prevent the disease or stop it at an early stage, and this is where research is being focused.","Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the body's immune system attacking the protective covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds the nerves. The damage to the myelin sheath interrupts the flow of information within the brain and spinal cord.  The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. However, researchers think that multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's immune system attacks its own tissues.  Several factors may trigger the disease, including:  - Infection  - Trauma to the central nervous system  - Genetic factors  - Environmental factors, such as where one lives or dies  - Other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis  - Virus infection  - Vaccination  - Pregnancy  - Oral contraceptive use  - Silicone breast implants  - Physical trauma  - Psychological stress  - Epilepsy   There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several medications and other treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent or lessen some problems.  People with multiple sclerosis often can benefit from working with a team of health care professionals that may include a neurologist, urologist, physical therapist, and social worker.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss.  The most common course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity (remission). The other type is progressive subtype, which is characterized by a steady functional decline from disease onset. The clinical manifestations of MS result from the involvement of the nervous system at different levels. Weakness in the extremities results from involvement of motor pathways in the brain and spinal cord. Sensory loss results from involvement of the posterior column, spinothalamic tract, and medial lemniscus. Optic nerve involvement produces visual disturbances, and bladder and bowel dysfunction results from involvement of the descending autonomic tracts. The diagnosis of MS is based on the patient's history, neurologic examination findings, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord. MRI is sensitive to lesions in the white matter, which are often diagnostic of MS when found in typical locations.  There currently is no cure for MS.  Several medications have been approved for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Most of these medications are given by injection either monthly or every other month. Medications are available to treat acute attacks and symptoms of MS. Several medications are available to treat the symptoms of bladder dysfunction, spasticity, and pain. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, and cognitive retraining are also important parts of the overall management of MS. Most patients with MS do not walk at 20 years after disease onset. In general, patients with MS have a normal life expectancy, although they may be at increased risk for suicide."

Introduction: Risperidone is an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is taken by mouth and is available as tablets and oral solutions.2. Mechanism of Action: The exact mechanism by which risperidone produces its therapeutic effects is not fully understood. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that exerts its actions by antagonism at multiple neurotransmitter receptors. It acts as a partial agonist at the dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D2) receptor and as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and the a-adrenergic receptor.3. Pharmacokinetics: Risperidone is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 1-3 hours. Risperidone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 to 9-hydroxyrisperidone and 3-hydroxy risperidone, respectively. These metabolites are inactive.4. Adverse Effects: The most common side effects associated with risperidone are insomnia, headache, anxiety, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. Extrapyramidal symptoms, including tardive dyskinesia, may also occur with risperidone use. Risperidone may increase the risk of stroke in individuals with brain disorders. Risperidone may also increase the risk of death in individuals with dementia-related psychosis.5. Drug Interactions: Combined use with fluoxetine may increase the risk of central serotonin syndrome. Combined use with carbamazepine may decrease the concentration and effects of risperidone. Combined use with propylthiouracil may increase the concentration and effects of risperidone.

"Dear, We understand your concerns went through your details. Lupus is an autoimmune disease, and it is an inflammatory disease. You must know that body immune system protects the body against external agents which are harmful for the body. Body produces antibodies to fight against them. But in autoimmune disease, the body produces antibodies against the body itself. The reasons for the development of lupus are not known. Researchers think that lupus may be caused by a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors. The treatment of lupus is contingent on the symptoms and the type of lupus. For example, the symptoms of cutaneous lupus may be treated with antibiotics to treat infection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and swelling, and topical steroids for skin involvement. These treatments are also appropriate for the treatment of nephritis. In severe conditions, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antimalarials are used. You may consult your physician for a detailed diagnosis and treatment plan. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute detail possible. Hope this answers your query.  Further clarifications are welcome. Good luck. Take care.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. It is often difficult to diagnose and may require several diagnostic tests.

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia. AML typically develops in older adults and involves the myeloid type of white blood cells. CML typically develops in adults younger than 40 years and involves the lymphoid type of white blood cells.","Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood that results from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells.  The cause of most leukemias is not known. However, leukemia may result from exposure to radiation and certain chemicals, such as benzene. Smoking and exposure to benzene increase the risk of developing AML.  Some types of leukemia tend to run in families and may be associated with abnormal chromosomes.  The body has a greater capacity to tolerate chemotherapy in young children than in older adults, so treatment for children may be more successful.  People can recover from leukemia. However, the prognosis varies with the type and extent of the disease.  Leukemia impacts bodily functions by interfering with the production of normal blood cells.  Leukemia is not passed down through genes.  Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread throughout the body, usually involving critical organs such as the bone marrow, liver, and spleen.  The prognosis for people with leukemia varies. The average survival rate for people with CLL is approximately 10 years after diagnosis. With treatment, the 5-year survival rate for people with ALL is 85 percent, and for people with AML, 55 percent.  In some cases, leukemia can be seen on X-rays.  The necessary steps in treating leukemia include determining the type of leukemia, assessing the patient's general health, and staging the disease. People with leukemia may need to take medications, including chemotherapy, antibiotics, and blood transfusions.  The earliest signs of leukemia are fatigue, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding.  Treatment for leukemia usually includes chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation, and/or immunotherapy.","1. Several factors can contribute to the onset of leukemia cancer, including genetic abnormalities, exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals, and infections. 2. With proper treatment and care, people with leukemia can often achieve remission, meaning the cancer is under control. However, because there is no cure for most types of leukemia, the disease may recur (come back). 3. The systems that are most likely to be affected by leukemia are the blood and lymph nodes. The disease can interfere with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. Leukemia can also weaken the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections. 4. Leukemia is not an inherited trait. In most cases, there is no known way to prevent the disease. 5. In some cases, leukemia can be cured. However, most people with leukemia experience recurrences (relapses). In these cases, the disease may be difficult to treat, and the outlook is often poor. 6. The average life span for people with leukemia varies depending on the type and extent of the disease. 7. It is possible to identify leukemia before symptoms begin, through special tests. However, many people with the disease do not have symptoms until the cancer has affected their health. 8. The required treatments for leukemia depend on the type and extent of the disease. In most cases, the treatments include chemotherapy, biological therapy, and radiation therapy. 9. Common indicators of leukemia include fatigue, weakness, and frequent infections. Other symptoms may include bleeding or bruising, fever, and weight loss. 10. The two main types of leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have some similarities and some differences. Both types interfere with the ability of the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells. However, the progression and treatment of each type of leukemia is different."
"1. Lupus is a disease that can affect many different body parts and cause many different symptoms. It can affect your skin, joints, heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, and other parts of the body. 2.

"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves progressive weakness of the muscles. It is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most severe form of muscular dystrophy.  People with this condition have muscle weakness that quickly gets worse. They have difficulty walking, jumping, and running. The shoulder muscles are often the first to be affected. The pelvic and leg muscles follow, making it hard for children to keep up with their peers.  About 1 in 5000 boys in the United States are born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The disease is much more common in males than females. The disease is caused by an X-linked recessive gene. This means that the defective gene that causes the disease is located on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome, so they will have the disease if they inherit the defective gene. In females, the defective gene is on one of the two X chromosomes. Females who have one defective gene are said to be carriers. They usually do not have the disease.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is usually diagnosed before age 6. Most boys reach their full growth potential by age 10. The heart and respiratory muscles are affected by age 18. The disease is usually fatal by age 25.",Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder. It follows an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance and mainly affects males.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves progressive muscle weakness. It is the most common childhood-onset muscular dystrophy and one of the most common genetic disorders affecting all races and ethnic groups. The disease is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact.  A boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is usually born appearing normal. The first signs of the disease--such as difficulty walking, frequent falls, and toe walking--usually appear during the preschool years. In most boys, the disease progresses so that by adolescence they cannot stand or walk.   Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects the muscles that move the limbs (the arms and legs), the muscles used for breathing, and the heart. The disease slowly affects the muscles used for the bladder and bowel emptying.  The most severe symptom of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a weakening of the heart and respiratory muscles. Complications of Duchenne muscular dystrophy include cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart), scoliosis (a severe curvature of the spine), and malignant hypehermia (a potentially fatal reaction to certain medications used for general anesthesia).  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is diagnosed by a combination of the family history, a physical exam, and laboratory tests. The family history may show that many male relatives on the mother's or father's side of the family had the disease. The physical exam shows a characteristic ""waddling"" gait and the inability to rise from the floor without help. The muscle in the lower leg is usually too weak to lift the foot uphill, causing the child to toewalk.  Laboratory tests include a muscle biopsy, genetic tests, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). A muscle biopsy can sometimes confirm the diagnosis, but genetic testing is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is managed by a team of health care providers, including a neurologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, physical therapist, and orthopedist. Physical therapy is an impoant","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder passed down through families (genetic). It is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The disease occurs almost exclusively in boys. Onset is between ages 3 and 5. The disease gets progressively worse until it causes death, usually by the third decade of life. The heart and respiratory muscles may also be affected. Treatment includes physical therapy to keep muscles working, medicines to lessen inflammation, and steroids to lessen muscle weakness.","Yes, you should contact the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) at (800) 577-4777 or visit their website at http://www.mdausa.org/ for information on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Acupuncture. 11. Alternative Medicine. 12. Lifestyle Changes.","1. Herniated discs are treated with a variety of approaches, including medication, physical therapy, rest, and surgery. Surgery is generally recommended only after a trial of non-surgical therapy has not relieved painful symptoms. 2. Because it is unclear whether you will benefit from surgery, it is important to discuss the benefits and risks of surgery with your doctor before making a decision. 3. Your doctor may recommend a type of procedure called a microdiscectomy. In this surgery, your surgeon will remove part of the disc that is pressing on the nerve. 4. Prior to surgery, your doctor will likely order imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan, to help identify the source of your pain and the extent of the herniated disc. 5. During surgery, your surgeon will make an incision in your lower back. Then, your surgeon will use a surgical microscope to see into the small opening in your spine and remove the portion of the disc that is pressing on your nerve. 6. After surgery, you will be sent to a recovery room and possibly to an inpatient rehabilitation unit to begin physical therapy. You will likely go home the next day. 7. You will need to avoid lifting heavy objects and twisting or bending for several weeks after surgery. It will probably take 6 weeks to 3 months to fully recover.","1. Yes, there are other options for treating a herniated disc besides surgery. 2. Non-surgical treatments are usually tried first, unless there is evidence of nerve damage or loss of function. 3. Non-surgical treatments include rest, physical therapy, pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and/or steroid injections. 4. If these options are not successful, surgery may be considered. 5. Surgery involves removing the part of the disc that is putting pressure on a nerve. 6. The part of the disc that is removed is called a herniated disc fragment. 7. Surgery can usually be done on an outpatient basis, and recovery is usually quick. 8. Risks of the surgery include infection, bleeding, and complications from anesthesia. 9. Complications from the surgery itself are generally rare.","1) First, you need to see a spine specialist (orthopedic surgeon, neurologist, or neurosurgeon) to confirm that you do indeed have a herniated disc. 2) If the disc is confirmed, he or she will then determine if you are a candidate for surgery. 3) Factors that play a role in determining whether you will benefit from surgery include the severity of your pain, how much it hurts, and how it affects your daily life. 4) If you are a candidate for surgery, your doctor will describe the risks and benefits of the procedure. 5) If surgery is not recommended, your doctor may suggest other treatments, such as physical therapy, medications, or steroid injections."

However, because Turner syndrome occurs due to an abnormal number of chromosomes, it is possible for a child to have Turner syndrome but have a normal karyotype (chromosome analysis).  In addition, because Turner syndrome can affect fertility, it is possible for a woman with Turner syndrome to have a child with a different biological father.  If your daughter's children do not have Turner syndrome, it is likely due to the fact that their biological father did not have the abnormal chromosome.","Yes, it's possible for your daughter to have babies with a normal genetic makeup.  Turners syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that occurs when only one X chromosome is present in each cell of a female's body instead of the usual two.  The severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person.  People with Turner's syndrome often have a heart defect, diabetes, and ovarian failure.  It's also common for them to be infertile.  Your daughter may have developed ovarian tissue, but she probably lacks ovaries and has no ovarian function.  This means that she can't produce eggs, which would be necessary for her to have biological children.  However, she may be able to carry a pregnancy if she receives donated eggs and has them implanted in her uterus.  The pregnancy would be a high-risk pregnancy, and your grandchildren would have a genetic makeup of the donor, not your daughter.

You should talk to your doctor about treatment options. Depending on the cause of the erectile dysfunction, your doctor may recommend:

a. Medicine. Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra) are medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These medicines are taken by mouth before sexual activity.

They work by increasing blood flow to the penis in response to sexual stimulation. This helps to produce an erection.

Sildenafil, vardenafil, and avanafil should not be taken by people who take nitroglycerin (a heart medicine).

Tadalafil is also used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs).

2. Other medicines, such as alprostadil (Muse, in the pellet), papaverine, and phentolamine (Regard, in the injecorm), can also be used to produce an erection. But these medicines are used less often because they require injection into the penis or urethra.

3. Pelvic exercise, called pelvic floor exercises, can also be helpful. During these exercises, you squeeze and release the muscles in the pelvic area. You can do these exercises on your own or with the help of a physical therapist.

4. Other treatments include vacuum constriction devices or penile prostheses. These are devices that may be surgically implanted into the penis to cause an erection. They are used when medicines are not effective.

5. Surgery may be used to correct problems such as scarring or blockages in the penis.

If there is no sperm in the semen because of a blockage in the passageways (ducts) that carry the sperm, surgery may be needed to repair the blockage. If no sperm can be found in the testicles, biopsies may be done to try to find sperm in the ducts. If no sperm can be found there, artificial insemination using sperm from a donor may be considered. If infertility is due to a problem with the testicles or the production of sperm, hormones can be used to stimulate testosterone production. If no sperm are found in the semen after hormone treatment, artificial insemination may be considered. 2) If azoospermia is due to an infection or inflammation of the prostate or other parts of the male reproductive tract, antibiotics may be prescribed.","1.

This means that 61 out of 100 patients are alive after 10 years of being diagnosed with colon cancer. Relapse can occur even after 10 years. Life expectancy depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis.,"After cancer treatment is over, it is possible for cancer to come back in the same person (relapse).  Cancer that returns is called a recurrence.  It may be in the same area as the original tumor, or it may be in another part of the body.  Sometimes cancer returns in the form of leukemia or lymphoma (cancers of the blood or lymph nodes).  A recurrence may be found during a routine physical exam or CAT scan.  Sometimes it is found because the person becomes sick or has new symptoms.  A recurrence can be treated, and many people are cured with treatment.  The length of survival after cancer recurrence depends on many things, including the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer when the person was first diagnosed, the treatment that was used, and the person's general health.  People who have a recurrence in the first 2 years after treatment usually have a poor prognosis. People who have a recurrence many years after treatment have a better prognosis.  Some people may live for many years after a recurrence. Others may have recurrences that cannot be controlled, and they may die within a short time.","1. Cancer can recur after treatment has ended.

Other cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, are much more difficult to cure. 3) The outlook for people with cancer depends on many factors. These include the type and stage of the cancer, the extent to which it has spread, and the aggressiveness of the cancer. 4) A person who has been treated for cancer should be examined and have imaging tests to see whether the cancer has returned or whether there are signs of a new cancer. 5) Survival rates for certain types of cancer are based on the stage of the cancer. The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after their cancer is found. 6) Most people who are diagnosed with cancer will survive at least 5 years. In many cases, people return to an active life after treatment."

HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system, making it hard for the body to fight off infections and some diseases. As a result, people with HIV/AIDS often have many different kinds of infections. 2. HIV/AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV can be transmitted through: Unprotected sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) Sharing needles or other injection drug equipment Sharing toothbrushes or razors with an infected person Receiving infected blood 3. When HIV infects a cell, it becomes a proviral DNA copy of the original HIV virus in the infected cell. The proviral DNA can remain dormant in the infected cell for years before it begins to kill the cell. 4. In the United States, more than 1.1 million people are infected with HIV, but nearly 25% of them don't know they have the disease. 5. The current standard of care for HIV/AIDS is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which uses a combination of at least three drugs to fight the virus. 6. A healthy immune system can control HIV, keeping the virus at a low level in the blood (known as viral suppression). But if the immune system becomes weakened, HIV can multiply in the blood unchecked and the amount of virus in the blood (viral load) will increase. 7. If diagnosed early, HIV can be managed with medications that keep the virus at bay. But HIV can develop into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is the final stage of the disease. 8. People with HIV/AIDS may have a range of symptoms, including: Skin rashes Fever Night sweats Fatigue Weight loss Swollen lymph nodes Diarrhea 9. The goal of HIV treatment is to control the virus, which helps to prevent AIDS and decrease the risk of transmitting the virus to others. 10. There is currently no cure for HIV/AIDS, but researchers are working on new therapies and vaccines. 11. People","1. HIV/AIDS treatment aims to control the virus and improve the immune system to prevent further damage to the body. 2. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard treatment for HIV/AIDS. It involves taking a combination of medications to suppress the virus. 3. The first-line therapy for HIV/AIDS includes two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), one protease inhibitor (PI), and a low dose of ritonavir (to boost the effect of the PI). 4. The second-line therapy includes two NRTIs and one NNRTI. 5. The third-line therapy includes two NRTIs alone. 6. The most advanced treatment, called ""treatment-experienced"" therapy, includes people who have taken three or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. 7. There are also several factors to consider when selecting an HIV/AIDS treatment plan, including medication side effects, age, and pre-existing conditions. 8.

"1. Lupus is a disease that can affect the whole body. Lupus can affect different organ systems and can have different symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms of lupus include joint pain, swelling in the joints, skin rashes, hair loss, feeling tired, and feeling sick.2. Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means your body's immune system attacks healthy cells and tissue by mistake. This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There is no known cause of lupus, but scientists think it may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and hormonal factors.3. Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are joint pain or swelling, fever, chest pain, hair loss, skin rashes, feeling tired, and feeling sick. You could have lupus if you have 2 or more of these symptoms that last 6 months or longer, and if none of these symptoms can be explained by any other condition.4. Lupus is often difficult to diagnose. There is no one test or sign that can make or exclude a diagnosis of lupus. Instead, your doctor has to use a number of tests to help make the diagnosis.5. There is no cure for lupus, but medications can help control symptoms. People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will probably see a rheumatologist, who specializes in lupus and other rheumatic diseases. You may also need to see other doctors, such as a dermatologist (skin specialist), ophthalmologist (eye specialist), or nephrologist (kidney specialist).6. Treatment for lupus depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Some people with lupus only have mild symptoms. They may only need pain relievers and sunscreen to protect their skin from the sun. Others may need medications to help control their symptoms. Steroids are one type of medication that is often used.7. You may need to take steroids to help control your symptoms. Steroids are strong anti-inflammatory medications that help reduce swelling and pain. They work by changing the way your immune system works","Lupus is an autoimmune disease, meaning that your body's immune system attacks healthy tissue. There are many kinds of lupus, but the most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affects many parts of the body.  Lupus can be mild, with symptoms that come and go. It can also be serious, causing swelling and pain in joints, skin rashes, hair loss, mouth ulcers, and sensitivity to the sun. It can affect organs such as the kidneys and heart.  The cause of lupus is not known. Lupus is most often diagnosed in women during childbearing years. It is more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women than in Caucasian women. There is also a higher risk among people with family members who have lupus.  Lupus is usually a chronic disease, meaning that it needs to be monitored for a long time. There is no cure, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it.","1. Lupus is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that can affect any organ system in the body. It most commonly affects the skin, joints, lungs, heart, and kidneys. 2. Lupus is often referred to as ""the great imitator"" because its symptoms are so varied and can be mistaken for those of so many other diseases. Lupus is typically characterized by periods of illness (flares) followed by periods of remission when there are no signs or symptoms of the disease. 3. The cause of lupus is not known. However, scientists believe that lupus occurs when a person's immune system becomes stressed and begins to attack the body's own tissues. The resulting inflammation then causes pain, swelling, and loss of function in affected parts of the body. 4. Anyone can develop lupus, but it is most common in women between the ages of 15 and 45. Women are 10 times more likely than men to develop lupus. Women who develop lupus before they reach menopause may have more severe disease than those who develop lupus later in life. 5. There is no one test for diagnosing lupus. Instead, doctors use a combination of methods to determine if the person's symptoms are caused by lupus. These methods include a physical exam, blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies. The doctor also may perform a biopsy and measure ANTIOCH LEVELS. 6. Lupus is typically treated with medications that control inflammation, suppress the immune system, and/or match the symptoms of the disease. These medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressant drugs. 7.

"1.2 x 2.3 mm kidney stone can be treated by medical dissolution therapy, surgical management or lithography. Medical dissolution therapy includes potassium citrate syrup or sodium bicarbonate with sodium citrate. This medication increases the urinary pH and thereby causes the stone to dissolve. This method is slow and takes 4-6 weeks to dissolve the stones. Surgical management includes PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy). In this procedure, a track is created in the kidney and a hollow tube is inserted into the kidney. The stones are broken into small pieces and removed using a suction cannula. Lithotripsy is a procedure where a stone is broken into small pieces by shock waves. This requires hospitalization. The fragments are then flushed out in the urine. Hope this answers your query.

"1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder. Its etiology is unknown. 2. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. 3. PTSD is often accompanied by disturbances in the management of fear and anxiety. Symptoms may include shakiness, sweating, heart rate and blood pressure instability, irritability, and poor concentration. 4. Although the two disorders have different etiology, there are a lot of overlapping symptoms. For example, both IBS and PTSD patients may experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, bloating, and other non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. 5. A lot of studies have found that patients with IBS frequently have psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety and depression. However, only a few studies have found that IBS patients have higher prevalence of PTSD compared to general population. 6. The most recent study found that the prevalence of PTSD was 10% in IBS patients, which is significantly higher than general population. 7. A possible explanation of IBS and PTSD co-occurrence is shared brain mechanisms of limbic system and hypothalamus. Another possible explanation is that the common psychosocial factors may influence the development of both disorders. 8. The main message is that IBS patients should be screened for PTSD. If PTSD is found, appropriate treatment should be offered to the patient.","1.

This is a retrospective study using a validated questionnaire, which was compiled from the literature and sent to 250 patients with IBS in one gastroenterology unit in the Netherlands. 6. The questionnaire addressed demographic and clinical characteristics, co-morbidity, gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and co-morbid psychiatric disorders. 7. A total of 145 patients (58%) returned the questionnaire. Of the 145 patients, 39 (27%) reported a history of PTSD, which is significantly higher than the reported prevalence of PTSD in the general population (Odds ratio = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4-3.7). 8. This study shows a significantly higher prevalence of PTSD in patients with IBS compared with the general population. 9. This is a retrospective study with a response rate of 58%.

Answer: yes","1.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. 2.  People with PTSD may experience negative, distressing thoughts and feelings. They may also experience certain physical symptoms, such as sweating and tachycardia (a fast heart rate). 3.  People with PTSD are at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm. 4.  PTSD often develops within 6 months of the trauma, but can occur at any time. 5.  Symptoms of PTSD may last for many years, though typically (and ideally) a person can get help to manage and/or overcome their symptoms. 6.  People with PTSD are at a higher risk for other mental disorders, such as depression, and substance use disorder. 7.  The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 8.7%, with 10% of men and 6% of women being diagnosed at any point in time. 8.  In the U.S., there are about 300,000 cases per year. 9.  There are no known cures for PTSD, but there are treatments that can help manage symptoms. 10.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatment are the mainstay treatments of PTSD. 11.  In CBT, a person works through their trauma memory and learns coping skills to help them overcome their fear. 12.  There are also medications that can help with the management of PTSD symptoms, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).","1. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for more than a month after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play. 2. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common cause of chronic abdominal pain and cramping. Although IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort, it doesn't cause any damage to the intestines. IBS is common, occurring in about 12 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. population. IBS is typically a long-term condition that tends to recur over time. Symptoms of IBS generally begin during the teen or early adult years, although it's possible to develop the condition at any age. In most people who have IBS, the abdominal pain and other symptoms are intermittent rather than constant. In IBS, the abnormalities of the bowel are only found on an elevated level of discomfort, which is the reason why IBS is also called a functional gastrointestinal disorder. 3. It is estimated that 20% to 30% of people who have PTSD also have IBS, and as many as 40% to 80% of people who have IBS have PTSD. Studies suggest that IBS is two to three times more common in people who have PTSD than in the general population. People who have PTSD and IBS are more likely to have other functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia (a ""sensation"" of impending heartburn) or functional constipation. 4.

If the tumor is small, a laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery can be done. 5. During surgery, the surgeon will try to find the tumor and remove it. 6. If the tumor is large or if it cannot be found, the surgeon will do a ""pancreatectomy"" (removal of the entire pancreas). 7. Most insulinomas are benign (non-cancerous). Only about 10% of insulinomas are cancerous. 8. After the tumor is removed, blood tests will be done to make sure that your symptoms have improved. 9. You will need to see your doctor regularly after surgery to make sure that the symptoms do not return.",1) The National Institutes of Health has a database of clinical trials for various diseases.

"1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs in women who have had excessive bleeding during pregnancy or childbirth. It is caused by the failure of the pituitary gland to produce hormones that regulate thyroid and ovarian function.2. The most common symptom is the failure to start menstruating at puberty (primary amenorrhea). Other symptoms may include infertility, fatigue, and weakness.3. Diagnosis is based on a careful medical history and physical examination. Blood tests can help confirm the diagnosis.4. Treatment involves the use of hormones to replace any hormones that the body is not producing.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is the result of postpartum pituitary necrosis. It is caused by severe hypotension and hypovolemia during or after childbirth. 2. It can lead to failure of lactation, amenorrhea, breast atrophy, and signs of hypothyroidism. 3. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, and it is confirmed by the demonstration of low prolactin levels. 4. Since the pituitary gland is also responsible for the production of growth hormone, its deficiency can also lead to the development of adult growth hormone deficiency, which can cause a decrease in growth velocity. 5. The main consequence of this condition is the development of secondary hypertension, which is due to elevated levels of renin and other vasoactive substances.","1. Sheehan's syndrome occurs following severe postpartum hemorrhage causing pituitary necrosis and resulting in pan-hypopituitarism. 2. The pituitary gland regulates the function of other endocrine glands and hormones, so the consequences of Sheehan's syndrome include failure of lactation, fatigue, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. 3. The diagnosis may have been missed in the past because of lack of awareness of the condition and the fact that the symptoms are very nonspecific.","1) Sheehan syndrome is a condition that results from reduced blood supply to the pituitary gland during childbirth. In severe cases, the reduced blood supply can lead to permanent damage to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces hormones that control many body functions, including the production of milk in women. Reduced function of the pituitary gland can lead to problems with milk production and other hormone-related health problems. 2) Some women may not realize they have Sheehan syndrome until they try to breast-feed their baby. Others may not experience symptoms until later in life. 3) A doctor may diagnose Sheehan syndrome by measuring hormones in the blood. They may also ask about symptoms and perform a physical exam.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that can occur after severe bleeding and hypotension following childbirth. It can cause problems with lactation and menstruation. 2. It is also sometimes called postpartum pituitary gland failure.3. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that control other hormone levels in the body.4. In people with Sheehan's syndrome, the pituitary gland does not work correctly. This can affect the production of thyroid hormones, as well as hormones that help regulate blood pressure and body temperature.5. The symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome can be mild or severe, depending on how much the pituitary gland has been affected. Mild symptoms include fatigue, low energy, and decreased libido. Severe symptoms include problems with lactation, menstrual periods, and low blood pressure.6. The diagnosis is made by measuring hormone levels.7. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Replacing thyroid hormones and other hormones may be needed.","1.

Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. 

To determine if you are overweight or obese, your doctor will compare your weight with that of healthy people of the same age and gender. Your doctor may also use a measurement called a body mass index, or BMI. BMI is a measure of body fat. 

People with obesity have a high risk of developing disorders that include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, and some cancers. 

To treat obesity, you will most likely need a combination of 

1. Changing your eating habits and food choices
2. Increasing your physical activity
3. Learning new, healthy ways to deal with stressful times
4. Getting support from family and friends

Some people may also need medicines or surgery. 

To keep off excess weight, you will need to make permanent changes in your daily routine. This may mean 

1. Changing the way you eat, including eating fewer calories and less fat
2. Making sure you get 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day
3. Including strength training exercises
4. Avoiding sugary drinks

"1)No one is to blame for obesity. Obesity is a result of interaction between genetic and environmental factors.2)Yes. By increasing price of unhealthy foods, the consumption of such foods would reduce, and thereby reduce obesity.3)Preventing obesity begins with healthy eating habits in childhood. Parents should provide healthy food and let children decide how much to eat. Avoid eating meals and snacks just before TV time - this can lead to overeating.4)Regular exercise along with healthy eating helps to maintain a healthy body weight. It also reduces risk of many diseases like diabetes, heart diseases etc.5)Yes, government should be involved in tackling obesity. Schools can play an important role in obesity prevention by providing healthy food and encouraging physical activity. Government should make efforts to increase access to healthy foods and safe places to play.6)We should cut down on fatty foods and eat more of fresh fruits, vegetables and salads.","1. Obesity has many causes including genetic and environmental factors. The rise of obesity is due to a combination of these factors. 2. Yes, a junk food tax would be effective in reducing obesity rates because it would decrease the consumption of unhealthy foods and increase the consumption of healthy foods. 3. Preventing obesity involves eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight. 4. Engaging in 30 minutes of daily exercise and a healthy diet has many advantages including weight loss, increased energy, and improved cardiovascular health. 5. The government should play a significant role in combating obesity because obesity has become a major public health problem. 6. The most critical dietary component to limit or eliminate to combat obesity is saturated fat.","1) Lack of physical activity and the overconsumption of energy dense foods are the primary causes of obesity. Obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy (calorie) intake and energy expenditure. 2) Yes, I believe that imposing a tax on unhealthy foods will lead to a decrease in obesity cases. By making these foods more expensive, individuals will be less likely to purchase and consume them. This will lead to a decrease in consumption and hopefully a decrease in obesity. 3) Prevention of obesity should begin early in life. Parents and caregivers should provide children with a nutritious diet and encourage physical activity. Schools should provide healthy meals and ample opportunity for physical activity. The community should have access to safe places for exercise, such as parks and bike trails. 4) There are many benefits to a daily routine that includes 30 minutes of exercise and a balanced diet. These habits can help prevent obesity and improve overall health. Physical activity can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. A balanced diet can reduce the risk of heart disease, hypertension, and obesity. 5) Yes, I believe the government should take a more active role in addressing the obesity epidemic. The government can create and enforce policies that encourage healthy lifestyles and discourage unhealthy ones. This could include taxes on unhealthy foods, limits on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, and subsidies for healthy foods. 6) I would prioritize reducing or eliminating sugar sweetened beverages. These beverages are high in calories and provide little nutritional value. Consumption of these beverages has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems.","1) Factors contributing to obesity include the increased availability of energy-dense foods, the decreased physical activity levels in our society, the convenience of our food environment, the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, and the presence of sugars in the diet. These factors all play a role in the development of obesity. 2) A tax on junk food may be helpful in reducing obesity rates because it would make these foods more expensive and less accessible to consumers. Additionally, the revenue generated from such a tax could be used to fund obesity prevention and intervention programs. 3) Preventing obesity involves promoting healthy diets and lifestyles at an early age, providing nutrition education for all age groups, increasing access to healthy foods, and creating safe environments for physical activity. 4) The advantages of regular exercise and a healthy diet include improved physical fitness, weight control, improved cardiovascular health, improved bone health, improved mental health, and reduced risk of various chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. 5) Yes, I believe the government should be more involved in efforts to combat obesity. The government can enact policies that promote healthy lifestyles, such as taxing unhealthy foods, providing incentives for healthy food choices, and improving access to safe exercise opportunities. 6) The most important dietary change we can make to reduce obesity is to reduce our intake of added sugars. These can be found in soft drinks, fruit drinks, cakes and cookies, and snack foods.","1. Obesity is caused by many factors including genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors. 2. Yes, a tax on unhealthy foods would help reduce obesity because it would make these foods more expensive and less accessible to consumers. 3. Obesity can be prevented by increasing physical activity levels and making healthy food choices. 4. Regular exercise has many benefits including strengthening the heart and lungs, improving flexibility, reducing stress, improving sleep, controlling weight, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Eating a healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrients to stay healthy. 5. The role of the government should be limited when it comes to obesity prevention. The individual must take responsibility for their own health and make the necessary lifestyle changes to improve their health. 6. Saturated and trans fats should be limited or avoided to reduce obesity. These types of fat are found in full-fat dairy products, fried foods, and processed meats.","1. The growing obesity problem is the fault of both the individuals and the society as a whole. Individuals need to take responsibility for their own health and well-being and society needs to provide the necessary infrastructure and support to aid them in this endeavor. In addition, food manufacturers need to produce healthier products and market them in a way that promotes healthy living rather than unhealthy snacking. 2. Taxing junk food may not necessarily reduce obesity rates. Obesity is the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Taxing junk food may reduce the amount of junk food consumed, but if people do not compensate by either eating less healthy food or exercising more, the net effect may be negligible. 3. Preventing obesity can be done on an individual level by instilling good eating habits and emphasizing physical activity at a young age. On a societal level, it involves promoting healthy living through education, infrastructure design (i.e. building sidewalks and biking trails), and economic incentives (i.e. subsidizing gym memberships). 4. Engaging in regular exercise and a balanced diet provide numerous advantages. Exercise improves cardiovascular health, improves mood, builds strong bones and increases longevity. A balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients for good health, reduces the risk of developing certain diseases such as heart disease and certain cancers, and reduces the risk of obesity. 5. The government should definitely take a more prominent role in combating obesity. Obesity is a significant public health problem that impacts the health and well-being of the population as well as the financial well-being of the healthcare system. The government should lead by example, both by encouraging healthy living among its employees and by promoting healthy living through policies such as subsidizing gym memberships and providing tax breaks for healthy food purchases. 6. The single most important dietary element to reduce to combat obesity is the amount of saturated and trans fats. These fats are known to increase the risk of developing obesity, heart disease, and certain cancers. By reducing the amount of these f"

The average age at which people with Lynch Syndrome develop colon cancer is 45 years old, which is about 10 to 20 years younger than the average age of people who develop colon cancer without Lynch Syndrome. 4. People with Lynch Syndrome also have an increased risk of developing a type of colon cancer called a colon adenocarcinoma. 5. Lynch Syndrome is caused by mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene. 6. Individuals with a family history of Lynch Syndrome should talk with a doctor about getting tested for the condition.","Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. People with Lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain and skin. Lynch syndrome is also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).","Lynch syndrome is an inherited disorder that causes an increased risk of developing colon cancer and rectal cancer.  People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of developing cancer of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin and prostate.  Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (cancer of the uterus).  Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  This means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of cancer.  People with Lynch syndrome have a 50% chance of passing it to each of their children.  The condition is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene.  The MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM genes normally make proteins that are involved in repairing errors that occur during the replication of DNA.  These proteins fix the errors that occur when DNA copies are made during cell division.  When one of these genes is mutated, the protein it makes does not work properly.  As a result, DNA replication is more likely to have errors, and the risk of cancer increases.  Research suggests that people with Lynch syndrome who have a mutation in the EPCAM gene are at risk for developing cancer of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.  The EPCAM gene normally makes a protein called Ep-Cam.  Researchers think that the Ep-Cam protein may be involved in the development of cancer.  People with Lynch syndrome who have a mutation in the EPCAM gene are more likely to develop cancer of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.","1.

What is Lynch syndrome?  Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that increases the risk of developing cancer. People with Lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin, and prostate. Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. 2. Who is at risk for Lynch syndrome?  Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. It is most commonly caused by a mutation in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene. These genes are involved in making proteins that help repair DNA damage. If these proteins are not working properly, there is an increased risk of cancer. The risk of Lynch syndrome is passed from parent to child. 3. What are the symptoms of Lynch syndrome?  People with Lynch syndrome often do not have any symptoms until they develop cancer. Some people with Lynch syndrome may have a family member who has also been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. 4. How is Lynch syndrome diagnosed?  To diagnose Lynch syndrome, genetic testing can be done to look for a mutation in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene. Other genes can also be tested if a mutation is found. Testing can be done on a blood sample or a piece of skin taken at a clinic. The sample is sent to a lab where the DNA is changed to a material that can be read by a computer. The computer looks for a specific mutation or change in the gene. Results may take 4 to 6 weeks. 5. How is Lynch syndrome treated?  There is no cure for Lynch syndrome. Treatment depends on the types of cancer that develop. People with Lynch syndrome should have regular checkups and imaging tests to find cancer early, when it is easier to treat. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and/or biological therapy may be used to treat cancer. 6. Are there any other concerns?  People with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of developing more than one type of cancer. This means that"
"Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  How It Develops  There is increased pressure in the eye. This is caused by too much fluid being made or not enough fluid draining from the eye.  The increased pressure may be due to:      Buildup of fluid in the eye. This can happen if the eye is formed abnormally, or if there is a problem with the drainage canals.  Partial blockage of the drainage canals. This can happen if the canals are narrowed by glaucoma or other eye diseases.  An increase in the amount of fluid produced in the eye. This can happen if the eye is formed abnormally or if certain medicines are taken.  There is also a rare form of glaucoma called angle-closure glaucoma. With this type, the angle in the eye where fluid leaves becomes blocked. This causes a sudden rise in pressure in the eye.  Symptoms  In the early stages of glaucoma, there are no symptoms. Later, you may have side vision (tunnel vision) and see halos around lights. Redness and pain are not common, but they can happen. Your eye may seem to have a blue or grey tint.  Diagnosis  Your doctor will use drops that dilate your pupil and look at your eye with a slit lamp. This is a type of microscope that gives a narrow view of the eye. Your doctor may also do other tests, including:  A glaucoma test that measures the pressure in the eye  A cornea mapper that measures the shape of the cornea  A slit lamp with a Placido disc to check your optic nerve  A computer-controlled scan that checks how the pupil and the cornea work together  A gonioscope to check the flow of fluid in the eye  An ophthalmoscope to check the inside of the eye  A field exam to check side vision  Your doctor may also do a nerve fiber layer measurement.

Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. It is usually a chronic, slowly progressive condition that develops over many years. In open-angle glaucoma, fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss if the nerve damage is not treated. 4. Closed-angle glaucoma, also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a much more rare form of glaucoma. It is a sudden-onset, emergency condition that causes extremely high pressure inside the eye. Closed-angle glaucoma is much more rare than open-angle glaucoma, but is more likely to damage the eye and cause vision loss if not treated quickly. 5. The most common type of open-angle glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It accounts for about 90 percent of all cases of glaucoma. 6.

"1. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of an infant that is under one year of age and whose cause of death is not immediately obvious prior to investigation.2. SIDS most often occurs when babies are between two and four months old, but it can happen at any age.3. In most cases, SIDS is thought to result from an abnormality in the baby's brain stem that disrupts the autonomic control of breathing, heart rate, temperature and blood pressure.4. Another theory suggests that SIDS is caused by a problem with the infant immune system.5. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that health care professionals use the term SIDS instead of sudden death in an infant or infantile death.6. According to the AAP, the term SIDS should only be used to describe sudden and unexpected death in an infant that is unexplained by a thorough postmortem examination.7. The AAP also states that health care professionals should use the term SIDS when the death of an infant is the result of an unknown cause even if the circumstances are suspicious.8. In addition, the AAP notes that health care professionals should not use the term SIDS if they are uncertain about the cause of death.9.

Although health care professionals don't know what causes SIDS, they do know ways to reduce the risk. These include: 4. Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. ""Tummy time"" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching 5. Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet 6. Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area 7. Making sure babies don't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult. 8.

"1. Hernias occur when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weakness in the muscle or connective tissue that holds it in place. 2. There are several kinds of hernias. 3. A hiatal hernia is a type of hiatus hernia. It occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes upward into your chest. 4. A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weakness in the muscle or connective tissue that holds it in place. 5. Hiatal hernias are often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 6. Other types of hernias include: 7. An inguinal hernia, which happens when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the groin. 8. A ventral hernia, which occurs when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the belly button (umbilicus). 9. An umbilical hernia, which happens when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the belly button (umbilicus). 10. A femoral hernia, which happens when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the upper leg (femoral). 11. A spigelian hernia, which happens when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the belly button (Spigelian fossa). 12. A diaphragmatic hernia, which happens when tissue pushes through the abdominal wall into the chest (diaphragm). 13. A pantaloon hernia, which is a combination of an inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia. 14. The symptoms of a hiatal hernia are similar to those of GERD. 15. You may need tests such as an endoscopy, where a tube with a camera is put down your throat so your doctor can look at your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. A barium swallow X-ray can also help your doctor see your esophagus and stomach. 16. Treatment depends on your symptoms and the cause of the hern","1. Yes, we can help you with that. Hernias are a common problem and can be treated by a general surgeon. 2. We will need to perform some tests to determine the type of hernia that you have. This will include a physical examination of your abdomen and groin area to look for any lumps or bulges. We will also need to conduct an ultrasound of your abdomen to determine the extent of the hernia. 3. Once we know the type and size of the hernia, we can discuss with you the best treatment options which may include surgery.","1) Inguinal hernia repair is one of our specialties. We offer both open and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. 2) We also perform procedures for femoral hernia repair and umbilical hernia repair. 3) We can provide wound care management for incisional, inguinal, and umbilical hernias.","1. Hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes through the diaphragm (the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen).2. Umbilical hernia. An umbilical hernia occurs when abdominal contents -- usually fat or part of the small intestine -- push through a weakness in the umbilical (belly button) area. 3. Incisional hernia. An incisional hernia occurs when abdominal contents push through a weakness in the abdominal wall that occurs next to a scar from a prior surgery.4. Epigastric hernia. An epigastric hernia occurs when abdominal contents push through the abdominal wall in the middle upper part of the abdomen.5. Lumbar hernia. A lumbar hernia occurs when abdominal contents push through a weakness in the lumbar area (in the lower back).6. Obturator hernia. An obturator hernia occurs when abdominal contents push through the obturator foramen (an opening in the hip bone) and into the groin.7. Spigelian hernia. A spigelian hernia occurs when abdominal contents push through a weakness that occurs along the side of the abdominal wall, below the belly button, but above the groin.8. Richter's hernia. A Richter's hernia occurs when only part of the intestine pushes through the abdominal wall. It usually occurs in a surgical scar from a prior operation.9. Penetrating hernia. A penetrating hernia occurs when a wound in the abdominal wall -- caused by a penetrating injury such as a bullet -- allows abdominal contents to push through.10. Strangulated hernia. A strangulated hernia occurs when abdominal contents that push through the abdominal wall become trapped. This can cut off the blood supply to the tissue and cause serious problems.","1. Hernias can be treated with surgery, but some may be treated without surgery. 2. Surgery is the best treatment for most hernias. Surgery is usually scheduled for an outpatient procedure. 3. A hernia repair may be done by open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. 4. Recovery time is faster with laparoscopic surgery. 5. The most common repair for hernias is the ""open hernia repair."" 6. In an open hernia repair, the surgeon makes an incision in the groin. 7. The surgeon then locates the hernia defect and separates the muscle layers. 8. The surgeon repairs the hernia by sewing or patching the weakened abdominal wall tissue. 9. The surgeon then closes the incision. 10. After surgery, you will probably feel some pain and discomfort. 11. You will probably go home the same day. 12. You will have some bruising and swelling around the area of the incision. 13. You will have some discomfort and pain in the area. 14. You will have stitches to be removed 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. 15. You will probably be able to return to work and other normal activities 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.","1) Consult with a Surgeon to review your medical history, conduct a physical examination, and order diagnostic tests to determine the type of hernia you have. 2) Depending on the severity of your hernia, your surgeon may recommend watchful waiting, surgery, or other treatments. 3) If surgery is advised, your surgeon will discuss the type of anesthesia that's best for you. 4) After surgery, you'll receive instructions for wound care and may be advised to limit your physical activity for a short period of time. 5) If you experience complications after surgery, your surgeon may need to manage them, possibly with additional surgery."

"1. Meesmann corneal dystrophy occurs due to a genetic defect in the production of a corneal protein called keratin-12. Keratin-12 helps to keep the outer layer of the cornea healthy. 2. As this protein is not produced properly, the outer layer of the cornea becomes weak and eventually deteriorates. 3. This causes the symptoms of blurred vision, discomfort and sensitivity to light. 4. As the condition worsens, the cornea becomes scarred and vision deteriorates even further. 5. Treatment options are as follows: 6. Epithelial debridement: The loose, dead cells on the outer layer of the cornea are removed using a fine brush or a laser. 7. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (laser keratectomy): The excimer laser is used to remove the outer layer of the cornea. This can be repeated several times until the symptoms improve. 8. Contact lenses: These can help to protect the cornea and also improve vision. 9. Corneal transplant: This is a last resort and is only recommended if the other treatments do not work. 10. NIACIN: High doses of the vitamin niacin can also help to slow down the progression of the condition. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","1. Meesmann corneal dystrophy is a very rare corneal dystrophy, and it is autosomal recessive in inheritance. 2. There is no definitive treatment for this condition, although a few procedures like PRK/LASEK/Epi-LASIK have been tried with limited success. 3. Topical lubricants are helpful in providing symptomatic relief. 4. Use of UV-protecting glasses is recommended. 5. It is important that the patient be examined by an ophthalmologist at regular intervals (6 monthly) to look for any early corneal changes which can be treated before they progress to irreversible stage.","1. The diagnosis of Meesmann corneal dystrophy is established clinically based on the appearance of the corneal dystrophy. 2. The mainstay of treatment is routine ophthalmologic examination to monitor the corneal health and interventions to minimize complications. 3. When corneal epithelial erosions occur, they can be treated conservatively with lubricant eye drops and ointment, soft contact lenses, and avoidance of triggers (e.g., wind, smoke). 4. When corneal epithelial erosions do not heal after 2 weeks of conservative treatment, debridement of the corneal epithelium using a diamond burr can be performed. 5. When corneal opacity interferes with vision, the epithelial debridement can be performed in combination with laser phototherapeutic keratectomy. 6. When corneal stromal scarring is present, corneal transplantation may be necessary.","1. Meesmann Corneal Dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of tiny cysts in the outer layer of the eye (cornea). The condition is usually painless, and vision is rarely affected. However, some people with Meesmann Corneal Dystrophy experience irritation and discomfort that can be relieved by simply removing the corneal epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea. 2. Meesmann Corneal Dystrophy is a very mild disease, and usually, no treatment is needed. When symptoms occur, they can be managed by removing the corneal epithelium. 3. In rare cases, vision may be affected, and in these cases, a corneal transplant may be necessary. 4. Avoiding irritants like smoke and dust may help prevent attacks. Wearing protective glasses also may be helpful.","1) Meesmann corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder, and it worsens with age.2) The main treatment is the removal of the dense superficial epithelial plaques. This can be done in the office using a Nd:YAG laser.3) Once the superficial plaques are removed, the underlying cornea is much clearer and the vision improves.4) The pain during flare-ups is from the superficial epithelial plaques. Once they are removed, the pain goes away.5) The photosensitivity is due to the superficial plaques. Once they are removed, the photosensitivity goes away.","1. Meesmann corneal dystrophy is characterized by corneal deposits at the level of the basal epithelium and Bowman membrane, in a reticular pattern.

The study, which began in 1978, included over 500 women diagnosed with stage I and II ovarian cancer. The women were either assigned to receive standard treatment or no further treatment. The women who received no further treatment after their initial surgery and chemotherapy had significantly lower survival rates than the women who received the standard treatment. Follow-up studies of the women who received standard treatment showed that 30 percent of the women had a recurrence of the cancer during the first two years after their initial treatment. The NCI report states that the women who received standard treatment also had a higher quality of life than the women who received no further treatment. The NCI report also describes a clinical trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCICCTG). The study included over 600 women diagnosed with stage I and II ovarian cancer. The women were either assigned to receive standard treatment or no further treatment. The women who received no further treatment after their initial surgery and chemotherapy had significantly lower survival rates than the women who received the standard treatment.

If he develops symptoms such as rash, fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes, please contact a doctor.","1. The MMR vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. Infants should get the first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. Children should get the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.2. Some states allow certain health care professionals to give the MMR vaccine to children as young as 12 months of age. Check with your local health department to see if this exception is allowed in your area.3. The MMR vaccine is usually given as a shot in the shoulder.4. The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Most children have no side effects from the vaccine. Some may have mild side effects, such as a rash, fever, or swollen glands.","1. The answer to your question is that the chance of contracting rubella is very low, especially if your grandson has had at least one rubella vaccine. 2. The vaccine is about 95% effective, so there is a 5% chance of getting rubella even after having been vaccinated.3. The chance of getting rubella is higher if your grandson has not had the vaccine.4. In addition, the vaccine is not 100% effective in everyone who gets it. Some people will not develop immunity to rubella, even after having had a rubella vaccine.5. Rubella is most dangerous during pregnancy. If your daughter-in-law is not immune to rubella and becomes infected during pregnancy, there is a risk of her baby being born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).6. Rubella is not dangerous for adults, but it is for babies.","1. Yes, you should take precautions. Rubella spreads through close personal contact with infected people. It spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Rubella is also spread through direct contact with the nose or throat secretions of an infected person. 2. Rubella is a very contagious viral infection that can cause serious health problems, including birth defects and miscarriage. Infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable. 3. Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus spreads through close personal contact. Rubella is also spread through direct contact with the nose or throat secretions of an infected person. The risk of catching rubella is greatest when a person is in contact with others who have the disease. 4. Rubella vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Infants should get the MMR vaccine (measles-mumps-rubella) at 12 through 15 months of age, and then again at 4 through 6 years of age. It is important for all members of the household and all members of the child's social circle to be vaccinated, if they are not immune to rubella."

"1. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and other structures in the body. It is a sub-type of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a rare, inherited, genetic disorder that affects the cilia (small hair-like structures inside the body). Cilia help to move fluids and mucus in the body. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia have cilia that do not work properly. Because of this, they have repeated lung and sinus infections. Kartagener's syndrome is a sub-type of primary ciliary dyskinesia. People with Kartagener's syndrome have problems with their sinuses and lungs, as well as other structures in their body. 2. People with Kartagener's syndrome have a defect in their cilia. The cilia inside the body help to move mucus and fluids. In people with Kartagener's syndrome, the cilia do not move correctly. This causes problems with the movement of mucus and fluids in the body. The mucus and fluids build up in different parts of the body, including the sinuses and lungs. The buildup of mucus and fluids can lead to repeated lung and sinus infections. The cilia also help to protect the lining of the lung from being destroyed by the acid in the stomach. In Kartagener's syndrome, the cilia do not move correctly, and this can lead to the acid in the stomach moving up into the lungs. This can lead to lung damage. 3. The most common symptoms of Kartagener's syndrome are sinus and lung infections. People with Kartagener's syndrome have frequent infections of the sinuses (the air-filled spaces behind the cheekbones and between the eyes) and the lungs. These infections usually start in early childhood. People with Kartagener's syndrome often have symptoms of chronic sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses) and chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the airways). Other common symptoms include 4. Diagnosis of Kartagener'","1. Fertility is usually not affected by Kartagener's syndrome. However, it is possible for affected individuals to have difficulty conceiving due to other factors associated with Kartagener's, such as male infertility, recurrent sinus and respiratory infections, and/or chronic diseases. 2. A person with Kartagener's may also experience other symptoms, such as bronchiectasis (permanent dilation and destruction of the bronchi and bronchioles), chronic sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), and otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear).","1. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when the cilia in the respiratory tract and the reproductive tract are not working properly. 2. The syndrome is named after the scientist who first described it. 3. It is also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia. 4. People with this condition have a constant mucus build-up in their lungs and chronic respiratory infections, such as sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. 5. They also have a build-up of mucus in their reproductive tract, which can cause infertility (inability to become pregnant). 6. There are other symptoms that may occur in people with Kartagener's syndrome. 7. These include deafness, chronic sinus infections, and situs inversus, which is a condition in which the organs in the body are in the wrong location. 8.

Treatment focuses on managing symptoms.","1. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the cilia in your body. 2. Cilia are tiny hairs that line the respiratory tract, the tubes that carry food from your mouth to your stomach and the ducts of your sweat glands. 3. Kartagener's syndrome is characterized by an absence or shortening of these hairs, which interferes with your body's ability to keep itself clean. 4. The result is often chronic respiratory infections, sinus infections and ear infections beginning in childhood. 5. Because the cilia also help to move the sperm, men with this condition may have low sperm count, abnormal sperm shape or movement problems in the sperm. 6. This can lead to infertility.","1. People with Kartagener's syndrome are usually infertile because their sperm cannot move properly. 2. Other symptoms include: Deafness Dry eyes Dry mouth Enlarged tonsils Infertility Sinusitis Wet, stuffy nose","1. Kartagener's syndrome is a genetic disorder involving a triad of symptoms: chronic sinusitis, recurrent lung infections, and infertility. 2.

Macular degeneration can cause a person to experience problems with depth perception, which can lead to dizziness or falls.",96% of patients reported that having macular degeneration in one eye only does not cause dizziness.,"Yes, it can.  The fovea in the center of the retina is the point where the optic nerve enters the retina and is responsible for sharp and detailed vision.  The macula is the area just adjacent to the fovea.  If the macula degenerates then the vision will be blurred and distorted.  This can lead to an individual feeling as if they are falling or spinning.  This is more likely to occur when the other eye also has macular degeneration.","1. The answer to your question is yes, it is possible for macular degeneration in one eye to trigger dizziness.2. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.3. It causes problems with vision, especially in low light.4. AMD usually happens gradually, and there may be little or no noticeable effect on vision.5. However, if the macula is damaged, central vision is affected and patients may experience distortion or suffer a loss of vision in one part or all of their vision.6. Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in people aged over 50 in the UK.7. The disease affects men and women equally, and usually develops as people get older.8. It is rare for people under the age of 70 to develop AMD, but as the population lives longer, more people are being diagnosed.9. Age-related macular degeneration is split into two types:10. Dry AMD, where there is gradual slow deterioration of vision over time, affecting most people.11. Wet AMD, where there is sudden loss of vision, usually associated with leaky blood vessels that develop under the retina.12. Symptoms of Age-related macular degeneration are:13. Gradual blurring of central vision14. Distortion of objects15. Shape and colour perception may appear faded or distorted16. Straight lines may look distorted17.

If your feet or ankles become swollen and sore, or you have trouble breathing, stop taking Allopurinol and call your doctor right away.","200 mg of Allopurinol daily is a low dose, and if you are not experiencing a significant reduction in your gout symptoms, it may be worthwhile discussing with your doctor whether a higher dose is appropriate. Allopurinol is used to lower uric acid levels in the blood, and therefore reduce the risk of gout attacks. It does this by inhibiting an enzyme called xanthine oxidase which is responsible for producing uric acid. Swelling in the feet is a common side effect of Allopurinol, and can result from the accumulation of fluid in the tissues. Diuretics are sometimes used in conjunction with Allopurinol to reduce the swelling, but this should only be done under the supervision of a doctor. Diuretics are not always necessary, and can cause complications if not used correctly. Your doctor will be able to assess whether a diuretic is necessary for you to take, and if so, which one is most suitable.","1. You are right. Diuretics can be used along with allopurinol to decrease the swelling. Diuretics will increase the excretion of uric acid through urine. 2. But, allopurinol and diuretics can interact with each other. Allopurinol can increase the toxicity of the diuretics. So, dose of diuretics should be decreased when you are on allopurinol. 3. You should discuss with your treating doctor regarding the use of diuretics. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.","1. If you are taking allopurinol for gout, and if you are still experiencing foot swelling, you should be concerned about taking a diuretic on top of this medication. 2. Allopurinol is a medication used to treat high levels of uric acid in the blood. Allopurinol works by preventing the formation of uric acid crystals, which are responsible for causing gout. 3. Diuretics are medications that are used to remove excess water and sodium from the body. Diuretics are often used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and other conditions. 4. There are two concerns when taking allopurinol with a diuretic. First, both medications can cause a decrease in potassium levels. Decreased potassium levels can cause muscle weakness, nausea, and other problems. The chance of low potassium is greater when allopurinol is taken with a loop diuretic (such as furosemide or bumetanide). 5. Second, both medications can cause a decrease in calcium levels. Decreased calcium levels can cause muscle cramps and other problems. The chance of low calcium is greater when allopurinol is taken with a thiazide diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or indapamide). 6. You should discuss these concerns with your doctor.","1. Continue taking allopurinol and see if the swelling goes away.2. If there is no improvement, consider taking allopurinol with a diuretic.3. The combination of allopurinol and diuretics may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.4. There is also an increased risk of allopurinol toxicity.5. This combination may also result in hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels in the blood).6. Before taking allopurinol with a diuretic, inform your doctor if you are allergic to allopurinol or any other medications.7. In addition, inform your doctor if you have any of the following conditions: heart failure, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, and diabetes.8. Allopurinol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication."

"Guanfacine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.    Guanfacine works by controlling the nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways.

Acid production in the stomach is controlled by the parietal cells in the stomach lining.  When parietal cells are stimulated, they produce an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).  COX-1 conves arachidonic acid into prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins stimulate the parietal cells to produce even more COX-1 enzyme, thereby increasing acid production.  Aspirin inhibits COX-1 enzyme production, thereby decreasing acid production. 4. However, Tylenol does not inhibit COX-1 or COX-2 enzymes.  Therefore, Tylenol does not decrease acid production. 5. When excessive acid is produced, it can literally eat a hole through the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine, thereby causing a peptic ulcer. 6. Ingestion of Tylenol causes the parietal cells to produce COX-1 enzyme, thereby increasing acid production.  Acid production can literally eat a hole through the stomach lining or small intestine, thereby causing an ulcer. 7. The ulcerative pain appears to be caused by the excessive acid production, not by Tylenol. 8. You can prevent the ulcerative pain by taking one gram of nonparticulate antacids (such as Maalox) every four hours while you are taking Tylenol. 9. You should also avoid foods that stimulate acid production, such as excessively spicy foods, excessively caffeinated foods, excessively alcoholic foods, excessively fatty foods, and excessively acidic foods (such as citrus fruits and fruit juices).","1. The most common causes of peptic ulcer disease are Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory PMC-LLaMA. 2. NSAIDs cause ulcers by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the gastrointestinal tract. Prostaglandins help protect the stomach lining from ulcers. Without them, the lining is more vulnerable to damage from the digestive enzymes in the stomach.3. If you are experiencing pain, you should stop taking Tylenol. You might consider trying a different pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which is less likely to cause ulcers. Talk to your doctor about alternatives.4. Your doctor will probably evaluate your stomach with an endoscopy to determine if you have an NSAID-related ulcer. If the cause is H. pylori, you will be prescribed antibiotics to clear the infection.5. In addition to avoiding NSAIDs, you should also avoid alcohol, tobacco, and excess caffeine. These substances can all irritate the stomach lining.6. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and avoid fatty, spicy, and acidic foods.7. Do not lie down after eating until the food has passed into your small intestine.8. Avoid taking any medications that irritate the stomach lining, including aspirin and other NSAIDs.9. You can try taking antacids, which reduce the amount of acid in your stomach, or protein pump inhibitors, which decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach. Both types of medication can promote healing of ulcers.","1. Tylenol is not aspirin. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a totally different type of PMC-LLaMA. 2.

Tylenol (acetaminophen) is not an NSAID and does not cause ulcers. However, because it can be metabolized to a compound that is potentially toxic to the liver, it should not be taken in high doses. 3. High doses of Tylenol (more than 325 mg every 4 hours, or more than 650 mg per day) can cause hepatic injury. 4. The most common side effect of Tylenol is nausea and vomiting. 5. If you are having recurrent ulcers that may be caused by aspirin or NSAIDs, avoid taking Tylenol in high doses.","1. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is not related to peptic ulcers. Acetaminophen is metabolized primarily in the liver. Only a small amount is metabolized in the intestines. 2. The second day of Tylenol use, you may be experiencing side effects of the medication. You can experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. 3. It is important to know that Tylenol can be dangerous if taken in excessive amounts. Acetaminophen toxicity can occur with dosages that exceed 4000 mg (4 grams or 40 tablets of 500 mg or 325 mg) over a 24-hour period. 4.

"12 years ago I was bitten by tick while deer hunting. The bite area contained the ring as described in Lyme Disease symptoms.  I was treated with antibiotics; however, ever since that time I have many of the symptoms cited for Lyme. Also, usually prior to, and during these symptoms I have a reddish-pink welt appear at the site of the bite on my groin. Can you offer any enlightment on my condition? Thanks for posting your query to PMC-LLaMA. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by the bite of ticks carrying a bacterium known as Cordelia burgdorferi. If left untreated, infection can spread from the skin to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Lyme disease is curable with antibiotics, if treatment is sought early in the course of the illness. Lyme disease may cause what's known as ""post-treatment Lyme disease syn PMC-LLaMA.  So I suggest you to contact to your treating physician and ask for treatment. Hope my answer will help you. Take care.","1. Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. I am PMC-LLaMA. 2. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria Cordelia burgdorferi. The disease is spread to humans by the bite of ticks carrying these bacteria. The first stage of the disease is characterized by fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic red skin rash. 3. In the second stage, the bacteria spread through the bloodstream causing symptoms such as heart palpitations, dizziness, extreme fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. 4. In the third stage, the disease can cause nervous system complications such as severe headache, neck pain, confusion, loss of memory, and pain and numbness in the extremities. 5. The diagnosis of Lyme Disease is based on symptoms, history of exposure to infected ticks, and blood tests to detect antibodies to the bacteria. 6. Treatment is with antibiotics, which are most effective early in the disease. Antibiotics used include penicillin, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone. If the disease is chronic, antibiotics such as penicillin or cephalexin may be prescribed for months. I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to answer.","1. Since you have been experiencing Lyme-like symptoms for so long, it is best to get a Lyme disease test done to rule out chronic Lyme disease. The test will be a blood test that checks for antibodies to the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 2. Antibiotic treatment is the first line of treatment for Lyme disease. Usually, oral doxycycline or amoxicillin is given for 14 to 21 days. If the disease is severe, IV antibiotics may be required. 3. If you have been experiencing these symptoms for a long time, then it is best to consult a physician immediately.","1.

"1. Smoking and nicotine have effects on every system in the body. 2. Smoking can increase the risk of digestive disorders such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gallstones. 3. Smoking also can lead to reduced salivary gland function, which can diminish the mouth's ability to cleanse itself and can cause dry mouth. 4. Smoking also can increase the risk of pancreatitis, and smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop inflammatory bowel disease and some liver diseases. 5. Smoking also may increase the risk of gallstones, which are hardened deposits of digestive fluid. 6. Nicotine and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood. This is why smokers often have red, flushed faces. The oxygen deficit caused by smoking reduces the digestive system's ability to remove gas from the digestive tract, causing bloating and constipation. 7. The nicotine and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke reduce the appetite, which may lead to weight loss. 8. Smoking can increase the risk of esophageal reflux disease, in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. 9. Smoking can increase the risk of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. 10. Smoking can increase the risk of colon polyps, which can be a precursor to colon cancer.","1. The use of nicotine results in a significant increase in the rate of gastric emptying. The rate of gastric emptying is the speed at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine. Gastric emptying is regulated by the enteric nervous system and can be influenced by a variety of factors including the osmotic pressure of the gastric contents, the composition of the meal, and the subject's emotional state.2. The present study demonstrated that the use of nicotine gum significantly accelerated gastric emptying, compared to the placebo gum, in a dose-dependent manner.3. The use of nicotine also resulted in increased small intestinal motility and increased the rate of gallbladder emptying.4. The rate of gastric emptying, small intestinal motility, and the rate of gallbladder emptying were all significantly increased 30 min after the nicotine gum administration, compared to the placebo gum administration. The effects of nicotine gum on gastrointestinal motility were still evident 2 h after administration.5. Nicotine gum administration resulted in significantly increased levels of circulating catecholamines, compared to placebo gum administration.6. The present study demonstrates that the use of nicotine gum results in significant increases in gastrointestinal motility, the rate of gastric emptying, and the rate of gallbladder emptying. These findings may explain the increased appetite and weight gain often associated with nicotine use.","1. Smoking has a negative effect on digestion and nutrient absorption. 2. Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which reduces blood flow to the digestive organs. This can cause indigestion, heartburn, and constipation. It can also cause the liver to produce fat, which can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 3. Smoking can increase the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis. 4. Smoking can increase the risk of gallstones and colon polyps. 5. Smoking can increase the risk of Crohn's disease and colon cancer.","1. Nicotine in the body is rapidly absorbed through the buccal mucosa, nasal passages, and skin. 2. Once absorbed, nicotine rapidly reaches the brain, where it binds to specific receptors. 3. The effect of nicotine is to mimic the effect of acetylcholine, resulting in a release of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. 4. This release causes the pleasurable effects associated with nicotine use, including the sensation of increased concentration and energy and a decrease in appetite. 5. The effect of nicotine is short-lived, and the smoker often feels the need to smoke again within a few hours. 6. Smoking cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including irritability, restlessness, anxiety, and an increased appetite.","1) Smoking increases gastric acid secretion. 2) Nicotine increases motility of the small intestine, which results in increased rate of absorption. 3) Increased gastric acid secretion may cause ulceration, which can impair absorption of nutrients. 4) Smoking increases the risk of pancreatitis, which can impair digestion and absorption. 5) Smoking increases risk of gallstones, which can impair digestion and absorption. 6) Smoking increases risk of diverticulosis, which can impair digestion and absorption.","1. Nicotine stimulates the central nervous system, causing the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Adrenaline increases the heart rate and causes vasoconstriction, while noradrenaline stimulates the brain and increases the activity of the digestive system. 2. Nicotine also causes the release of dopamine, which stimulates the brain's pleasure centers. 3. Smoking increases the risk of developing gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), which can lead to tooth loss. 4. Smoking also increases the risk of developing oral cancer, which causes tumors to form in the mouth. 5. Smoking can cause a decreased sense of taste and smell, which can reduce the enjoyment of food and may lead to a decreased appetite. 6. Smoking can cause inflammation of the pancreas, which can lead to pancreatitis. 7. Smoking can also cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can lead to heartburn and difficulty swallowing. 8. Smoking can cause diarrhea, constipation, and other bowel irregularities."
1. Yes. You still need to have a pap smear even if you have had a hysterectomy. 2. The reason for this recommendation is that there may still be abnormal cells in the vaginal epithelium even if you had a hysterectomy. 3. The epithelium of the vagina and cervix are very closely linked and therefore a hysterectomy does not guarantee that there are no abnormal cells left in the vagina. 4. It is important to continue to have pap smears because there is still a risk of developing vaginal cancer even if you have had a hysterectomy.,"1. Yes, you are still required to have a Pap smear because the cytology test can detect pre-cancerous or cancerous cells anywhere in the cervix or vagina. 2. Even if you had a total hysterectomy, the Pap smear will check the tissue around the uterus, the cervix, and the vagina. 3. If the pathology report shows abnormal results, it may mean that further testing is needed. 4. A total hysterectomy doesn't eliminate the risk of cervical cancer.","1. Yes, even after a total hysterectomy, you still need to get regular pap smears. 2. This is because the cervix is removed when you get a total hysterectomy, but the vagina and the upper part of the vagina (called the transformation zone) are still at risk for developing cervical cancer. 3. So, you still need to get pap smears every one to three years, depending on your risk factors.","1. Yes, it is still necessary to have a pap smear test done even if you have had a hysterectomy in 2006. 2. This is because, vaginal vault cancers can occur after a hysterectomy. 3. Vaginal cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). 4. HPV can be transmitted during vaginal intercourse and also by other methods. 5. Vaginal cancer is prevented by getting regular PAP tests done and also by getting immunized against HPV. 6. If your PAP smear shows any abnormalities, you may need to undergo a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.","1. Yes, you should still have regular Pap smears, especially if you are sexually active. 2. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women who have had a total hysterectomy and no history of CIN or cancer should have a Pap smear every 3 years beginning at age 25 and age 30 if you had your first Pap smear at age 26 or older. 3. If you have had CIN or cancer, you should have a Pap smear every year.","1. Yes, even if you have had a complete hysterectomy, you should still get Pap smears every one to two years. 2. This is because there can be abnormal cells develop in the vagina or cervix after hysterectomy. 3. If these are detected early, the chances of beating the disease improve. 4. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that women who have had a total hysterectomy should still get a Pap smear every one to two years. 5. The reason for this is that even though the uterus and cervix have been removed, there is still a small chance that abnormal cells could develop in the vagina. 6. It is also possible that some cancer cells were left behind during the surgery. 7. These could cause problems later on. 8. Regular Pap smears help to detect any problems early, when they are easier to treat."
1. You had a trauma and the spinal cord is hematoma. The spinal cord is not a structure that is easily repaired and so the treatment here is going to be palliative at best.2.

In this case, there is no definitive test to show dual spinal chamber. 2. MRI is the best diagnostic tool for evaluation of spinal cord abnormalities. 3. Lumbar puncture showing two chambers and a sixth lumbar upper back deformed spinal cord hematoma on T12 is suggestive of dual spinal chamber.","1. The symptoms of loss of feeling in the right leg, a sixth lumbar upper back deformed spinal cord hematoma on T12, and bladder issues, indicate that the patient is suffering from a spinal cord contusion.2. The presence of two chambers in the cerebral ventricles is indicative of hydrocephalus, which can be caused by a spinal cord contusion due to the blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow.3. A lumber puncture can show two chambers, and a hematoma in the spinal cord, but a conclusive diagnosis can only be made by imaging studies such as an MRI.","1. Lumbar Puncture: The patient's own description of symptoms is the most important factor in establishing the diagnosis of a Chiari II Malformation. Other important diagnostic tools include neuroimaging (MRI) and urodynamic studies. 2. MRI: Chiari II Malformations are best visualized on sagittal T2-weighted images. The cerebellar tonsils are usually positioned below the foramen magnum. Other findings include a small fourth ventricle, beaking of the ventricular margins, and downward displacement of the vermis and brainstem. The spinal cord is often abnormally low in position and may be associated with a syrinx. 3. Urodynamic Studies: A significant proportion of patients with Chiari II Malformations will have abnormal urodynamic studies. These studies are performed to assess for bladder dysfunction and detrusor instability.","1. A hematoma of the spinal cord is a collection of blood within the spinal cord. It can occur after trauma to the spine, spinal surgery, and as a rare complication of pregnancy.2. A hematoma of the spinal cord can cause symptoms similar to a spinal cord tumor including back pain, weakness of the legs, and sensory loss of the legs and lower abdomen.3. It can be diagnosed with an MRI of the spine, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish from a tumor.4. Occasionally, hematomas of the spinal cord can resolve by themselves.5.

What is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive, degenerative, genetic disease that affects the nervous system. The nervous system controls movement, sensation, and coordination. SCA3 causes uncoordinated, jerky muscle movements called ataxia. Symptoms of SCA3 usually begin between ages 20 and 60 years and worsen over time. Symptoms include uncoordinated speech, uncoordinated eye movements, unsteady gait (walking), and loss of sensation in the extremities (hands and feet). Other symptoms may include muscle cramps, twitches, and spasms; slowed movement; and muscle weakness. The disease can be fatal in the later stages, but some people with the condition live for many years. 2. How common is spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 affects between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 10,000 people. It occurs in all ethnic groups and is most common in the Caucasian population. The prevalence also varies from country to country, according to how many people carry the disease gene. 3. What causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 14. The gene carries instructions for making a protein called ataxin-3. Researchers think that the mutation causes ataxin-3 to become toxic to cells in the brain. This stops the cells from working normally, which results in the symptoms of SCA3. 4. What are the treatments for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?  No cure exists for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms. Physical therapy may help people improve balance and coordination. Speech therapy and devices to help with speech and swallowing may improve communication and nutrition. In some cases, medications may help reduce muscle spasms and rigidity","MedlinePlus connects you to information from the National Institutes of Health and other organizations.

HIV treatment consists of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines that stop the virus from multiplying (inhibitors).2. These include:a. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) - e.g., Zidovudine (AZT), Lamivudine (3TC), Stavudine (d4T), Didanosine (ddI), Zalcitabine (ddC), Abacavir (ABC), Emtricitabine (FTC)b. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) - e.g., Nevirapine (NVP), Efavirenz (EFV), Delavirdine (DLV)c. Protease inhibitors - e.g., Ritonavir (V)d. Integrase inhibitors - e.g., Roltegravir (T) and Elvitegravir (EVG)3. Other ARV medicines include:a. Entry inhibitors - e.g., Maraviroc (MRV)b. Fusion inhibitors - e.g., Enfuvirtide (binding partner - BNP)c. Integrase inhibitors - e.g., Roltegravir (T) and Elvitegravir (EVG)4. A treatment plan for HIV should be chosen with the help of an HIV specialist. It depends on the stage of the disease, CD4 count, and other factors.5. A combination of ARV medicines is recommended.6. HIV treatment should always include at least 2 ARV medicines that are effective against HIV (one of which should be a protease inhibitor, if the patient can tolerate it).7. The combination should include at least 1 medicine that acts on the viral entry process (a fusion inhibitor, entry inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor).8. The choice of medicines should be guided by the resistance profile of the virus.9. In advanced disease, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible.10. In some cases, treatment may be started immediately, regardless of CD4 count.11. In other cases, treatment is recommended only when the CD4 count drops below a certain level.12","1) All patients should be started on a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor (PI). 2) The most commonly used NRTIs in HIV treatment include lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (DDl), and stavudine (d4T). 3) Commonly used NNRTIs include efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), and delavirdine (DLV). 4) Commonly used PIs include ritonavir (V) or lopinavir (in combination with ritonavir, LPV/r), nelfinavir (NFV), amprenavir (APV), and saquinavir (SQV). 5) Commonly used INSTIs include dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL). 6) A baseline viral load should be obtained before starting therapy, and a follow-up viral load should be obtained three to six weeks after the therapy is initiated. 7) The goal of treatment is to reduce the viral load to <50 copies/mL. 8) The choice of which agent to use as initial therapy should be individualized based on the patient's history and medication side effect profile. 9) Specific guidelines for initiation and change of antiretroviral therapy (A) in pregnant women are available. 10) The most common side effects of antiretroviral therapy (A) include headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and altered sense of taste.","1. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all individuals diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of their CD4 count or clinical symptoms. 2. The goal of ART is to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to a level that is so low that the virus cannot be detected by a standard test. 3. People with HIV infection who maintain a viral load that is below the limit of detection, and have a CD4 count that is above a certain level (usually around 200 cells/mm3), have an HIV-infection that is considered well-controlled. 4. People with well-controlled HIV-infection are less likely to develop AIDS and less likely to transmit HIV to others. 5. When ART is taken consistently and correctly, it can reduce the risk of HIV transmission. 6. However, no medical treatment can cure HIV infection. 7. Even with ART, some HIV-infected individuals continue to shed HIV in their blood and body fluids. 8. Therefore, although HIV-positive people are not necessarily highly contagious, they should still take precautions to avoid transmitting the virus to others. 9. These precautions include practicing safer sex (using condoms and/or taking PrEP), not sharing needles or other injection drug equipment, and not donating blood, organs, or semen if they are HIV-positive. 10. People with HIV infection should inform their healthcare provider and sex partners about their HIV status. 11. People who are HIV-positive but do not have AIDS should also be aware that they can still transmit the virus to others. 12. HIV-positive people should also be aware of the symptoms of opportunistic infections (OIs) and should report any signs of OIs to their healthcare provider.","I'm glad to share my thoughts with you. One of the biggest challenges in treating HIV/AIDS is getting patients into care and keeping them there. Studies show that it's hard to retain patients in care because of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. Many clinics don't have a trans-friendly environment. A patient may be reluctant to disclose their HIV status or reveal their gender identity for fear of discrimination. They may also fear being outed as HIV-positive by having to share a waiting room with people they don't know. 

Another issue is medication adherence. Patients may have trouble taking their meds because of fear or confusion about the regimen. They may also feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of pills they have to take. And if they're not comfortable with their provider, they may not ask questions about their meds or treatment plan. 

So what can be done to break down these barriers? Here are a few ideas:

1. Create a trans-friendly environment. This means having staff trained in working with trans patients, having private areas for patients to discuss their health issues and getting patients' preferred names and pronouns used throughout the clinic.

2. Offer transportation and childcare. Many patients need help getting to the clinic or have no one to watch the kids while they're getting treatment.

3. Provide peer support. Having someone who understands what it's like to be HIV-positive and trans-identified there to offer support and answer questions can make a big difference.

4. Explain treatment clearly. Patients need to understand why it's so important to take their medications and what the consequences of not taking them will be. They also need to know what to do if they're having trouble adhering to the regimen.

5. Provide counseling and support. Many patients are depressed and anxious about their HIV/AIDS diagnosis. They need someone to talk to about their fears and worries.

6. Make treatment as convenient as possible. This means offering evening and weekend hours, having locations in the community rather than in medical centers and making sure patients know how to get refills or talk to a doctor if they have problems.","1.

"1. Sleep Apnea is due to obstruction of airway during sleep. It may be associated with systemic disease like Hypertension, Diabetes, CAD, Myxedema, Hypothyroidism, etc.2. Sleep Apnea is of two types - Obstructive and Central. Obstructive sleep apnea is due to obstruction in airway, while central sleep apnea is due to impaired central respiratory drive.3. OSA is more common and is often associated with daytime sleepiness, while CSA is less common and is not associated with daytime sleepiness.4. Treatment of OSA is CPAP and that of CSA is BPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure).5. CPAP provides constant Positive Airway Pressure and BPAP provides two levels of Positive Airway Pressure, one for expiration and other for inspiration.6. Since your diagnosis is OSA, you have been prescribed CPAP.7. CPAP therapy should be started immediately as untreated OSA is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.8. CPAP therapy is associated with several side effects like mask related issues, nasal congestion,",1 week,"1. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. These episodes can lead to abnormalities in the function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The primary treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which serves to keep the airway open during sleep. The benefits of CPAP include improved cardiovascular function, improved oxygenation, decreased daytime sleepiness, and decreased motor vehicle accidents. 2. This study was conducted to evaluate the short-term effects of CPAP use on edema. Acute left ventricular heart failure was excluded by the presence of a third heart sound and/or pulmonary crackles. 3. The study included 15 patients (10 men, five women; mean age: 56.4 +/- 11.4 years) with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 24.1 +/- 12.5 events/hour. Patients used a CPAP machine at home for an average of 4.4 +/- 2.5 hours per day. All patients had clinical evidence of peripheral edema at the time of study entry. 4. Patients were re-examined one day and one week after initiation of CPAP therapy. Fifteen patients had clinical evidence of peripheral edema at study entry. One day after initiation of therapy, 13 patients (86.7%) had improvement or resolution of peripheral edema. After one week of therapy, 11 patients (73.3%) had improvement or resolution of peripheral edema. 5.CPAP therapy results in short-term improvement or resolution of peripheral edema in patients with congestive heart failure and sleep apnea.","1. If you are using CPAP for the first time, it may take a few days to get used to it. If you are having trouble adjusting to your CPAP machine, talk to your doctor. You may need to go back to the sleep disorders center to adjust the mask, the air pressure, or the time you use the machine. 2. If you use your CPAP every day, the swelling in your throat will gradually go away. It may take 2 to 6 weeks for this to happen. 3. To make sure that your CPAP is working, you may need to go back to the sleep disorders center for a follow-up visit. This is especially important if you are having side effects or if your CPAP seems to be too strong.","1. Swelling due to sleep apnea is generally due to increased pressure in the blood vessels of the neck. This pressure reduction occurs within a few days of starting CPAP therapy. 2. However, swelling due to fluid accumulation in the tissues also takes a long time to resolve. This is because sleep apnea can lead to congestive heart failure. Fluid accumulation in the legs, ankles, feet, and abdomen is a sign of congestive heart failure. This fluid accumulation will take time to resolve.",1-2 weeks of use are usually necessary for the positive effects of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to become apparent.

"Yes, older infants can get jaundice. Jaundice is a common condition in newborns and is seen in more than half of all newborns. It usually goes away on its own without treatment. However, jaundice can also occur in older infants.  Jaundice occurs when the skin and eyes become yellow. It occurs when the level of bilirubin in the blood is too high. Bilirubin is a yellow substance that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. It normally travels to the intestines where it is changed to brownish color and passes in stool. Sometimes, when too much bilirubin is made, it stays in the blood and causes jaundice.  Jaundice in older infants may occur due to liver problems, certain medications, or infections. It may also occur if the infant has a family history of a liver condition called Gilbert's syndrome.  Jaundice is treated if the bilirubin level is very high or if it is a risk for causing brain damage. Treatment options include phototherapy (light treatment), medication, or a blood transfusion.",6 months,"1. Jaundice in the first week of life is common and usually not serious.

"1. What is Familial Mediterranean Fever? a. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever accompanied by inflammation of the serosal lining of various organs, including the peritoneum (the lining of the abdomen), pleura (the lining of the lungs), and synovial membranes of the joints. b. In most individuals, the first attack of FMF occurs before the age of 20. c. Between attacks, patients usually feel well, although some may have mild joint pain or swelling. d. The frequency of attacks varies greatly even within the same family. Attacks can be triggered by physical exertion, emotional stress, or infection. 2. What causes Familial Mediterranean Fever? a. FMF is a genetic condition inherited from a person's parents. Most individuals with FMF have mutations in one of two genes (MEFV or MARS) that produce proteins (named pyrin and marenostrin, respectively) that are important in controlling inflammation. b. The inflammation seen in FMF results from an abnormal overproduction of a protein called IL-1beta. This protein is part of the body's immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign invaders such as viruses or bacteria. c. The abnormal overproduction of IL-1beta is due to a defective protein called cryopyrin that is produced by the MEFV gene. Cryopyrin is found mainly at sites of inflammation in the body. d. When an inflammatory response occurs, the cryopyrin in the inflamed tissue breaks down, releasing the active form of IL-1beta. The IL-1beta then triggers the release of more inflammatory proteins and causes fever, as well as other symptoms of inflammation. e. The abnormal overproduction of IL-1beta is believed to cause FMF attacks. The symptoms of FMF are due to the inflammatory response that occurs during attacks. 3. How is Familial Mediterranean Fever diagnosed? a. There are two ways in which FMF can be diagnosed: 1) Meeting 2 of 3 criteria established by the International FMF",1.

How can I find out if I have familial Mediterranean fever?,"1. The condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever with serosal, synovial, and/or cutaneous inflammation. 2. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 3. The condition is most commonly found in individuals of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. 4. Men are affected twice as often as women. 5. The condition is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene. 6. There is no cure for familial Mediterranean fever, only to ease symptoms. Treatment usually involves the use of colchicine, although it does not cure the condition. Colchicine helps prevent attacks and reduce the pain and swelling of the attacks. 7. Prophylactic colchicine is effective in preventing amyloidosis in patients with frequent FMF attacks","Familial Mediterranean Fever is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (inflammation of serous membranes such as peritoneum, pleura, and synovial membranes of joints). It is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for this to develop. It is most commonly found in individuals of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. The typical age of onset is between 5-10 years of age. There are several other symptoms that may occur during an episode including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, rash, and joint pain. The episodes generally last 1-3 days and can occur as frequently as once per week, or as infrequently as once every few years. There is no cure for Familial Mediterranean Fever, but medications can help reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks.","1) Familial Mediterranean Fever is also known as amyloidosis, familial amyloidosis, and Mediterranean fever. 2) It is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by repeated episodes of fever and inflammation.  3) The illness is inherited and can affect people of any ethnic background.  4) It can involve multiple organs, including the skin, joints, and nervous system. 5) It results from problems with a protein called pyrin. 6) In some cases, it can lead to amyloidosis, a serious condition in which a substance called amyloid builds up in the body's organs and tissues. 7) In rare cases, it can be life-threatening."

BMS is a diagnosis of exclusion. If you have burning mouth symptoms, it is important to exclude other diseases before making the diagnosis of BMS. 2. The exact cause of burning mouth syndrome is not known. However, it is thought that BMS may be caused by a combination of factors, including: a. Tongue inflammation b. Altered nerve function c. Psychological factors 3. Your doctor will need to exclude other diseases before making the diagnosis of BMS. You may need to see a dentist or specialist (such as an oral surgeon, oral medicine specialist, otolaryngologist, or neurologist). Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of your symptoms for a week or two, including: a. The times you experience burning b. What you ate c. The times you ate or drank something and experienced burning soon after 4. Your doctor may also take a swab from your tongue to check for a fungal infection called candidiasis. 5. You may need to have blood tests to rule out iron-deficiency anemia, diabetes, and other conditions. 6. Treatment for BMS may include: a. Cholinergic medications b. Anticonvulsant medications c. Topical medications 7. If no medical conditions are found, treatment may include: a. Counseling b. Anticonvulsant medications c. Rinses with cholinergic medications d. Vitamin supplements 8. You may want to try an eliminated food trial, which involves keeping a food diary for a week or two, and then eliminating foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. You can then reintroduce the foods, one by one, and note whether your symptoms return. 9. If you have dry mouth, your doctor may recommend: a. Frequent sips of water b. Artificial saliva c. Medications to make saliva more thick and lubricating"
"1. Since you have nodules, I suggest you to go for FNAC of the nodules to see whether they are malignant or not.2. You can go for thyroid hormone profile to see whether the thyroid is producing adequate amount of hormones or not.3. A thyroid scan is required to see whether the nodules are functional or non-functional.4. The treatment depends on the FNAC report, thyroid profile and the scan report. It may be surgical removal of the nodules, radio-iodine ablation of the nodules, or medical treatment with anti-thyroid medications.","1. Alternative options to surgery include radioactive iodine, which destroys some thyroid tissue and reduces the size of the goiter. 2. Other options include drugs that reduce the amount of thyroid hormone produced, such as propylthiouracil or methimazole. 3. In rare cases, a goiter may need to be removed if it's causing severe problems with breathing or swallowing. 4. You can consult an endocrinologist.","1. Nodular goiter is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and develops lumps (nodules). The nodules are usually noncancerous (benign). 2. The cause of nodular goiter is usually an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) that causes the thyroid to enlarge. The overactivity increases the demand for thyroid hormone and causes the thyroid gland to grow larger as it tries to keep up with the demand. 3. Nodular goiter is most often found during an examination of the neck or while obtaining a radiograph. It is rarely associated with symptoms. Rarely, a nodule may become cancerous. A biopsy can determine whether the nodules are cancerous. 4. Most of the time, the treatment for nodular goiter is surgical. The surgeon removes the affected lobe (hemithyroidectomy) or the entire thyroid gland (total thyroidectomy). You will need to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. 5. Nodular goiter is not life-threatening, but it may be a sign of an overactive thyroid gland.","1) Surgery is the best option for treating nodular goiters that are causing problems. But if you are not keen on surgery, then the other options include: Thyroxine hormone therapy - Thyroxine hormone therapy is a treatment option for people with nodular goiters who have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). The therapy involves taking a daily dose of thyroxine, a synthetic version of thyroid hormone. This treatment is usually reserved for people with hypothyroidism who also have goiters. Radioactive iodine therapy - This treatment is used to shrink the thyroid gland in people with nodular goiters. It can also be used to treat an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). Radioactive iodine is a radioactive chemical that is taken up by the thyroid gland and can destroy abnormal thyroid cells. External beam radiation therapy - External beam radiation therapy is another treatment option for people with nodular goiters who have cancerous (malignant) thyroid nodules. The goal of this therapy is to destroy abnormal thyroid cells. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration - This procedure is used to remove samples of cells from thyroid nodules. It may be used to diagnose the cause of a nodule or to remove (aspirate) fluid from a cystic nodule. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration can also be used to inject a sclerosing agent into a nodule to cause it to shrink (sclerotherapy).",1. You can consult Endocrinologist for the same and go through following treatment options:. 2. Treatment is advised if the goiter is causing obstructive symptoms like difficulty in breathing or swallowing or if it is cosmetically unacceptable.3. Goitrogens are used to treat the condition. 4. Radioactive iodine is used to shrink the goiter.5. Surgery is advised if the above-mentioned techniques fail to provide satisfactory results.,"1. The first line of treatment is usually a medication called levothyroxine, which is a synthetic form of thyroxine. It's the hormone your body doesn't make enough of if you have hypothyroidism. You may need to take levothyroxine for life. 2. You'll need to have an ultrasound or CT scan of your neck to check your thyroid gland. If it's very large and is pressing on your windpipe or esophagus, you may need surgery. 3. If your thyroid gland is only slightly enlarged and isn't causing any symptoms, your doctor may recommend just monitoring your thyroid hormone levels and thyroid antibodies. 4. You can consult an endocrinologist for further management."

"1. Medications are often used to treat arrhythmias, including antiarrhythmic drugs and other medications. 2. You may need an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker to treat your arrhythmia. A special kind of pacemaker called a biventricular pacemaker may be used if you have heart failure. 3. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be used to treat certain types of arrhythmias, especially those involving the heart's electrical system (conduction system). 4. Surgery may be used to treat arrhythmias that don't respond to other treatments. In rare cases, a severe arrhythmia can be life-threatening. In these cases, a special procedure called emergency cardioversion may be used to restore a normal heart rhythm.",1. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment used to remove the tissue that is causing an arrhythmia. RFA can be performed as an open surgical procedure or with catheters inserted through blood vessels to the heart. 2. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used to treat patients at risk of sudden death from an arrhythmia. These devices deliver an electric shock when they detect dangerous arrhythmias. They also may be used to correct slow or irregular heart rhythms. 3. Biventricular pacemakers help patients with severe heart failure live longer and improve their quality of life. These devices monitor and treat both the right and left ventricles. They treat heart failure by coordinating the electrical signals that control the heartbeat.,"1) The latest treatment for heart arrhythmia is a class of drugs called beta blockers. Beta blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce the risk of developing arrhythmias. 2) Another new treatment option is called catheter ablation. During this procedure, a doctor uses a thin, flexible tube (catheter) to deliver energy to the areas of the heart that are causing the abnormal heartbeats. 3) Radiofrequency ablation is a procedure that uses heat energy to destroy small areas of heart tissue that are causing the abnormal heartbeats.",1) Beta blockers 2) Calcium channel blockers 3) Digoxin 4) Adenosine 5) Antiarrhythmia drugs 6) Antiarrhythmia devices,"1) One of the most significant advancements in the treatment of heart arrhythmias is the development of catheter ablation.  Catheter ablation is a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted through an artery up to the heart.  Electrical energy (radiofrequency) is delivered through the catheter to destroy the abnormal heart tissue causing the arrhythmia.  The procedure is performed by cardiologists and electrophysiologists.  This procedure has been very successful in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).  While initial results with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) have been promising, long-term follow-up studies are still pending.  Also, catheter ablation has been extremely useful in the treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, a condition in which there is an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart, resulting in episodes of fast heart rate and palpitations. 2) Antiarrhythmic medications are still very important in the treatment of heart arrhythmias.  However, the use of antiarrhythmic medications has diminished due to the concern of serious side effects with these medications.  Some of the significant advancements with antiarrhythmic medications involve the development of drugs that have fewer side effects.  For example, a medication called dofetilide has been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This medication is effective in the treatment of AF and has been shown to have fewer side effects than some of the older antiarrhythmic medications.  Another significant advance in the treatment of AF is the use of anticoagulation (blood thinners) in patients who are being treated with these medications.  Blood thinners are necessary because of the increased risk of stroke in patients with AF. 3) Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers have been significant advancements in the treatment of heart arrhythmias.  These devices are implanted in the chest under the skin and continuously monitor the heart rhythm.  If a life-threatening arrhythmia occurs,","1) Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the treatment of choice for many types of arrhythmias. 2) New catheter designs and computer-generated imaging enable physicians to locate and destroy the precise site of an arrhythmia deep within the heart muscle. 3) Intraoperative mapping of the endocardial surface of the heart has improved the success rate of RFA. 4) RFA is also used to treat some types of tachycardia. 5) Other new approaches to treating arrhythmias include implantable cardioverters and defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and a variety of new antiarrhythmic drugs."
"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA. Lupus is a chronic disease that affects the body's immune system. Normally, the immune system fights infection and disease. But in lupus, the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues. No one knows what causes lupus. But lupus tends to run in families. And some research shows that genetic factors may play a role. Lupus is also linked to certain viruses and to certain medications. Women are more likely to develop lupus than men, and African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely to develop lupus than Caucasians. Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are joint pain or swelling, muscle pain, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, feeling tired, and sensitivity to the sun. There is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or even years to make the diagnosis. There is no cure for lupus, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it. People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You may see a rheumatologist who specializes in lupus, and you may also see a primary care doctor or a specialist in another area. NIH- The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)","Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain. It is often called ""the great imitator"" because its symptoms can be mistaken for many other diseases. Lupus is difficult to diagnose, and there is no single test for it. Instead, doctors put together a range of clinical tests and assessments, including blood counts, urine tests, and X-rays, along with a thorough physical exam. There is no cure for lupus, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it.","Treatment for lupus depends on the symptoms you have and how severe they are. Some people have mild symptoms and do well with little or no treatment. Others may need medicines, including steroids and immunosuppressants.  Immunosuppressants work to damp down your immune system so it doesn't attack healthy tissues.  Most people start treatment when they first have symptoms. Later, they may need treatment again if symptoms reappear.  If you have lupus nephritis, your doctor may prescribe treatment to protect your kidneys. This might include medicines and a low-salt diet.  You should not get live vaccines, including polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). If you have lupus, you should discuss pregnancy with your doctor. Some medicines are safe to take during pregnancy.","1. Medications: Drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment. The following medications are commonly used to treat lupus: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., azathioprine) Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine) Antibiotics, for infections 2. Lifestyle Changes: A healthy lifestyle can help manage your symptoms and reduce your risk for complications. The following lifestyle changes may help relieve some lupus symptoms: Maintain a healthy weight. Regular exercise. Get enough sleep. Take steps to reduce stress. Avoid exposure to the sun. Taking these steps may help prevent flares and reduce damage to your joints, skin, and organs.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but usually attacks the joints, skin, blood vessels and lungs. Lupus also can damage the kidneys and the brain. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, is a chronic disease in which inflammation and damage to the body's organs and tissues occur over time. Another type of lupus is acute cutaneous lupus. This type affects the skin and does not cause damage to the internal organs. Discoid lupus is a third type in which only the skin is affected. Neonatal lupus, which occurs in newborns, is a fourth type. People with lupus are prone to a variety of symptoms. Some common ones are pain and swelling in the joints, rashes on the face or body, sensitivity to the sun, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen glands, and feeling tired. Lupus symptoms vary from person to person and can change over time. Some symptoms are:  Joints - Pain, swelling, or stiffness in joints or surrounding muscles. Joints may be red and/or warm. Hands - Red, painful, swollen, and warm; between the fingers, there may be painful nodules. Fingers - Decreased sensation; ""pins and needles.""

"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Radiation therapy is a method of treating cancer by using high intensity radiation to destroy the cancer cells. It is an effective method of treatment for many types of cancers. Melanoma is one of them. However, radiation therapy is not always successful in treatment of melanoma and depends on the location and extent of disease. If the melanoma has spread from the heel to the leg then it is stage 4 disease. Stage 4 disease has a survival of 5 years in half of the patients treated with radiation therapy. Since the melanoma has spread to the leg, radiation therapy will help control disease progression and reduce pain. It will not affect the trial PMC-LLaMA.  Before radiation therapy, a simulation is done to know the exact area to be treated. Please do not worry.","Radiation therapy may be used to treat melanoma that has spread to lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. Radiation may be administered externally (as X-rays or gamma rays), internally (as radioactive seeds implanted in the tumor), or as a directed external beam. Radiation therapy may result in skin changes, scarring, or loss of fingernails or toenails. It may also cause nausea or vomiting and fatigue. Patients should discuss the risks and benefits of radiation therapy with their treating physician.","1. Yes, radiation therapy can be utilized for melanoma that has progressed from the heel to the leg. 2. The use of radiation therapy would not influence the outcome of experimental medications or alternative treatments. 3. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the use of radiation therapy improves overall survival in melanoma patients. 4. The use of radiation therapy may be considered to help control symptoms from locally progressive disease.","1. The effectiveness of radiation therapy depends on the stage of the disease. In stage IV melanoma, there is no evidence that radiotherapy prolongs life. 2. The main role of radiotherapy is in the palliation of symptoms such as pain from bone metastases or bleeding from superficial lesions.","5-year overall survival was 36% in the RT plus IFN-a arm vs 27% in the IFN-a arm, which was statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the rates of local recurrence, regional lymph node recurrence, or distant metastasis between the two treatment arms.","5-year local control rate for patients with primary melanoma of the extremities is 89%. If the melanoma has migrated up the leg and is no longer confined to the primary site, the prognosis is poorer than for primary disease, due to the increased risk of local and regional failure. The utility of radiation therapy in addressing this issue is that it can improve local control, but has no impact on the development of distant metastases."

"1. Friedreich ataxia is an inherited condition, means it is genetic.2. This is an autosomal recessive condition.3. In this condition, there is expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the Friedreich ataxia gene, which encodes frataxin.4. This expansion results in a deficiency of frataxin, which is required for normal functioning of mitochondria. 5. As a result, organs with the highest energy requirements, such as the heart and the nervous system, are affected.6. Patients present with progressive weakness, ataxia, dysarthria, and loss of vibration and position sensation in the legs.7.

The FDA has designated Ionis-FAST as an orphan product for the treatment of patients with Friedreich ataxia. Orphan designation is given to products intended for the diagnosis/treatment/prevention of a rare disease or condition, for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing it will be recovered from the sales of that drug. 4. Currently, Ionis-FAST is being studied in a phase 2/3 clinical trial (NCT01088081). The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether Ionis-FAST significantly reduces the amount of GAA repeats in the ataxin-1 gene. Secondary outcomes include measures of neurological function. 5. It is difficult to predict when Ionis-FAST will be approved by the FDA, but if the current clinical trial shows that Ionis-FAST is effective in reducing the amount of GAA repeats in the ataxin-1 gene, then it will be considered for approval.","1.

"1) Yes, pacemaker implantation is indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. 2) In addition, pacemaker implantation may be indicated to prevent possible life-threatening tachyarrhythmias which may trigger the vagal bradycardia and subsequent bradyarrhythmias. 3) Pacemakers may also help prevent bradycardia-induced syncope.","1. Yes, it is possible to prevent such spasms by pacemaker implantation. 2. Pacemaker implantation is a good option for patients with symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia associated with recurrent syncope or presyncope caused by a cardiac arrhythmia. 3. The pacemaker will prevent the dangerous bradycardia and tachyarrhythmias. 4. It can also help to reduce the frequency of spasms by controlling the heart rate. 5. In addition, some pacemakers have an advanced function called the rate-adaptive AV delay function, which can help prevent cough syncope.","Pacemakers are used to treat many types of heart conditions. Bradycardia, or slow heartbeat, is one of the most common indications for a pacemaker. If your heart rate becomes too slow, not enough blood is pumped to your body and brain. You may feel very tired and short of breath. In addition, you may lose consciousness or even go into a coma. A pacemaker can correct slow heartbeats caused by a block in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. A pacemaker is a small, batterypowered device that is implanted under the skin. It sends electrical signals to your heart to regulate your heartbeat. Pacemakers can also be used to treat problems with the electrical signals that control the contractions of your heart muscle. These problems, called arrhythmias, can occur in the heart's upper chamber, called the atria, or in its lower chamber, called the ventricles. When an arrhythmia occurs, your heart may beat too fast or too slow. It may beat irregularly, or it may not contract enough to pump blood effectively. Your heartbeat may be normal, but the electrical signals that control your heartbeat may be abnormal. Your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist if he or she suspects that you have a problem with your heartbeat. The cardiologist will perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) to diagnose the problem. If you need a pacemaker, the cardiologist will implant one.","1. Yes, a pacemaker can prevent these spasms from happening.2. The symptoms of the patient are suggestive of vasospastic angina.3. The patient should undergo a coronary angiography to assess the coronary arteries and the need for revascularization.4. The episodes of chest pain and spasms are due to the blockage in the coronary arteries.5. A pacemaker can be used to prevent bradycardia and thus reduce the chances of the vasospasms.","1. Yes, pacemakers can prevent these spasms by controlling the heart rate. 2. The pacemaker can be programmed to increase the heart rate whenever the heart rate slows down too much. The increased heart rate will increase the blood flow through the bladder and prevent the spasms. 3. The pacemaker can also be programmed to prevent the heart rate from decreasing too much. 4. A third option is to simply increase the pacing rate whenever the heart rate slows down too much. 5. In some patients, the pacemaker can also stimulate the nerves to the bladder to prevent the spasms.","1) The symptoms you have described are not typical of the type of arrhythmia that would be prevented by a pacemaker.2) However, if you do have a type of arrhythmia that is being prevented by the pacemaker and you continue to have these types of symptoms, you should contact your doctor and have an evaluation done.3) There are other causes of spasms in the legs and arms that may be unrelated to the heart."

In these cases, the ptosis is generally not severe, and the prognosis for recovery is good. 5. In cases of mild or moderate eyelid ptosis that do not appear to be associated with any underlying disease, the ptosis is usually present for life. 6. Various operations are available to correct the ptosis, but they do not work very well in cases of mild or moderate eyelid ptosis. 7. For this reason, many doctors recommend that patients with mild or moderate eyelid ptosis should be followed by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to make sure that the ptosis is not getting worse. 8.

If this is not possible because the milk allergy is so severe, then desensitization can be attempted. This is done by gradually increasing the amount of milk given until a tolerable amount is reached","Milk allergy is common in childhood, and most people develop tolerance to milk proteins over time. However, milk-free diets can present problems because milk is found in many processed foods. A person with a milk allergy must read labels carefully and contact the manufacturer if unsure about the presence of milk in a product. Doctors may prescribe a medication called diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for emergency treatment of a milk reaction. Allergy shots, which involve receiving monthly injections of small amounts of milk protein, may help reduce reactions to milk.","1. Avoidance of offending allergens is the primary treatment of milk allergy. Milk-free diet is the treatment of choice. However, complete elimination of milk products from the diet is difficult. Milk substitutes like soy milk and rice milk are available. However, many individuals who are allergic to milk are also allergic to soy and/or rice milk. Complete avoidance of milk and milk products is an effective treatment for milk allergy.  2. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is also a treatment option for milk allergy.

"1. The RNY surgery is notorious for causing b12 deficiency.  You must get your b12 levels checked and take supplements if required. 2. You will also need iron supplements. 3. Milk is not the only source of calcium.  You can get calcium from other sources such as green leafy vegetables. 4. You can get your blood tests done to check for absorption of iron and b12. 5. If you are not absorbing adequate amounts of b12 and iron, you will need to take supplements either by injection or oral route.","1. Yes, it can be related to B12 deficiency.2. B12 is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine (terminal ileum).3. After gastric bypass surgery, food does not reach this part of the intestine, so B12 deficiency can occur.4. The same applies to fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, D, E and K).5. You need to take B12 supplements after every 2 months.6. You also need to take a daily multivitamin pill after every day.","1. Yes, B12 deficiency can occur in patients who undergo gastric bypass surgery due to impaired absorption. The deficiency may manifest early or late after surgery. If your anemia is due to B12 deficiency, your MCV will be low and your serum B12 will be low. 2. If your anemia is due to iron deficiency, your MCV will be normal or elevated and your serum iron will be low.","1. Vitamin B-12 deficiency is common in post bariatric surgery patients due to reduced gastric acid production and altered anatomy.2. Serum vitamin B-12 concentration is the preferred method for assessment of vitamin B-12 status.3. In patients with documented deficiency, oral replacement is effective, but parenteral vitamin B-12 is often preferred due to compliance issues.4. In patients with borderline deficiency (e.g., B-12 < 300ng/mL), serum B-12 should be rechecked after several months to confirm the diagnosis prior to initiating supplementation.5. Intrinsic factor (IF) deficiency is a common cause of vitamin B-12 deficiency after bariatric surgery.6. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia can be made by testing for the presence of anti-IF antibodies.","1. Yes, you are correct. The anemia due to iron deficiency after gastric bypass surgery is due to poor absorption of iron in the diet. 2. The lack of intrinsic factor (B12) will also lead to anemia as well. 3. This anemia is known as ""megaloblastic anemia"". 4. You should be on a daily B12 injection, and if the anemia does not resolve, then a daily injection of iron is also required.","1. No, Gastric bypass surgery does not cause B12 deficiency. 2. B12 can be absorbed in the ileum, and so gastric bypass surgery does not affect its absorption. 3. Gastric bypass surgery can cause anemia due to poor absorption of iron and also calcium and vitamin D. 4. B12 deficiency anemia is macrocytic anemia, and it is not related to iron deficiency anemia."
"1. It is important to find out the cause of small testicles.2. The following tests may be done to find out the cause:a. Blood tests: Testosterone, LH, FSH, PRL, prolactin, TSH, calcium, phosphorus, blood sugar, creatinine, liver function tests, lipid profile.b. Ultrasound scrotum.c. Biopsy of testis.3. Treatment will depend upon the cause. Some causes are treatable and testicular size may increase with treatment. Some causes are not treatable and testicular size may not increase. In such cases testicular implants may be put to increase size.","1. It is important to rule out a hydrocele of the scrotum first. A small scrotal mass can have many causes, including a hernia, testicular cancer, and hydrocele of the testicle.2. The first step in evaluating a scrotal mass is a physical examination by a physician. The physician will determine the nature of the mass and whether it is inside or outside the testicle.3. If the mass seems to be a cyst (a fluid-filled sac), it can be aspirated with a needle and syringe. Fluid from the cyst can be sent to a laboratory for analysis. If the mass is solid and not inside the testicle, it can be surgically removed and examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells.4. A smaller, localized hydrocele of the testicle can sometimes be aspirated with a needle and syringe. If the hydrocele is large, the fluid is often reaspirated several times over a period of several months. If the fluid keeps coming back, a surgical procedure called a tunica vaginalis aspiration can be performed.","1. A small testicle may be due to: a. A varicocele. This is a dilation of the veins of the testicle. It can make the testicle larger and feel very heavy. It is more common on the left side.  b. An inguinal hernia. This occurs when a small piece of bowel or fat bulges through a weakness in the groin muscle into the scrotum. It can make the scrotum larger.  c. Hydrocele. This is a collection of fluid in the scrotum. It can make the scrotum larger.  d. Testicular torsion. This occurs when the testicle twists on its axis. It causes severe pain, swelling and can make the testicle smaller. 2. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor for an examination. 3. If you have a condition that makes one testicle smaller than the other, it could be a sign of cancer. Get it checked by a doctor.","1. Testicular atrophy: Testicular atrophy is a condition in which the testicles shrink and become firm. The cause may be unknown in most cases, but it may result from injury or as a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 2. Orchitis: Orchitis is inflammation of the testicle. It may result from a viral or bacterial infection, including mumps or tuberculosis. 3. Testicular failure: If both testicles fail to produce sperm or fail to function properly, the condition is known as testicular failure. Causes may include a genetic disorder, an injury or a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 4. Undescended testicle: An undescended testicle is one that fails to move from the abdomen into the scrotum. It's more common in boys who were born with a slightly feminine appearance, including a small penis, a groin mass, or a hernia. 5. Testicular tumors: Cancer of the testicles is a common form of cancer in young men. The cause is unknown, but certain factors increase the risk, including a family history of the disease, a history of undescended testicle, and a history of testicular cancer in the other testicle.","1. The most common cause of an adult testicle being smaller than the other is a condition called varicocele. This occurs when the veins inside the scrotum become enlarged. 2. The enlarged veins can make the scrotum appear larger and feel softer than the other side. Varicocele is more common in adults than in children. It usually affects one testicle more than the other. 3. Other conditions that can cause the testicle to appear smaller include infection, injury, and tumors. 4. Infections are usually painful. Injury often causes pain and swelling. Tumors might not cause symptoms right away, but they can cause pain and swelling later. 5. If you have one testicle that appears smaller than the other, you should see a health care provider. They will examine you and may order imaging tests to find out what's wrong. 6. The treatment depends on the cause. For example, varicocele might be treated with a surgical procedure called ligation. If a tumor is found, you might need surgery to remove it.","1. Unevenly sized testicles may indicate a condition called testicular torsion, which requires immediate medical attention. 2. Testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle twists on its axis and the blood supply is cut off. 3. Symptoms include sudden pain in the groin or the side of the abdomen, swelling and tenderness in the scrotum, and dizziness or nausea. 4. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency; if untreated, it can lead to testicular loss and infertility."
"1. High Vitamin D levels can be due to either increased production in the skin from exposure to sunlight or increased absorption from the intestines. Production in the skin is affected by the amount of direct sunlight exposure and the intensity of the sun's rays at any given time of day. Absorption from the intestines is affected by the amount of vitamin D consumed in food and the body's ability to absorb the vitamin. 2. If your sister was deficient in vitamin D at the time of diagnosis, she may have been prescribed supplements. If she was found to be deficient after treatment, she would have been prescribed supplements. If her levels are high, then she may need to be tested for parathyroid adenomas. 3. The parathyroid glands are small, pea-sized glands located behind the thyroid gland. They control the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream and the absorption of calcium from food in the intestines. 4. Increased levels of vitamin D may be due to excess release of calcium from the bones, which can occur if the parathyroid glands are overactive.","1. Yes, high levels of vitamin D could be due to excessive secretion of vitamin D from the parathyroid gland (secondary hyperparathyroidism) or from the kidney (renal secondary hyperparathyroidism) or excessive ingestion of vitamin D as a dietary supplement. 2. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is often associated with chronic renal failure and tetany (not seen in your case). 3. Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism is due to hypocalcemia caused by renal loss of calcium. 4. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition in which a mutation in the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor results in low urinary calcium excretion. The mutation causes decreased sensing of serum calcium levels by the receptor, leading to increased PTH secretion. 5. Other rare causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include inactivating mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor causing Blomstrand's chondrodysplasia and receptor-mediated familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia. 6. Increase of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be due to excessive ingestion of vitamin D as a dietary supplement.","1. It is unlikely that high vitamin D levels can affect the pituitary gland directly. 2. However, there are indirect effects of high vitamin D levels. For example, it has been shown that vitamin D can affect calcium metabolism and this may indirectly affect the pituitary gland leading to increased secretion of pituitary hormones. 3. In addition, if high vitamin D levels cause increased release of calcium from the bones, this can indirectly affect the pituitary gland. 4. It is possible that the high vitamin D levels and the pituitary gland problem are linked indirectly. 5. Further research is needed in this area.","1. Yes, it is possible. 2. It is not common. 3. It is not likely. 4. The most common cause of high vitamin D levels is the overuse of supplements. 5. Other causes include chronic kidney disease, Cushing's syndrome, sarcoidosis, and excessive exposure to sunlight. 6. It is not clear why some patients with thyroid cancer and breast cancer have high vitamin D levels. 7. In general, high vitamin D levels should be investigated in detail only if there is a reason to suspect that it may be due to one of the above conditions. 8. It is rare for high vitamin D levels to be due to increased production from the pituitary or anywhere else in the body.","Dear, Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin. It can be synthesized in our body when sunlight falls on our skin and also obtained from the diet.  It helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the gut and helps in their utilization in the body.  It also helps in the growth and development of bone and teeth.  High level of it causes increased calcium absorption which results in hypercalcemia.  The symptoms of hypercalcemia include weakness, fatigue, constipation, increased thirst and urination, muscle aches and cramps, and kidney stones.  Also, there is increased chance of developing heart diseases. High level of it is seen in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and malignancies.  It is also associated with increased risk of falling.  It is not associated with pituitary gland function. So, your sister should be evaluated for the cause of increased vitamin D level. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care PMC-LLaMA.","1. High vitamin D levels are not related to the pituitary gland. 2. The answer to your question would depend on what treatments your sister received for her thyroid and breast cancer. 3. The answer would also depend on what medications your sister is taking. 4.

Since you have been trying since 7 years, I would recommend that you get a tubal patency test done as well.","1. You may have a condition called unexplained infertility. This is when you and your partner have been trying to conceive for over 1 year without success. 2. Other conditions that could cause infertility include pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and uterine fibroids. 3. One possible reason you may not have become pregnant is that you may have a cervical factor. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. You may have a condition called cervical factor infertility. This means that the cervix may not allow the sperm to enter the uterus and fertilize the egg. 4. Another possible reason you may not have become pregnant is that you may have a uterine factor. The uterus is the place where the fertilized egg implants and grows into a baby. You may have a condition called uterine factor infertility. This means that the lining of the uterus may not provide the right environment for the fertilized egg to implant and grow. 5. You should see a reproductive endocrinologist to evaluate the reason for your infertility.","1. It is possible that your boyfriend has a low sperm count, or low motility, or abnormal sperm. 2.

Do not worry, get the TFT done and if normal, go for surgery.","1. Yes, weight reduction surgery is an option for people with morbid obesity. 2. The procedure is called gastric banding. The band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to create a small pouch which fills quickly. The pouch is connected to the rest of the stomach by a narrow opening. Food moves slowly from the pouch to the rest of the stomach and then into the intestine. 3. The band restricts the amount of food that can be eaten at one time and also the rate at which food moves through the stomach. This causes a feeling of fullness and slows down digestion. 4. The band is adjusted by the surgeon to suit each patient's needs. A balloon is used to adjust the band. The balloon is connected to the band by a thin tube. 5. Patients can adjust the band themselves by injecting saline into the balloon. The amount of fluid in the balloon is decreased to increase the amount of food that can be eaten. The amount of fluid in the balloon is increased to create a feeling of fullness and reduce the amount of food that can be eaten. 6. The most common side effect is slippage of the band. 7. The surgery is reversible.","1. The first line of treatment is diet and fluid restriction. 2. In case of failure of diet and fluid restriction, the next step is to use diuretics (water pills), which can be oral or injectables. 3.

"100 mg to 150 mg per day. Again, the dosage is individualized, and some patients may need as much as 300 mg per day. If a patient has been taking morphine for years (10)for pain relief, and is exhibiting the flu-like inability to think or communicate, as a loving friend, could you guess/estimate for me how long the hell they're experiencing may last? It may last for 1 week.","1000 mg of morphine a day for ten years is equivalent to 365,000 mg of morphine taken in a year. This is 3.65 kg of morphine taken in a year. The lethal dose of morphine is about 1000 mg, or 10 mg/kg. So the person in question is taking about three times the lethal dose of morphine for a year. This is equivalent to taking 3000 mg of morphine daily for a year. The elimination half-life of morphine is about 2.5 hours. So if the person is taking morphine at a rate of 3000 mg daily, then he is taking 3000 mg x 2.5 hr = 7500 mg/day, which is equivalent to 7500 mg/day x 365 days/year = 262,500 mg/year. This is equivalent to taking 262.5 kg of morphine in one year. Since the person in question is taking morphine for ten years, he has taken a total of 262,500 mg x 10 years = 2,625,000 mg. This is equivalent to taking 2,625 kg of morphine in ten years. If we divide 2,625 kg of morphine by 365 days/year, we get 7.16 kg of morphine per day. This is equivalent to taking 7.16 mg/kg of morphine per day. Since the lethal dose of morphine is 10 mg/kg, then the person in question is taking a dose of morphine that is 0.716 mg/kg, which means he is taking a dose that is only 7.16% of the lethal dose. So it is highly unlikely that the person in question will die from morphine overdose. Since the person in question is only showing flu-like symptoms that affect his ability to think or communicate, it is highly unlikely that he will die from morphine overdose. We are left to conclude that the person in question is showing flu-like symptoms that affect his ability","10 years is a long time to be taking morphine for pain management, and it is a good idea to consider tapering off the medication under the guidance of a trained medical professional. The length of time someone suffers from the debilitating effects of morphine use can vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of morphine used and the individual's metabolism. In general, morphine is metabolized by the liver and is excreted by the kidneys. Someone who has been taking morphine for pain management for 10 years is likely to have developed a tolerance to the drug, and the dosage may need to be adjusted. Taking higher doses of morphine for a long period of time can result in dependence, which can make it difficult to stop taking the drug. The length of time someone suffers from the debilitating effects of morphine use can also depend on how quickly they stop taking the drug. If someone has become dependent on morphine after taking it for a long period of time, they may experience withdrawal symptoms. These can include restlessness, anxiety, muscle aches, and sweating. Withdrawal symptoms can last for several weeks or even longer and can be very uncomfortable.","1. It depends on the cause of the symptoms. In case of morphine overdose, it may last for several hours. 2. In case of morphine with PMC-LLaMA. 3. In case of morphine with","1. Chronic morphine use can lead to cognitive impairment and communication difficulties. 2. The duration of these symptoms may vary depending on the extent of the user's morphine addiction. 3. The symptoms may appear more pronounced if the user is under stress or has been using the morphine for a long period of time. 4. The symptoms may also be exacerbated if the user suddenly stops using the morphine, as the body will go into withdrawal. 5. In the case of the flu-like symptoms, the cognitive impairment and communication difficulties may last for a few days to a week, depending on the severity of the symptoms.","1. The symptoms of opiate withdrawal are similar to that of a bad flu. Withdrawal symptoms include: runny nose, sneezing, yawning, sore throat, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, chills, sweating, hot and cold flashes, muscle aches, dilated pupils, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, watering eyes, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. These symptoms usually peak in 7-10 days and resolve in 14 days. 2. The duration of symptoms can vary based on the half-life of the opiate being used. If the half-life is short, the symptoms will subside in less than a week. If the half-life is long, the symptoms will persist for a longer period of time. 3. In general, the symptoms of opiate withdrawal are self-limiting and will resolve within 1-2 weeks."

"1. first thing to do is to meet a doctor and get her genes tested for any genetic mutation. 2. if it's positive then your husband is also at risk of getting the same disease.3. Ask him to quit smoking if he does smoke, and avoid exposure to passive smoke as well.4. Get his lungs checked every 6 months with a chest X-ray and compare it with previous one.5. Avoid exposure to dust, smoke, pollution as much as possible.","Cancer can be inherited, but most cases are not. About 5-10% of lung cancers are inherited. This means that they are caused by abnormal genes passed from parent to child. These genetic abnormalities may increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including lung cancer. Abnormal genes can be detected by a genetic test. Your mother-in-law may have the same abnormal gene as her relatives. However, it is important to know that not all family members who inherit the abnormal gene will develop cancer.","It can be done. It would be worthwhile to test lung cancer patients in your family. However, you should know that it is not only about the genes. Lung cancer is also caused by environmental factors such as smoking or exposure to certain chemicals. So, it is still possible to get lung cancer even if you have genetic testing and no genetic mutation is found.","1. Yes, it will definitely help to know about the genetic risk of lung cancer in your husband and his sisters. 2. The main test that you should go for is called as 'Genetic testing for BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations'. 3. These two genes are called as 'tumor suppressor' genes as their normal function is to prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells. 4. When mutations occur in these genes, they lose their normal function and allow the uncontrolled cell growth to occur, which can result in cancer. 5. If you test positive for these mutations, then there is a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. 6. These tests are highly accurate, but the results may be inconclusive in some cases. 7. For example, if no mutation is detected, but there is a strong family history of breast cancer, it is still possible that an undetected mutation exists. 8. This is why genetic testing is done in specialized centers, where counseling and support are available.","Your husband and his sisters should talk with a geneticist or a doctor who specializes in cancer genetics. The doctor can review the family history and determine whether there could be a genetic component to the cancer. The doctor may suggest that your husband and his sisters have genetic testing. The test can look for specific gene changes that might be causing the cancer. If the test shows a gene change, the doctor will discuss the implications and possible effects with your husband and his sisters.","Your mother-in-law should consider having genetic testing to see if she carries a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. If she tests positive, her children (including your husband and his sisters) may wish to consider testing to see if they inherited the mutation. If they have the mutation, they have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and should have close surveillance or preventive measures."

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) enables the visualization of lesions smaller than 5 mm and has a sensitivity of 95% for the detection of liver metastases, although it may miss lesions smaller than 2 cm. 3. Computed tomography (CT) scan is also a valuable investigation. It is more sensitive than ultrasound, enabling the detection of smaller lesions, and is often used to confirm the presence of lesions detected on ultrasound. 4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is less commonly used than CT scan but may be useful in certain circumstances, particularly if the patient has a contraindication to the use of iodinated contrast medium. 5. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging technique that can detect lesions that are difficult to identify on other imaging investigations. It may be used to identify metastases that are too small to be detected on other imaging investigations or to identify lesions in patients with a rise in the serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) but no lesions on ultrasound or CT scan. 6.

"1. CAT scan - is a non invasive alternative for MRI. It is less expensive and gives an idea about the bleeds in the brain. It will not tell about the small bleeds and does not give the same amount of information that an MRI or a CT scan does. 2. Ultrasound - is a non-invasive alternative for MRI. It is cheap and does not use any radiation. However, it will not give the detailed information that an MRI will give. 3. EEG - can be used to detect the electrical activity in the brain. It can be done along with an MRI to get a better picture of the brain. 4. PET scan - uses glucose which is tagged with a radioactive isotope and injected into the body. It is taken up by the brain cells and the images are taken using a gamma camera. It is expensive and uses radiation. 5. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan - uses a radioactive substance injected into the body. The substance gets taken up by the brain cells and the images are taken using a gamma camera. It is expensive and uses radiation. 6. Echoencephalogram (ECHO) - is an ultrasound of the brain. It is cheap and does not use any radiation. However, it will not give the detailed information that an MRI will give.","1) For patients with contraindications to MRI or CT, ultrasound may be a useful alternative. 2) Functional MRI (fMRI) is an emerging non-invasive neuroimaging modality that has been proposed to assess brain function in a number of different neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that fMRI may have a future role in the evaluation of brain injury, particularly for patients who are unable to undergo standard MRI or CT. 3) Neuropsychological testing can be useful for the assessment of cognitive function after head injury.","1. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain can be used to investigate the metabolite profile of a tumor, which may allow more accurate characterization of a lesion than conventional MRI. 2. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissue. DWI has high sensitivity for the detection of brain lesions, and is more specific than conventional MRI for differentiating benign from malignant brain lesions. 3. Functional MRI (fMRI) measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. While fMRI is primarily used to study brain function in healthy individuals, it may also have a role in the assessment of brain tumors. 4. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning measures metabolic activity in the brain, and can be used to investigate the metabolism of tumors. PET scanning is most useful in the evaluation of tumors that exhibit high metabolic activity, such as gliomas. 5. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measures the distribution of a radioactive tracer in the brain. While SPECT is primarily used to investigate blood flow and metabolism in the brain, it may also have a role in the assessment of brain tumors.",1. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is an alternative imaging method for some types of non-invasive brain imaging. It is a useful tool for diagnosing subdural hematomas and some types of tumors. 2. Functional MRI: Functional MRI uses MRI to measure the oxygen use by different areas of the brain. It can show which areas of the brain are active during different mental and physical tasks. This helps to pinpoint the cause of physical or mental problems. 3. CT angiography: CT angiography is a non-invasive way of looking at the blood vessels in the brain. It uses a CT scanner to take detailed pictures of the brain's blood vessels. 4. Positron emission tomography: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans show how the different areas of the brain are working. This can help to find the area of the brain that is causing a problem. 5. Single-photon emission computed tomography: SPECT scans show how blood flows to the different areas of the brain. It can help to find the area of the brain that is causing a problem.,"1. Electroencephalography (EEG) - EEG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain. EEG is often used to evaluate patients with seizure disorders, and can be used to identify areas of the brain that have abnormal electrical activity. 2. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - MEG is another test that measures the electrical activity of the brain, but does so by measuring the magnetic fields that are generated by this electrical activity. MEG is somewhat more sensitive than EEG in detecting certain types of abnormalities, especially those located in deeper structures within the brain. 3. Evoked potential (EP) studies - EP studies are used to assess the integrity of specific pathways in the brain. For example, visual evoked potential (VEP) studies are used to assess the function of the optic nerves and the visual cortex in the occipital lobes of the brain. Similarly, brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) studies are used to assess the function of the cochlea and auditory nerve, and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) studies are used to assess the function of the peripheral sensory system and the posterior columns of the spinal cord. 4. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound - Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is used to assess blood flow velocities in the major arteries of the brain. It can be useful in identifying patients who have abnormal intracranial blood flow, such as those with stroke. 5. Positron emission tomography (PET) - PET scanning is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that is used to assess metabolic activity in the brain.

It is a medical emergency and needs immediate attention. 5. Patient should be transferred to a neurology center where intravenous thrombolysis can be started. 6. In rare cases, recovery may occur.","1. What is locked-in syndrome?  Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neuropsychological disorder that is characterized by a complete inability to move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis, while remaining conscious and aware of one's surroundings. 2. How is it diagnosed?  Physicians must evaluate patients for the locked-in syndrome and distinguish it from other disorders that produce quadriplegia and mutism. The following conditions may resemble the locked-in syndrome: Pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy, severe cerebellar disorders, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and catatonia. 3. What causes it?  The cause of the locked-in syndrome is usually a small infarct (area of necrosis or tissue death due to lack of blood flow) in the ventral (front) pons, a structure in the brainstem that connects to the cerebellum. This area of the brain is responsible for controlling eye movements and vocalizations. The syndrome is usually caused by a blockage or narrowing of the basilar artery, a vessel that supplies blood to the brainstem. 4. How is it treated?  There is no cure for the locked-in syndrome, although the prognosis is better if treatment is begun soon after symptoms appear. Physical therapy may be used to help the patient perform everyday activities. Speech therapy and eye movement exercises also may be used.","1) Locked-in syndrome is a rare neuropsychological disorder, characterized by a complete inability to move or communicate verbally, while remaining conscious. This condition is often confused with coma or dementia. 2) It occurs as a result of damage to specific areas of the brain, such as the pons, which controls eye movements, and the ventral pons, which controls facial expressions. 3) Locked-in syndrome is also known as cerebromedullospinal disconnection, pseudocoma, or de-efferented state. 4) Locked-in syndrome is not a form of dementia, although it can be mistaken for it. In this condition, the patient's mental faculties remain intact, and he/she is fully aware of his/her surroundings. 5) Patients with this disorder are fully alert and awake, and they often suffer from emotional distress because they are unable to communicate with others. 6) Locked-in syndrome is caused by a lesion (injury to the brain) in the ventral pons and the basal ganglia, usually as a result of a stroke, or a gunshot wound to the brain. 7) It may also result from a disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis (MS), or Guillain-Barre syndrome. 8) Treatment: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are often recommended to help the patient function as much as possible."
1. The probability of one having both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome is quite high as they both are known to be associated with each other. 2. There is no evidence that indicates that the head and neck tics of Tourette Syndrome may be a cause of hydrocephalus.,"1) You developed Tourette's syndrome at the age of 43. 2) At the age of 72, you underwent an unspecified medical procedure for hydrocephalus. There is no direct connection between the two conditions. However, tics can be stressful and can lead to anxiety. This is turn can lead to high blood pressure which can put pressure on the brain and cause the symptoms of hydrocephalus. It is likely that your tics are not directly causing the hydrocephalus, but they may be contributing to the condition.","1. Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics.  It is associated with other conditions such as Attention Deficit Disorder and OCD.  In addition, some patients with TS experience problems with their bladder and bowels, difficulties concentrating, and obsessive thoughts and worries. 2. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the fluid inside the brain is not able to flow properly.  This causes the fluid to build up in the brain, leading to pressure on structures within the brain.  Symptoms of hydrocephalus include headache, problems with balance or walking, seizures, and mental deterioration. 3. TS has not been known to directly cause Hydrocephalus.  However, the presence of a shunt implanted to treat Hydrocephalus can cause tics as a side effect. 4. There is no research that suggests that TS caused your Hydrocephalus.  The shunt implanted to treat your Hydrocephalus can cause tics as a side effect.","1. The most common cause of hydrocephalus is blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the ventricular system. This blockage can occur because of an abnormality of one or more of the four ventricular outflow channels--the two lateral ventricular outflow foramina (foramina of Luschka) and the two fouh ventricular outflow foramina (foramina of Magendie and Becker)--or because of an obstruction within the cisterna magna. 2. The likelihood of an individual developing both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome is entirely dependent upon the etiology of the hydrocephalus. If the cause of the hydrocephalus is an abnormality of the ventricular outflow channels or the cisterna magna, then the likelihood of the two conditions coexisting is low. If, however, the hydrocephalus is the result of a different disorder, then the likelihood of the two conditions coexisting is much higher. 3. Tics are not a factor in the development of hydrocephalus.","Tourette syndrome (also called Tourette's syndrome, Tourette's disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, GTS, or, more commonly, simply Tourette's or TS) is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic.  Average onset between the ages of 3 and 9 years. Males are affected about three to four times more often than females. Common associations are ADHD and OCD.  About 50% of individuals with TS experience an improvement or complete resolution of symptoms by late adolescence or adulthood. In rare cases, tics can disappear but then reemerge in later adulthood.  Hydrocephalus: An accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain that results in an abnormal dilation of the ventricles. The disorder can be caused by an overproduction of CSF, by obstruction of CSF flow, by deficient absorption of CSF, or by a combination of these factors. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the disorder and may include surgery, medication, or both.  Although the symptoms of TS and hydrocephalus are very different, there is some evidence that suggests a possible biological link between the two.  In a study published in the Journal of Child Neurology (1999, volume 14, pages 273-276), researchers found that 43 percent of children with TS also had some degree of hydrocephalus. This is significantly higher than the estimated incidence of hydrocephalus in the general population.  The researchers concluded that this association may support the notion that TS and hydrocephalus may share a common biological mechanism. More research is needed to further understand this possible connection.",1. The probability of having both conditions is very low. 2. Head and neck tics associated with Tourette syndrome are unlikely to be a contributing factor to the development of hydrocephalus.

"1. The treatment of small cell lung cancer depends on the stage of the disease. In general, people with earlier stage disease (stage I and II) are more likely to be cured than those with later stage disease (stage III and IV). 2. Treatment of small cell lung cancer usually involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Newer targeted agents, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are also being used in the treatment of this disease. 3. The most common chemotherapy regimen used to treat small cell lung cancer includes the drugs etoposide, cisplatin, and vinblastine. Other combinations may be used as well. Radiation is given as a short course of treatment for those with localized disease, or as a palliative treatment for those with advanced disease. 4. Targeted agents like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib) are used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for advanced disease. In patients who have relapsed after chemotherapy, other drugs like docetaxel, paclitaxel and gemcitabine may be tried. 5. New drugs like vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib are being used for specific genetic mutations in NSCLC. These are called ""targeted therapies"". They are only given to people whose tumors have specific genetic changes or mutations. 6. People with advanced small cell lung cancer may also receive treatment with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) to prevent the development of brain metastases.","1. Certain targeted therapies such as Gefitinib, Erlotinib, etc. are now being used as first line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 2. The use of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors such as Sorafenib has shown promising results in few cases. 3. The chances of survival have improved with new anti-cancer drugs like Almita Pemetrexed. 4. Newer techniques such as Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) are being tried for treating small tumors. 5. Minimally invasive surgical techniques such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic surgery are now being used widely. 6. Radiation therapy is being used more effectively with new techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT).",1. The latest advancements in treating lung cancer are the use of targeted therapies like Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). 2. Almita is a type of medicine called an antifolate. It works by blocking a certain enzyme in cancer cells that may help to prevent cancer cells from growing. 3. It is used in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the lungs and chest) and non-small cell lung cancer. 4. Targeted therapies are the latest advances in treating lung cancer.,"1. The treatment of lung cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. 2. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Sometimes, more than one kind of treatment is used. 3. For NSCLC, the choice of treatment depends on whether the cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma or an adenocarcinoma. 4. Squamous cell carcinoma is usually treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Adenocarcinoma is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. 5. Chemotherapy is the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells. Cytotoxic chemotherapy kills cancer cells. Targeted therapy uses drugs that interfere with specific molecules in cancer cells. It may also affect normal cells, but it is less harmful to normal cells than cytotoxic chemotherapy. 6. The choice of chemotherapy drug depends on the type of lung cancer. 7. If the cancer has spread to another part of the body, then chemotherapy may be given. The choice of drug depends on the location of the cancer. 8. Other factors that affect the choice of chemotherapy include: 9. How advanced the cancer is (stage) 10. The patient’s general health 11. The patient’s preferences and opinions 12. The potential side effects of the chemotherapy 13. The possibility of combining chemotherapy with other treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy 14. Whether the chemotherapy is given with other drugs. 15. The goal of treatment may be to cure the cancer, to control it, or to relieve symptoms. If the goal is to cure the cancer, the choice of chemotherapy depends on the type and stage of the cancer. If the cancer is localized (not spread out), surgery and radiation therapy may be used. Chemotherapy may be used before or after surgery or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy before surgery or radiation therapy is called neoadjuvant therapy. It aims to reduce the size or extent of the cancer so that the surgery or radiation therapy is easier to perform and is more likely to cure the cancer. Chemotherapy after surgery","There are several new developments in lung cancer treatment that could benefit your friend's wife.  The most important recent advance is a new class of drugs called EGFR inhibitors.  These drugs, including erlotinib and gefitinib, block the growth of lung cancer cells by interfering with a specific protein (called the epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR) on the surface of lung cancer cells.  EGFR inhibitors are approved for use in patients whose lung cancer has spread or come back after surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.  An additional new development in lung cancer treatment is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, such as imatinib or sunitinib.  These drugs, which are also called targeted therapy drugs, block specific proteins inside cancer cells that promote their growth and survival.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are approved for use in patients whose lung cancer has spread or come back after surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.  Another recent advance in lung cancer treatment is the use of a type of monoclonal antibody called bevacizumab (Avastin).  This drug, approved for use with a type of chemotherapy called paclitaxel, blocks a protein called VEGF, which helps new blood vessels form in cancer cells.  Bevacizumab is approved for use in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","A new type of drug therapy, called targeted therapy, is being studied. This type of therapy targets certain parts of cancer cells. Researchers are studying targeted therapies to find new ways to treat lung cancer."

"1. Dizziness and imbalance are the most common symptoms that may be helped by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.2. The ear is not a major site of gas use in the body, but the inner ear is sensitive to changes in pressure.3. When pressure changes suddenly, as in diving, flying, or compression in the ear canal (by blowing or swimming), gas in the inner ear is displaced and dizziness and loss of balance result.4. The symptoms of Meniere's disease are thought to be caused by excessive fluid retention in the inner ear.5. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be helpful in treating the condition, as the increased pressure may shrink the excess tissue and reduce fluid retention.","1. Meniere's disease is a disorder that affects the inner ear. 2. The goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to reduce the swelling of the inner ear that causes dizziness and other symptoms of Meniere's disease. 3. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves placing the person in a chamber that delivers pure oxygen. The person breathes this oxygen while the pressure in the chamber is changed to greater than normal atmospheric pressure. 4. The increased pressure causes more oxygen to be forced into the tissues of the body. This increased oxygen flow is believed to reduce swelling and promote healing. 5. The increased oxygen also may help reduce the formation of free radicals that can cause damage to the inner ear. 6. Some studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce the frequency of attacks and severity of symptoms in patients with Meniere's disease. However, more research is needed to understand how this therapy works and whether it is an effective treatment for Meniere's disease. 7. The National Institutes of Health recommends that patients consider hyperbaric oxygen therapy only if medicines and diet and water restrictions do not help enough.",1. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of idiopathic Meniere's disease. 2. A total of 70 patients with a mean age of 41.7 years (range 22-64 years) and a mean duration of illness of 7.5 years (range 1 month to 20 years) were included in the study. 3. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen treatments (2 sessions per week for 2 months) either as a monotherapy or combined with intratympanic gentamicin. 4. The treatment protocol was well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported. 5. Statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in the dizziness score of the control group compared to the beginning of the treatment (p < 0.001). 6. The dizziness score of the patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen monotherapy was significantly better compared to the patients receiving combined treatment (p < 0.05). 7. The results of our study suggest that adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy is effective in the treatment of idiopathic Meniere's disease.,"1. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear where the balance mechanism is affected. 2. Inner ear disorders are not treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. 3. The treatment options for Meniere's disease include diet and fluid therapy, medications, injection of a chemical around the nerve, surgery, and rehabilitation.","1 = I do not know; 2 = I know, but I do not know the outcome.","1. Meniere's disease is the idiopathic syndrome of fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and aural fullness. It affects 10-15 per 1000 people and has a prevalence of 0.5-1% in general practice. 2. The pathophysiology is poorly understood. Current evidence indicates that the condition is due to raised intracranial pressure, which is transmitted to the labyrinth via the cochlear aqueduct. 3. In addition to symptomatic treatment, several surgical procedures have been devised, all of which aim to reduce the intracranial pressure. These include the placement of a lumbar peritoneal shunt, coicostomy, and endolymphatic sac decompression. 4. These procedures have been associated with significant complications and variable success rates. 5. Another approach is to reduce the pressure in the external auditory canal and thus in the labyrinth by compressing the jugular veins. The pressure differential between the outside and inside of the labyrinth then reduces, which should theoretically help to relieve symptoms. 6. The first description of the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of Meniere's disease was by Turner in 1961. Since then, several studies have been reported, which have included patients with either unilateral or bilateral symptoms and with a varying degree of disability. 7. The treatment consists of a compression/decompression schedule, with the patient breathing 100% oxygen at pressures between 1.3 atmospheres absolute (ata) and 1.7 ata. The treatment is given in a monoplace (single-person) chamber and is administered on an out-patient basis. 8. The decompression period is particularly important. During this time, the differential pressure between the inside and outside of the labyrinth is at its maximum, and this is when the benefit of the treatment is thought to be achieved. The total treatment time is 70 min and the treatment is given twice a week for 3-4 weeks. 9. A number of different studies have been reported, all of which have shown a significant improvement in both the symptomatology and the hearing level. 10"
"1. Since your child is just 4 years old, I suggest you to go ahead with hearing aid trial first for 6 months. If your child responds to hearing aid then go for cochlear implant. 2. If your child does not respond to hearing aid then go for cochlear implant directly.3. You can also recheck your children hearing levels and if they are still significantly low then go for cochlear implant directly.4. Cochlear implant is very effective in child PMC-LLaMA. 5. You need to consult a good cochlear implant center and take their opinion.6. You can also take opinion of another ENT specialist who has more experience in cochlear implant.","1. Yes, if your child has been diagnosed with severe to profound hearing loss in both ears, then cochlear implantation is an option to be considered for your child. 2. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that is surgically implanted under the skin and can provide auditory stimulation to the auditory nerve. 3. Cochlear implantation is an approved treatment for children with severe to profound hearing loss. 4. Prior to cochlear implantation, the child should receive appropriate habilitation, that is, amplification with hearing aids. 5. The child must also have a functioning auditory nerve, which is evaluated with a brainstem auditory evoked response (BERA) test prior to cochlear implantation. 6. If your child does not meet the criteria for cochlear implantation, other options for auditory stimulation include bone-anchored hearing aids and electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.","1. Since your child has been diagnosed with bilateral severe hearing loss, hearing aids will not help. 2. Cochlear implants are used to stimulate the auditory nerve fibers directly thereby bypassing the non-functional transducer system of the inner ear. 3. The main advantage of cochlear implant is that it allows the child to hear speech and develop oral language skills. 4. Co-chlear implantation is done at an early age because the brain has more plasticity and is more receptive to language stimulation. 5. The earlier the child is implanted, the better the outcomes.","1) If the doctor suggests a cochlear implant, it means that it will be beneficial for your child.2) The implant is an electronic device that is surgically implanted under the skin behind the ear. It is used to send sound signals from the external hearing aid to the brain.3) The implant allows your child to hear and understand speech.4) Your child will need to work with a speech-language pathologist to learn how to use the implant and to practice speech and language skills.","1. The cochlear implant is a device that is surgically implanted in the inner ear to help provide sound signals to the brain. It does not restore normal hearing, but can help provide useful hearing to eligible candidates. 2. Children as young as 12 months of age may be candidates for this procedure. 3. The surgery involves placing a small implant into the inner ear. The implant is a receiver which picks up sound signals, which are then sent to the brain via an implanted wire. 4. Cochlear implants may help children hear speech and other sounds, and improve their ability to speak.","1) Cochlear implants are designed to bypass the damaged cochlea and stimulate the auditory nerve directly. 2) The implant electrodes are surgically placed in the inner ear (cochlea) and the external parts include a microphone, a speech processor, and a transmitting coil. 3) Cochlear implants can provide a critical link between child and the spoken/aural language. 4) The implant allows the child to hear speech and other sounds, which will then allow him/her to develop better language skills. 5) A child as young as 12 months can be a candidate for cochlear implant. 6) The implant doesn't restore normal hearing but helps the child to hear well enough to develop oral language skills."
"1. Abnormal communication between the right and left hemispheres of the brain called as cerebral hemispheres. 2. This condition is known as strabismus or squint. 3. In this condition, the affected eye turns in, out, up or down. 4. If the condition is not treated at an early age, it leads to lazy eye or amblyopia. 5. In this condition, the brain develops two separate images from each eye, instead of one image from both eyes. 6. This results in poor vision and the brain suppresses one of the eyes to avoid double vision. 7. The suppressed eye becomes weak due to disuse. 8. The affected eye needs to be patched to force the brain to use the eye. 9. This will strengthen the eye and prevent amblyopia. 10. Adult stem cell research therapy will help to retrain the brain so that the eye will become stronger.","1. What is strabismus? Strabismus is a condition where the eyes are not properly aligned and point in different directions. One eye turns in, out, up, or down while the other eye looks straight ahead. This can happen because the eye muscles are weak or too tight. It can also happen because the brain is sending mixed signals to the eye muscles. The brain tells the eyes to focus on different objects at the same time. When this happens, the eyes are not pointed in the same direction. A child with strabismus may cross his/her eyes or squint. They may also tilt their head to one side to help them see better. Strabismus can be a problem in adults too. It can affect vision and cause headaches and other problems. 2. What causes strabismus in adults? Strabismus in adults may be caused by conditions such as cataracts, diabetes, stroke or other brain disorders, and eye injuries. It may also be caused by problems with the bones of the eyes or with the nerves that control eye muscles. Sometimes, the cause of strabismus in adults cannot be found. 3. How is strabismus treated in adults? Treatment for strabismus in adults may include: Glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems that cause eye strain Eye exercises, patching, or prism lenses to improve vision and prevent the eyes from crossing Vision therapy, which uses exercises to retrain the brain to control the eyes' movements Eye muscle surgery to correct the eye muscle imbalance that causes strabismus 4. What is the prognosis for strabismus in adults? The prognosis for strabismus in adults is generally good. Most adults respond well to vision therapy and/or eye muscle surgery. The best results usually occur when treatment is started early, before the patient has serious eye problems or a lazy eye.","1. Lazy eye or amblyopia is a vision problem that occurs when the brain does not properly interpret the signals sent from one eye to the brain. 2. The brain is trained to see with both eyes. 3. If one eye has poorer vision than the other, the brain will begin to rely more on the clearer vision eye. 4. This process is called suppression. 5. Suppression is a natural process that helps the brain ignore the blurrier image from one eye. 6. The goal of amblyopia treatment is to reverse this process and re-train the brain to see with both eyes. 7. Traditional amblyopia treatment involves patching the ""good"" eye and forcing the ""lazy"" eye to work harder. 8. Patching the good eye means covering it so that only the lazy eye sees. 9. This forces the brain to rely on the lazy eye for vision. 10. The brain then begins to re-train and the vision in the lazy eye improves. 11. This process can take several months or even years. 12. Adult stem cell research has identified the cellular and molecular bases of visual functions in the brain. 13. This will lead to new approaches to treat amblyopia by retraining the brain.",1) Strabismus (crossed eye) repair is usually done by surgery. 2) There is no research on adult stem cells for this condition. 3) The surgery is followed by rehabilitation of the eye muscles and brain through exercises and vision training.,"1. What is a lazy eye? A lazy eye is an eye that has reduced or no vision because the eye muscles do not work together properly. One cause of this problem is strabismus, a misalignment of the eyes. In strabismus, the eyes are not parallel. One eye turns in, out, up, or down while the other eye looks straight at a target. 2. How does strabismus affect vision? In a child with strabismus, the misaligned eye is often ""lazy,"" meaning it has reduced vision because it is out of position. The brain learns to ignore the input from one eye and this can cause vision problems. 3. What causes strabismus? There are many causes of strabismus including: - cranial nerve palsy - cataracts - glaucoma - retinal disease - neurological conditions 4. How is strabismus treated? Treatment for strabismus depends on the cause. Surgery is usually the best treatment for eye muscle problems. Glasses, contact lenses, or vision therapy may also be used. 5. Are there other treatments for lazy eye? Researchers are investigating new treatments for lazy eye. One of these treatments involves injecting a chemically-induced ""lazy"" eye with a type of adult stem cells. The stem cells then supposedly retrain the brain to use the lazy eye's input. 6. Where can I find out more about research on lazy eye? The National Eye Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is responsible for many clinical trials on eye research.

"1. Treatment of mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient is often treated on an outpatient basis, unless other medical or psychiatric problems require inpatient treatment. Patients presenting in mild alcohol withdrawal may be treated on an outpatient basis, if no underlying conditions require inpatient treatment. Inpatient treatment is often indicated for patients who have coexisting medical or psychiatric conditions, who have a history of severe withdrawal reactions, or who have a high level of alcohol consumption. The treatment of mild alcohol withdrawal is generally supportive and includes adequate hydration, nutrition, and rest. In patients with mild alcohol withdrawal, sedatives are often not necessary, unless the patient is experiencing significant anxiety or insomnia. The use of sedatives for patients with mild symptoms should be carefully monitored, since they may cause respiratory depression and/or produce a ""rebound"" syndrome with severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures. The treatment of mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome generally does not require the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines. However, the use of sedatives for patients with mild symptoms should be carefully monitored, since they may cause respiratory depression and/or produce a ""rebound"" syndrome with severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures. 2. Treatment of moderate/severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Patients presenting with moderate/severe symptoms or with complications (e.g., seizures) require inpatient treatment and consideration of ICU admission. The use of sedative-hypnotic drugs such as benzodiazepines is the mainstay of treatment. Although any benzodiazepine may be used, the authors recommend a regimen of chlordiazepoxide (orally, if oral route is available; otherwise IV diazepam or lorazepam is recommended), with the dosing depending upon the severity of symptoms. For patients whose symptoms are not severe, the authors recommend initiating treatment with 20-40 mg of chlordiazepoxide every 2-4 hours, as needed, until the patient is calm.","1.

Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. These disturbances can cause significant problems in a person's life, such as difficulties in relationships or inability to work or go to school. 2. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a long-term condition that occurs when the intestines' normal movements are disrupted. IBS is typically defined by abdominal pain or discomfort that is associated with changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation, or passing mucus. 3. There is strong association between PTSD and IBS.","1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits in the absence of detectable structural abnormalities. 2. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. 3. A number of studies have found that patients with IBS have a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety and depression, compared to the general population. 4. Patients with IBS have also been found to have higher rates of PTSD compared to the general population. 5. The rate of PTSD in IBS patients seen in gastroenterology clinics has been found to be as high as 44%. 6. One study found that IBS patients with comorbid PTSD had greater daily symptom severity, poorer health status, and higher medical care costs compared to IBS patients without PTSD. 7. Another study of Veterans Affairs patients with IBS found that those with PTSD had more severe IBS symptoms, greater health care utilization, and higher rates of hospitalization than IBS patients without PTSD. 8. The co-occurrence of IBS and PTSD has been found to be associated with greater psychological distress, poorer quality of life, and higher rates of suicidal ideation than either condition alone. 9. The co-occurrence of IBS and PTSD is also associated with greater health care utilization and higher health care costs.","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are both conditions that can be debilitating. There is little research on the relationship between the two conditions, but there is some evidence that people with PTSD are more likely to have IBS, and vice versa.","1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of detectable structural abnormalities. 2. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of IBS in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients and to determine the relationship between IBS and PTSD. 3. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms ""post-traumatic stress disorder"", ""irritable bowel syndrome"", ""functional bowel disease"", ""bowel disorders"", ""abdominal pain"", and ""altered bowel habits"". 4. Only two studies met our inclusion criteria. Both studies used similar methodology and reported a higher prevalence of IBS in PTSD patients (17%-20%) compared to the general population (3%-8%). Both studies also reported a positive correlation between the severity of PTSD and the risk of IBS. 5. The results of this review indicate a need for more research on the comorbidity of IBS and PTSD. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of IBS in PTSD patients should be made with caution.","1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Brief Review. Author(s): Hull J. (2008).

"1. Yes, the uveitis is an autoimmune disease.2. Uveitis is a common, painful, blinding, and costly disease that affects millions of people worldwide.3. It is the most common form of ocular inflammation and the most common cause of visual loss in the working-age population.4. Uveitis is an autoimmune inflammation of the eye that may affect the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.5. The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis, which affects the iris and/or ciliary body.6. The second most common form of uveitis is intermediate uveitis, which affects the pars plana and peripheral retina.7. Posterior uveitis affects the choroid and is the least common form of uveitis.8. Uveitis may be a feature of an autoimmune process such as sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Behcet disease, and Kawasaki disease.9. In children, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common association, while in adults, the most common association is with the seronegative spondyloarthropathies.10. Uveitis may also be a complication of penetrating trauma and it may also occur after intraocular surgery.11. It has been reported following the use of drugs such as rifampin, sulfonamides, and ethambutol and also following the use of cosmetics.12. Uveitis may be a presentation of infectious diseases such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), herpes zoster virus (HZV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and syphilis.13.

Answer: yes; Uveitis is an autoimmune disease","1. Uveitis is considered as one of the most common forms of autoimmune disease. 2. The autoimmune process may affect the eye in isolation, or the eye may be a part of the systemic involvement. 3. In the early part of the last century, the term ""autoimmune"" was not in use. However, many of the autoimmune diseases were recognized and described. 4. Erythema nodosum, a reddish, painful, tender lesions found most commonly on the shins, was identified as a feature of sarcoidosis, a multisystem disease. 5. In 1933, Pilley reported a case of a patient with bilateral chronic iridocyclitis associated with achromic patches on the skin and the term ""uveitis"" was coined. 6. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by chronic granulomatous uveitis with exudative retinal detachment. It is considered to be an autoimmune disease involving melanocytes. 7. Behcet's disease is a systemic disorder characterized by iridocyclitis, and is associated with aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and erythema multiforme. It is considered an autoimmune disorder. 8. Cogan's syndrome is characterized by interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms and is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. 9. In 1978, the immunomodulatory drug cyclosporine was introduced for clinical use in transplant patients. In 1983, cyclosporine was used to treat severe uveitis in patients with Behcet's disease. This has led to the use of immunomodulatory drugs for many other immune-related disorders of the eye. 10. In 2012, the term ""immunomodulatory"" drugs have entered our vocabulary and includes a large range of medications such as the immunosuppressive agents, biological agents that target specific cytokines such as TNF-alpha, and anti-VEG","1.

These factors include: (1) sleeping on the stomach, (2) soft bedding in the crib, (3) sleeping in the same bed as their parents (co-sleeping), (4) exposure to tobacco smoke while in the womb, and (5) premature birth. 3) To prevent SIDS, follow these guidelines: - Place babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. ""Tummy time"" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching - Use a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet - Keep soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area - Keep babies feet facing up, with the covers tucked in at the foot of the crib mattress. 4) You can find more information on SIDS by contacting the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), or your health care provider.","1. Sudden infant death syn PMC-LLaMA.  While the exact cause of SIDS is not known, experts believe that SIDS is most likely due to the combination of the following: (a) the babies' placement in the prone position (on their stomach) to sleep; (b) their sleeping in the same bed as their parents (in a crib that is too small); and/or (c) their being covered by heavy bedding or clothing. 2. No one knows what causes SIDS. But researchers have identified factors that increase the risk. These include: (a) sleeping in the same bed as their parents (in a crib that is too small); (b) sleeping in the prone (stomach) position; (c) covering their face and head with bedding or clothing; (d) being born into a family where one or both parents smoke; and/or (e) sleeping in the same bed as other children (in a crib that is too small). 3. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies should be placed on their backs to sleep, in a crib that is of the right size for the child. The AAP also recommends that soft surfaces (such as bedding, clothing, or toys) not be placed in or on the sleep area. 4.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies sleep in their own crib, in their own room. The room should be at a comfortable temperature and should be free of potential harm. For example, keep babies away from windows, and make sure that electrical outlets have safety plugs. 6. A baby should not get too hot. Dress the baby in one layer of clothing, and the room should be at a comfortable temperature for an adult. 7. Some research suggests that pacifiers may help reduce the risk of SIDS. However, pacifiers should only be used when babies are sleeping. They should not be used for more than a few months. 8. There is no test to predict whether a baby is at risk for SIDS.

"1. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to that found in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is located outside the uterus. This tissue responds to the changes in hormone levels that occur during the menstrual cycle.2. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. In general, if symptoms are mild, no treatment may be needed. If pain is severe and other treatments have not helped, surgery may be needed.3. Medicine may be used to help symptoms. Birth control pills are often used to treat endometriosis. They can help symptoms by thinning the lining of the uterus and reducing menstrual flow. They can also help by reducing menstrual pain and pelvic pain.4. Surgery is often used to treat endometriosis. Surgery may be used to diagnose endometriosis. It may also be used to treat pain and infertility related to endometriosis. The type of surgery used will depend on where the endometriosis is found and whether the woman would like to become pregnant.","13-year-olds are not commonly diagnosed with endometriosis.

It is a handheld device that you breathe through, and it delivers a type of medicine called a corticosteroid. The specific steroid that is used in this device is a mometasone. The idea is that by delivering the medicine in this way, it will allow people with exercise-induced asthma to exercise without needing to use an inhaler. However, the device does not work for everyone, and it is quite expensive. 2. A second device that is currently available is called the AeroChamber Flow-Vu. It is a device that you breathe through, and it delivers a medicine called albuterol, which is a short-acting bronchodilator. The device is quite inexpensive, and it is designed to be used during exercise.","1. A small study of 10 people with exercise-induced asthma found that breathing through a straw during exercise reduced symptoms. Breathing through pursed lips also seemed to help, but the study was too small to compare these techniques with other treatments. 2. Another small study of 12 people with exercise-induced asthma found that wearing a mask (or, for cyclists, a helmet) during exercise reduced symptoms. 3. Exercise-induced asthma is a type of asthma. Treating it with medications that also control asthma might help. Medications that might help include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), oral steroids, inhaled steroids, and inhaled bronchodilators (medications that help open air passages). But studies on these treatments and exercise-induced asthma have not been done. 4. Some people with exercise-induced asthma also have allergic rhinitis, which may respond to an antihistamine (such as loratadine, Claritin, or cetirizine, Zyrtec). But this has not been studied. 5. Preventive measures may also help. For example, warming up for 10 minutes might help some people with exercise-induced asthma. Another preventive measure is to use a bronchodilator (such as albuterol, Ventolin, or albuterol, Ventolin) before exercising."

"1. The male reproductive system consists of the male gonads (testes), male accessory organs (epididymis, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, prostate, and bulbourethral glands) and the male external genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra). 2. The male gonads consist of two testes suspended in the scrotum. Each testis is divided into lobules, within which are the seminiferous tubules that contain sperm-producing cells. 3. The testes produce sperm and secrete male sex hormones, such as testosterone, through the interstitial cells. 4. Sperm production (spermatogenesis) begins in the testicular cords and proceeds to the seminiferous tubules, where sperm mature and are stored until ejaculation. 5. The male accessory organs produce secretions that contain citric acid and other nutrient substances that enhance sperm motility and viability. 6. The prostate gland produces the alkaline constituent of the seminal fluid, which contains clagulation protein and aids in sperm viability. 7. The bulbourethral glands produce mucus that helps lubricate the urethra, and the urethra transports semen to the exterior of the body during ejaculation. 8. The external male genitalia consists of the penis, which is the male copulatory organ, and the scrotum, which contains the testes. 9. The penis is composed of three cylinders of erectile tissue, the corpus spongiosum, and the corpora cavernosa. The glans is the terminal enlarged portion of the penis. 10. The scrotum consists of loose skin that contains the right and left testes. 11. The scrotum is divided into two sacs by a septum. Each sac contains a testis and epididymis. 12.

"1. The symptoms of both the diseases are different. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease that affects the bones, while Ehlers-Danlos syndrome involves abnormalities in the body's connective tissues. 2. To confirm a diagnosis, you need to undergo genetic testing. You can contact any of the genetic testing laboratories like Ambry Genetics, Sequencing Center, University of California, Los Angeles, etc.","1) The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. 2) Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones that break easily. It is one of a family of diseases that are collectively called collagen disorders because they are caused by problems in the collagen gene. 3) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of rare inherited disorders that affect the body's connective tissues. Connective tissues are the fibers that provide the framework for your body, support your organs and give your body structure. EDS is caused by defects in the genes that make collagen, a protein that provides the strength and flexibility of connective tissues. There are several types of EDS, which are distinguished by the types of collagen affected and the resulting connective tissue problems.","1) There is no specific test available to diagnose Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).  Diagnosis is based on the clinical findings (history and physical examination).  Laboratory tests are done to evaluate possible causes of the symptoms, such as collagen biochemical tests, skin biopsy, DNA mutation analysis, or other tests to evaluate connective tissue disorders.  The tests may be done on blood, other body fluids, or tissue samples. 2) The symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vary greatly from one person to another and within the same family.  Many people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have skin that is either too elastic or too fragile.  The skin may be hyperextensible, meaning it can be stretched too far, or it may heal poorly after an injury or surgery, leaving a scar.  Other common symptoms include joints that are too flexible and/or easily dislocated, scoliosis, or a long, thin body.  People with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may also have dental problems, such as your teeth being either small or large, or having a malocclusion (bad bite). 3) Symptoms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta:  The symptoms of OI can vary greatly from one person to another.  The most common symptoms include:  - Fragile bones that break easily.  - Blue or brown opaque bands or patches in the cornea of the eye.  - Deafness.  - Dentinogenesis imperfecta (genetic disorder of the teeth), which causes teeth to break easily.  - Joint laxity (hyperextensibility).  4) Genetic testing for both EDS and Osteogenesis Imperfecta can be done by either full sequencing of the relevant gene or by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect specific mutations.  Both procedures are expensive and the costs are usually not covered by medical insurance.

Surgery on the eye muscles may be needed to correct eye misalignment. 3. Surgery is usually successful, but there is a risk of complications. These may include infection, bleeding, scarring, and cataracts. 4. There are several types of eye muscle surgery. The type used will depend on your eye problem. 5. Common types of surgery include: 6. - Recession: This is the most common type of eye muscle surgery. In this procedure, the muscle is weakened or repositioned. This causes the eye to move back into place. 7. - Resection: This is the removal of a piece of the eye muscle. This weakens the muscle and causes the eye to move into place. 8. -Transposition: This involves moving an eye muscle so that it pulls on the eye differently. This may help correct eye alignment. 9. -Tenotomy: This involves cutting a piece of the eye muscle. This weakens the muscle and causes the eye to move into place. 10. The surgery is done using local anesthesia, which means you are awake but numb from the waist down. You will also get a sedative to help you relax. 11. Most people can go home the same day.

It is caused by damage to the peripheral nerves that control muscles of the foot and ankle. Foot drop may be caused by a wide range of disorders that may affect the nerves of the leg or the muscles of the foot. It may be caused by diabetes, lead poisoning, alcoholism, polio, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord disease. 2) Peroneal nerve damage: The peroneal nerve is a nerve in the leg that supplies most of the muscles of the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. The nerve also supplies the muscles of the dorsum of the foot. Peroneal nerve damage may occur as a result of injury, such as a fracture or a bullet injury, or as a complication of knee surgery. 3) Foot Palsy: Foot palsy is paralysis of the muscles of the foot.

Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. 2. The virus becomes dormant in the nerves and skin and can reactivate as shingles later in life. 3. Symptoms include a painful rash of blisters that form on one nerve pathway on one side of the body. 4. The blisters usually clear up within two to four weeks. 5. Although the virus is not highly contagious, it can be transmitted to people who have not had chickenpox. 6. Individuals with shingles can still transmit the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox, and that person could develop chickenpox instead of shingles. 7. Workplace considerations include: a. If an employee has active shingles and prepares food, consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether the food preparation area needs to be isolated. b. The employee should be instructed to keep the rash clean and covered to prevent transmission of the virus. c. If the employee has active shingles and comes into contact with coworkers who have not had chickenpox, the employee should wear a mask."

"1) The latest information for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is that the goals of treatment are to reduce pain, prevent joint damage, and improve the patient's quality of life. The treatment plan should be individualized, taking into account the patient's age, sex, and degree of disability; the presence or absence of bone erosions; and the duration of disease. 2) The treatment of RA involves a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic interventions include exercise, education, and psychosocial support. 3) Pharmacologic interventions include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The newest DMARD, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, have been shown to be effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA. The TNF inhibitors include etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. 4) There are also newer biologic agents that target other inflammatory mediators in RA, such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. Anakinra is an IL-1 inhibitor, and the anti-IL-6 drugs include tocilizumab.","1. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors etanercept and infliximab have been approved for use in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. 2. Methotrexate is currently the most commonly used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). 3. The anti-malarials, hydroxychloroquine and, to a lesser extent, chloroquine, are frequently used as first-line drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 4. The immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporine and azathioprine, are used in patients who have failed to respond to other DMARDs. 5. The new class of biological agents, which includes the TNF inhibitors, can be used in patients who have failed to respond to methotrexate.","The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed significantly over the past decade. Before 2000, the main treatment approach was based on the concept of ""irreversible joint damage"" caused by the disease. Consequently, treatment focused mainly on relieving pain and reducing inflammation with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The goal of this approach was to limit the damage caused by the disease.  Today, we have a much better understanding of RA and know that irreversible joint damage occurs within the first 2 years of disease. Moreover, we know that early and aggressive treatment can actually prevent joint damage and disability. Consequently, the goals of treatment have changed. Today, the aim is to achieve remission or low disease activity by combining different treatment approaches.  Treatment is usually stepped up from NSAIDs to DMARDs and/or biologicals. The choice of drug depends on the patient's characteristics, disease severity, and response to previous treatments. For example, methotrexate is the first DMARD of choice, particularly in patients with risk factors for developing RA (such as positive rheumatoid factor, high CRP, or erosions on hand and/or wrist X-rays). If methotrexate fails to achieve remission or low disease activity, another DMARD (such as sulfasalazine) should be tried.  Biologicals (such as tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) are reserved for patients with a poor prognosis (such as those with high levels of disease activity, positive rheumatoid factor, or erosions on X-rays).  Drug combinations are usually used when monotherapy with a DMARD or biological fails to achieve remission or low disease activity. The most frequently used combination is methotrexate plus a TNF inhibitor.  Treatment should also include measures to prevent osteoporosis (such as calcium and vitamin D supplements) and physical therapy (to prevent joint contractures and muscle atrophy).  Patients with RA should receive","1) The American College of Rheumatology recommends treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) as the initial treatment. 2) If the patient has no evidence of disease activity for 3 months or longer, the DMARD should be continued. 3) If the patient has low disease activity or no evidence of disease activity for 3 months or longer, the DMARD should be withdrawn. 4) If the patient has moderate or high levels of disease activity, the DMARD should be continued. 5) If the patient has moderate or high levels of disease activity, the DMARD should be combined with a glucocorticoid.","1. I would suggest that you consult a rheumatologist for further evaluation and management. The treatment options include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, DMARDs, biological agents, etc. 2.

This is a highly specialized procedure and should be done only after consulting a genetic counselor.","1. Yes, IVF can help in reducing the risk of passing on the condition of phaeochromocytoma paraganglioma to the offspring. 2. The technique of IVF involves extraction of the ovum from the ovary, fertilization in vitro and then transfer of the fertilized ovum into the uterus of the female. In this technique, the problem of fertilization with a sperm carrying the defective gene can be avoided. 3. However, IVF may not be able to avoid the inheriting of the defective gene if it is present in the chromosomes of the ovum. 4. It is therefore important that the girlfriend gets herself tested for the presence of the defective gene before she undergoes IVF.","1. Yes, in vitro fertilization can reduce the risk of passing on the condition. 2. The risk of passing on the condition can be further reduced by genetic testing of the egg and sperm before fertilization. This can be done only if the specific genetic mutation causing the condition in your girlfriend's family has been identified. 3. Once the specific mutation is identified, your girlfriend and you can be tested to see whether you carry the mutation. If neither of you has the mutation, none of your children would be at risk of developing the condition. 4. If one or both of you carry the mutation, you can use in vitro fertilization or genetic testing of the egg and sperm to reduce the risk of passing the mutation on to your children.","1) The answer to your question is yes. 2) It is possible that in vitro fertilization will prevent the condition from being passed on, but you should consult with a genetic counselor to confirm this. 3) A genetic counselor will be able to tell you whether your girlfriend should consider in vitro fertilization based on her specific genetic mutation(s). 4) It is important to note that in vitro fertilization is a very expensive procedure and is only available at select centers. 5) I would also recommend that your girlfriend seek the advice of a physician who specializes in the treatment of pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma. 6) There are medications that can be used to manage the symptoms of this disorder. 7) It is also important to note that individuals who have inherited the genetic mutation(s) responsible for pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma can still develop the disorder despite undergoing in vitro fertilization.","1. Yes, IVF can definitely reduce the chance of your child getting this disease. 2. However, it will not completely eliminate the risk of the disease. 3. This is because the genetic material in each egg and sperm is passed on to the next generation. So, there is a chance that the child will inherit the abnormal gene from the mother. 4. This is the reason why even if you undergo IVF, there is still a chance that the child may get this disease. 5. It is possible that the child may inherit the abnormal gene from you. 6. This is because the abnormal gene is passed on by the father too. 7. So, in conclusion, IVF can reduce the risk of your child getting this disease. However, it will not completely eliminate the risk of the disease."

Introduction: Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia, dysarthria, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and cardiomyopathy. Patients often present in the first or second decade of life, and the disease is invariably fatal, with death usually occurring by the fifth decade because of cardiorespiratory compromise. Friedreich ataxia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding frataxin (FXN). Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in iron metabolism. 2. Summary: A novel pharmacological chaperone, namely, 4-phenylbutyrate (PB), has recently been identified as a potential therapy for Friedreich ataxia. 3. Description: The first pharmacological chaperone to be identified, PB enhances the residual function of the misfolded protein, frataxin, leading to significant improvements in the cellular function of the protein. In this article, we review the preclinical development of PB as a potential therapy for Friedreich ataxia, with a focus on its mechanism of action and the results of the clinical trials conducted thus far. 4. Outlook: PB is currently undergoing a phase II/III clinical trial. Data from this trial will determine whether PB can become the first disease-modifying therapy for Friedreich ataxia.","1. The treatment you are talking about is called Gene therapy, which is still in its experimental stages. There are no trials conducted as yet for Friedreich's ataxia. 2. Gene therapy aims at correcting the mutation in the gene itself by introducing a normal gene into the body. 3. The current treatment for Friedreich's ataxia is mainly symptomatic. We treat each symptom as it arises. 4. I would advise you to consult a neurologist and have a regular follow up.","1. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene on chromosome 9q13. 2.

Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.",40% of cases of IDDM are due to autoimmunity (genetic predisposition). 60% of cases of IDDM are non-autoimmune (genetic predisposition).,"4 main factors contributing to insulin-dependent diabetes in kids are: genetic factors, environmental factors, autoimmunity, and non-specific factors.","The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Type 1 diabetes results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. Genetic factors confer susceptibility to the disease. Environmental factors, such as viruses, are thought to trigger the disease process in genetically susceptible individuals. Immune-mediated destruction of the beta cells results in an insufficiency of insulin, which leads to hyperglycemia.","1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), formerly known as juvenile-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes mellitus in which the body does not produce enough insulin. 2. The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known. However, scientists believe that some combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors may trigger the disease. 3. There are several theories about what causes type 1 diabetes. One theory is that the disease results from an autoimmune attack on the cells of the islets of Langerhans, the specialized clusters of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. 4. Another theory is that type 1 diabetes occurs when the body's immune system attacks the beta cells in the pancreas. The body's immune system normally protects it from foreign invaders, such as bacteria, by producing antibodies. 5. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system may mistakenly attack and destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. 6. An additional theory is that type 1 diabetes is caused by a virus that destroys beta cells. 7. The reason why the immune system turns on the body's own cells is not known. Researchers suspect that in genetically susceptible people, the immune attack is triggered by environmental factors such as viral infections. 8. These triggers cause the immune system to become sensitized to the beta cells in the pancreas. In some cases, the body does not make enough insulin. 9. Untreated, the amount of glucose in the blood increases and becomes a condition called diabetes. 10. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually appear quickly and can be very serious. People with type 1 diabetes often have a thin body build and are underweight. They may also have frequent infections. 11. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include: - Being very thirsty and having to urinate often - Increased appetite - Weight loss - Blurry vision - Fatigue - Unusual weight loss - Vaginal yeast infe","1) Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence.

"164 is too high for the morning. You need to be in the hospital for a 24 hour holder to get the problem under control. If you are having nighttime surges you may need a PMC-LLaMA.  If it is just a few readings at night, you may be able to control it with the current medicines but need to be under constant surveillance to make sure it doesn't get out of control.","1. Yes, I've heard of this phenomenon before. It's called the ""masked hypertension"" and the surges of blood pressure happen during sleep.2. The condition is quite common, and the reason for it is that the blood pressure is measured during the day when you're awake and moving around, and it's not as high as it gets during the night when you're sleeping.3. To diagnose masked hypertension, we need to measure your blood pressure during the night using a device called a ""home blood pressure monitor.""4. The condition is treated by increasing the dosage of your blood pressure medications or by adding a new medication.5. I suggest you talk to your doctor about this possibility.","1. The blood pressure of the patient is high at night. 2. There are multiple causes of high blood pressure at night: - It may be due to white coat hypertension. - It may be due to excessive salt intake. - It may be due to stress and anxiety. - It may be due to excessive alcohol intake. - It may be due to the intake of certain medicines like nasal decongestants, NSAIDs, oral contraceptive pills, etc. 3. You have to consult your doctor and get evaluated. Your doctor may advise you to get certain tests done like lipid profile, kidney function tests, renal artery Doppler, etc. Your doctor may change or adjust the doses of your current medicines or may add or remove any medicine according to your test results. 4. If your blood pressure remains high at night, your doctor may advise you to buy a home blood pressure monitoring kit and monitor your blood pressure at home.","24-hour blood pressure monitoring has shown that many people with hypertension have a marked dip in blood pressure at night. This is the opposite of what is expected in hypertension, and it may be related to the body's circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle). It is not clear whether this dip in blood pressure at night plays a role in the development of hypertension.","1. You need to check your blood pressure regularly. 2. You also need to check your blood sugar level. 3. If blood pressure measurement is normal, then the doctor should consider other causes of elevated blood pressure, such as a thyroid problem or kidney disease. 4.

"Thank you for using PMC-LLaMA. My name is PMC-LLaMA.  I am a medical specialist. I am glad that you have asked this question. I will do my best to answer your question.  Glaucoma is a condition in which there is damage to the optic nerve. The damage is caused by increased pressure inside the eye. This increased pressure inside the eye is the result of fluid pressure inside the eye pushing against the back of the eye.  There are different types of glaucoma. Some are due to problems with the clear fluid that nourishes the eye (aqueous humor). This type of glaucoma is called wide-angle glaucoma. Some are due to problems with narrowing of the angle between the clear fluid chamber and the drainage chamber. This narrowing of the angle causes a sudden increase in fluid pressure inside the eye. This type of glaucoma is called angle-closure glaucoma.  Glaucoma can also be caused by trauma to the eye, inflammation, or cataract surgery.  Glaucoma can run in families. If a family member has glaucoma, you are at greater risk of developing glaucoma.  Glaucoma can develop at any age. However, people over 40 years of age are at greater risk of developing glaucoma.  Glaucoma is treated with eye drops, pills, laser surgery, and traditional eye surgery. The choice of treatment depends on the type of glaucoma, the severity of the disease, and other medical conditions like diabetes.  Some people are at risk of developing glaucoma. These people should visit an eye doctor regularly. The risk factors include:  - A family history of glaucoma  - Being over 40 years of age  - High blood pressure  - Diabetes  - A history of eye injury  - Cataract surgery  - Other eye conditions like diabetic retinopathy, chronic iridocyclitis, or macular degeneration  - Systemic conditions like heart disease, thyroid disease, and sleep apnea  - Race (Glaucoma is more common in African Americans than other races)  - Vision problems  - Narrow angles or crowded optic nerve head  - High int","Yes, Glaucoma is a group of diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. There are several types of glaucoma. The most common type, which is open-angle glaucoma, is chronic and slowly progressive. The second type is closed-angle glaucoma, which is an acute condition. There are also congenital, secondary, and juvenile types of glaucoma.","1) Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2) The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma. It is a chronic, painless condition that occurs over many years. Vision loss often occurs very gradually over a long period of time. 3) Another form of glaucoma is acute angle-closure glaucoma. It is a sudden and painful increase in pressure inside the eye. This is a medical emergency. Symptoms may include: - severe eye pain - nausea - vomiting - seeing rainbow-colored halos around lights - sudden sight loss 4) Risk factors include: - being African American over age 40 - having a family history of glaucoma - being in an eye accident or having surgery on your eye - having very high blood pressure or eye injuries 5) To diagnose glaucoma, an eye doctor uses a device called a tonometer to measure eye pressure. An eye exam also includes a visual field test, an optic nerve head exam, and sometimes a gonioscopy to check the drainage angle in the eye. 6) Treatment includes prescription eye drops, surgery or laser treatment. The goal of treatment is to lower eye pressure to a level that prevents vision loss. Prescription eye drops and surgery do that. Laser treatment is different. It is used when eye drops and/or surgery do not work.","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that cause damage to the optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. 2. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma. It is a chronic condition that can damage the optic nerve even though the angle between the iris and cornea is open and normal. 3. In open-angle glaucoma, the fluid pressure inside the eye is higher than normal. This increased pressure in the eye can damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss and blindness. 4. There is no cure for glaucoma. However, glaucoma can usually be controlled and vision loss minimized with early treatment. 5. Treatments include prescription eyedrops, glaucoma surgery, and other vision-saving strategies.","1.

The signs and symptoms of dry mouth are a result of an inadequate volume of saliva.3. Saliva is important for maintaining oral health. It is a complex fluid that contains mucins, water, organic and inorganic ions, and dissolved substances that are important for oral health.4. Dry mouth is one of the most common oral complaints in the United States, affecting an estimated 11%-19% of the population.5. Two major categories of dry mouth include diseases of the salivary glands (e.g., Sjogren syndrome) and those caused by drugs, radiation, or autoimmune diseases.6. Common symptoms include dryness, thirst, difficulty in swallowing, and a dry, furry tongue.7. Treatment of dry mouth should be directed toward the underlying cause.8.

70 to 80% of small intestine can die without any predisposing factors or symptoms.  I would guess that he had a thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels that supply the intestine.  It is possible that he had symptoms of pain or distention that was not recognized by him or his family.  It is also possible that he had an infection or inflammation.  Often times these things happen without warning.  The treatment is to replace the lost intestine with either the remaining intestine that is healthy or with a portion of the colon.  This is a common surgery and one that is relatively straightforward.  He will need to be on supplemental nutrition for a while to make up for the loss of intestine.  He will also need to be on antibiotics to prevent infection.  The recovery from this surgery is usually uneventful and complete.

The damage was so severe that the remaining intestine could not be salvaged.,"70-80% of the small intestine is removed due to a condition called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a life-threatening condition that occurs when bacteria invade the intestines, causing tissue death and inflammation. NEC is most common in premature infants, though it can affect people of any age.  Premature infants, especially those born before 32 weeks of pregnancy, are at highest risk. The earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk. Risk also goes up if a baby has a low birth weight or was delivered by C-section. Adults who have other health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes, are also at risk. NEC can quickly lead to complications such as infection, blood poisoning, and perforation, which can be life-threatening.  Symptoms of NEC include loss of appetite, abdominal swelling, bloody stools, and fever. Because these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, it can be hard to diagnose NEC. Doctors may use x-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, and blood tests to diagnose NEC. Treatment includes medications to fight infection, and in severe cases, surgery to remove the affected part of the intestine.","100% possible, 100% probable, 100% inevitable if the person happens to have celiac disease and/or a gluten allergy and continues to eat gluten."

"1. Gene mutation tests are available for many diseases. However, before going for any gene mutation test, the doctors should know the disease, because they are a lot of diseases, and we should be sure that, the particular disease we are suspecting, has a gene mutation test available. 2. For example, cystic fibrosis has a gene mutation test available, but it can only tell, whether the person is a carrier or not. We do not get to know, which particular mutation is present. This is because, there are more than 1000 mutations in the CFTR gene, which can cause cystic fibrosis. 3. For each mutation, a separate test has to be written, and all these tests are costly. So, if we do not know which mutation is present, we cannot go for the test. 4. In a nutshell, we should know the disease, and should know the particular mutation involved in that disease, before going for a gene mutation test.","Yes, there are genetic tests available that can identify mutations in a gene without knowing the specific disease. These tests are called diagnostic or disease-specific whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. They are expensive and require significant analysis of the genetic data by trained geneticists and physicians. It is important to note that these tests may identify variants of uncertain significance, which are changes in the DNA sequence that may or may not cause disease. The clinical interpretation of these results is an ongoing area of active research.","Yes, genetic testing can be used to diagnose genetic conditions even when symptoms have not yet appeared or when they have not yet developed to the point of being recognizable.  In fact, some parents choose to have a child tested for a genetic condition before the baby is even born.  Testing can help detect genetic mutations that could lead to a serious health problem in the child.  For example, a woman who is at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis because she herself has a CF mutation may opt for genetic testing while she is pregnant.  If the baby is found to be free of CF mutations, then the mother can be reassured that her baby will not have the disease.  On the other hand, if the baby does have a CF mutation, the mother can be counseled about her options for dealing with this situation.  Similarly, genetic testing can be used to diagnose genetic conditions that may not manifest themselves in some family members until they are older, such as Huntington's disease.","Yes, it is possible to undergo genetic testing to identify a mutation without knowing the underlying illness.  The process of identifying a mutation is called gene mapping or linkage analysis.  This process can be used to identify a mutation even if the specific disease causing the mutation is unknown.  Once the mutation is identified, researchers can use the mutation to track down the gene and the protein it makes, and this can ultimately lead to the identification of the disease.  However, this process can be time consuming and expensive.  Often, researchers have a good idea of what gene is involved based on the symptoms of the disease, and they can use this knowledge to focus their efforts on identifying the specific mutation.","1) Yes, there are genetic tests that can detect mutations without a specific diagnosis.  These are called ""diagnostic panels"" or ""multiplex genetic testing"". They test multiple genes at once for known mutations that can cause diseases in many different organ systems. 2) However, the decision to do genetic testing should not be taken lightly. It is important to know what you are looking for and why you are doing the testing. Sometimes, it is possible to ""open a Pandora's box"" and learn information that you might not want to know.","Yes, genetic testing can be used to identify mutations that cause or increase the risk of developing a wide range of conditions, including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Genetic testing can also be used to identify genetic changes that may increase a person's risk of developing certain types of cancer, even though they may have no signs or symptoms of that cancer. This is called a predisposition genetic test."
"1. Yes, subacute sclerosis panencephalitis (SSPE) can occur at 33 years of age. 2. The risk is higher if he is not vaccinated and gets measles. 3. Please get vaccinated at the earliest. 4. SSPE is a slow progressive disease with death occurring within 3-4 years.","1. Yes, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) can occur in someone who didn't receive the measles vaccination at 33 years old. The incidence of SSPE has decreased dramatically since the introduction of widespread measles vaccination programs because measles infection is prevented at a young age. 2. SSPE usually develops after a prolonged latent period following an initial measles infection. The average age of onset of SSPE is 6-13 years of age, but the range of onset is from 3 to 50 years of age. 3. The risk of SSPE developing after a person has had a measles infection is approximately 1 in 300,000. The risk is much higher if the initial measles infection occurred when the person was younger than 2 years of age (1 in 50,000). 4. In the United States, the incidence of SSPE is estimated to be 6 cases per million live births. The current incidence is thought to be lower due to widespread measles vaccination. 5. Persons who have not been immunized against measles and who are exposed to measles or who develop a measles infection are at risk of developing SSPE.","Yes. The onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) can occur at any age, even in the second decade of life. However, in individuals who are not vaccinated against measles, the mean age of onset is 35 years.",1-10 years after the primary infection (1-5 years in vaccinated individuals) 15-20 years after the primary infection (10-20 years in vaccinated individuals) 1-10 years after the primary infection (1-5 years in vaccinated individuals),"1. There is a small risk of contracting SSPE if not vaccinated against measles. 2. If vaccinated, the chance of getting SSPE is almost nonexistent. 3. In countries where vaccination is mandatory, SSPE is very rare. 4. There is no risk of getting SSPE if vaccinated before the age of 9 months.","1. No, a person who didn't receive the measles vaccine at 33 years old is not at risk of developing SSPE in the future, because SSPE is caused by the persistence of measles virus infection in brain cells and it usually happens during childhood. 2. However, if the person is suffering from a weak immune system, he can be at risk for developing SSPE."

But there are some important differences between the two conditions.,1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and metatropic dysplasia are two forms of dysplasia that are clinically and radiologically similar. 2. Prenatal diagnosis of these conditions can be made by DNA analysis or by ultrasound examination. 3. Prenatal ultrasound findings of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia include short long bones with flattened epiphyses and metaphyseal cupping. 4. Prenatal ultrasound findings of metatropic dysplasia include short long bones with flattened epiphyses and metaphyseal undulation.,"1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia comprises a group of conditions with multiple inheritance patterns and variable clinical presentations. It is characterized by short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and mild to severe intellectual disability. It results from mutations in genes that encode type II collagen, and the severity of the condition is influenced by the type and location of the mutation within the gene. 2. Metatropic dysplasia is a rare condition characterized by dwarfism, kyphoscoliosis, bowed legs, waddling gait, and characteristic facial features. It is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which encodes a receptor critical to bone development.","1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) and metatropic dysplasia (MD) are two distinct entities with different mode of inheritance, clinical manifestations and radiological features. 2. SED is an autosomal dominant condition with manifestations mainly in the skeletal system. 3. MD is an autosomal recessive condition with manifestations in the skeletal, nervous and gastro-intestinal systems. 4. The two conditions can be distinguished by their mode of inheritance, clinical manifestations and radiological features.","1. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is characterized by short stature, short neck, short trunk, and platyspondyly (i.e., flattened vertebrae). Clinical manifestations of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia appear in early childhood. At birth, the affected infant may be normal in both size and appearance. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous, with at least 3 forms: X-linked, Type II, and Type III. X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is due to mutations in the COL2A1 gene, resulting in abnormalities in type II collagen. Type II and Type III spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia are due to mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, resulting in abnormalities in type I collagen. 2. Metatropic dysplasia is characterized by mild to severe dwarfism, with normal growth occurring until the age of 2 years, followed by rapid deceleration to below-normal height by age 4 years. Clinical manifestations include kyphoscoliosis, small chest, and short limbs. Metatropic dysplasia is genetically heterogeneous, with both autosomal-recessive and dominant forms. The autosomal-recessive form is due to mutations in the ENPP1 gene, resulting in deficiency of diphosphate nucleotidase. The dominant form is due to mutations in the FGFR3 gene, resulting in dwarfism due to abnormal endochondral bone formation. 3. Prenatal differentiation of these disorders is possible by assessing the biochemical levels of the specific enzymes involved. For example, elevated levels of type II collagen can be identified in the amniotic fluid of affected fetuses at risk for X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia."

"1) Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disorder that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). This condition can lead to weak bones, kidney stones, and in some cases, kidney failure. 2) There are two types of distal renal tubular acidosis: type 1 and type 2. Type 1, also called classic distal renal tubular acidosis, is caused by a problem with a gene. It occurs in both males and females. Type 2, also called proximal renal tubular acidosis, is rare. It occurs mostly in males. 3) Causes of distal renal tubular acidosis include: • Autosomal recessive inherited conditions • Autoimmune disorders • Damage from ingested toxins • Damage from drugs, such as amphotericin B, ifosfamide, and acetazolamide • Kidney (renal) stone or obstruction • Long-term use of drugs that increase acid levels, such as amphotericin B and acetazolamide • Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood • Rare inherited conditions, such as Carpenter syndrome and nephronophthisis 4) The most common sign is too much acid in the blood. Other symptoms vary depending on the cause of the condition. 5) Distal renal tubular acidosis is diagnosed with blood and urine tests. In some cases, other tests are needed to determine the cause.

The most common cause of dRTA is a genetic defect. Genetic testing is available for some forms of dRTA;4. In children, dRTA may occur as a component of the autosomal recessive disorder known as Cystinosis.5. In adults, dRTA can occur in association with such autoimmune diseases as Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus;6. Other causes of dRTA include the ingestion of certain medications (e.g. acetazolamide, topiramate, and amphotericin B), multiple myeloma, obstructive uropathy, and renal transplantation;7.

"1. The thumb and index finger are supplied by a nerve called the median nerve. 2. There are medicines called nerve dampers that can help relieve the pain. These medicines are usually prescribed for other reasons but they also help relieve nerve pain.3. If the pain is severe, then you may need a steroid injection into the area. This can often help relieve the pain for a long time. 4. If the pain is very severe, then surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve may be needed.","1. Carpal tunnel syndrome: The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand. The median nerve passes through this area and can become compressed, causing pain, weakness, and tingling. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common nerve entrapments of the upper extremity. It is most often caused by repetitive stress, although it can occur from trauma, inflammation, swelling, or a space-occupying lesion. Treatment includes rest, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and splinting. If symptoms persist, then a nerve conduction study should be performed. Treatment options include steroid injections and surgical release. 2. Ulnar tunnel syndrome: The ulnar tunnel is the area where the ulnar nerve travels from the elbow to the hand. The ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the small finger and half of the ring finger. Symptoms include pain, numbness, and tingling in the small finger and ring finger. It is caused by trauma, repetitive stress, and pressure to the nerve. Initial treatment is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome. If symptoms persist, then a nerve conduction study should be performed.

Bronchiolitis obliterans.4. Airway obstruction can also occur in the larger airways, in which case the term ""air trapping"" is usually not used. For example, this can occur in conditions such as acute severe asthma or foreign body aspiration.5. In the most severe cases of obstruction, the affected alveoli may collapse, leading to a condition known as ""atelectasis"".","1. The first thing to do is to determine the cause of the problem. There are a number of possibilities, including: a foreign body in the airway, a tumor or other growth in the airway, compression of the airway by a tumor or growth outside the airway, compression of the airway by a condition in the chest, inflammation of the airway (bronchitis). A history and physical examination are helpful in determining the most likely cause. In some cases, x-rays, CT scans, or other imaging studies are needed.

It is used to treat a variety of pain conditions including low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, knee pain, and neuropathic pain. Electric stimulation may be used alone or in combination with other treatments such as physical therapy, exercise, and medication. 2) Electric stimulation is thought to work by stimulating large nerve fibers which lessens the perception of pain and promotes the release of endorphins (natural pain killers). 3) Electric stimulation can be administered by several methods including: a) Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) - Electrodes are placed on the skin near the painful area and a small electric current is delivered to the nerves. b) Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) - Fine needles are placed directly into the muscle and electrical current is delivered. c) Spinal cord stimulation - Electrodes are surgically implanted in the spinal cord and connected to a pulse generator that is placed under the skin. The electrodes deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord which lessens the perception of pain. 4) Electric stimulation is typically used for the treatment of chronic pain. It is not typically used for acute pain. 5) Electric stimulation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of low back pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain. It has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain such as that caused by diabetic neuropathy, shingles, and sciatica. Electric stimulation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome. 6) Electric stimulation may also be used in the treatment of migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, and postsurgical pain. 7) Electric stimulation may be used in conjunction with other treatments such as physical therapy, medication, and exercise.",1.

Yes, we do have data on electric stimulation treatment. 2. Electric stimulation treatment is known as Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and is a non-invasive treatment that uses low voltage, small current, and long duration pulses to stimulate nerves. 3. TENS has been used for many years to treat chronic pain. It works by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain. 4. TENS also causes the release of endorphins (natural painkillers). 5. Electric stimulation treatment may be used for pain caused by: - Neuropathy - Postherpetic neuralgia - Complex regional pain syndrome - Pain related to the spine such as failed back surgery syndrome - Arthritis 6. Electric stimulation treatment is often used in addition to other pain treatments such as medications and physical therapy. 7. Studies show that TENS is effective at reducing pain in people with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, postherpetic neuralgia, and other conditions. 8. Electric stimulation treatment is non-invasive and safe. Side effects are rare but may include skin irritation and temporary changes in heart rate or rhythm. 9. TENS may be used in the hospital or at home. It is available as a unit or probe that is placed on the skin. The unit is small and battery-powered. A doctor must prescribe the machine and a trained person must teach the patient how to use it.","1.

If the infection has not been cured, patient should be treated for a second time. 8. All sexual partners of the patient should be traced and treated even if they do not have symptoms of the disease.","1. The VDRL test is a nonspecific test for syphilis and indicates the presence of antibodies that react with certain cardiolipin antigens. It is used as a screening test for syphilis and as an indicator of the response to therapy. False-positive results may occur in a variety of other conditions, including some viral infections, non-specific rheumatic disorders, and old age. A positive (reactive) VDRL test should always be confirmed with a specific test for syphilis such as the FTA-ABS. 2. A positive (reactive) VDRL test should always be confirmed with a specific test for syphilis such as the FTA-ABS. 3. In addition, the VDRL test can be used to estimate the so-called ""workers' risk"" of acquiring syphilis, by testing unvaccinated health care workers who may have been exposed to the disease through their work. A positive test result indicates that the individual has been exposed to the T pallidum and therefore needs treatment to prevent the development of clinical syphilis. 4. False-positive results may occur in a variety of other conditions, including some viral infections, non-specific rheumatic disorders, and old age.","1) The VDRL test is a nontreponemal serological test for syphilis. 2) A reactive (positive) VDRL test needs to be confirmed by another serological test for syphilis, such as RPR or FTA-ABS. 3) Patients with a reactive VDRL test should be considered for treatment for syphilis unless adequate treatment can be documented within the past year. 4) Patients with a reactive VDRL test should be instructed to inform sexual partners and should be given information regarding syphilis and the importance of treating asymptomatic sexual partners."
"1. The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria can be resistant to many antibiotics.2. The best way to prevent the spread of MRSA is good hygiene.3. Wash your hands regularly and keep your skin clean and covered.4. If you have an open wound, wash it regularly with antiseptic.5. Do not share razors, towels, clothing or bedding.6. If you have MRSA, stay away from crowded areas.7. If you are a healthcare worker, wear gloves and wash your hands regularly.8. Contact your local health department if you think you have MRSA.9. Your doctor may order a skin or blood test to check for MRSA.10. There is no home test for MRSA.","1. Culture - 30-day post-treatment surveillance cultures of the anterior nares are recommended as part of a comprehensive MRSA decolonization protocol.2. Molecular testing - PCR tests for S. aureus can detect both colonization and infection. However, because of the high prevalence of colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in some settings, a positive PCR test for S. aureus may not necessarily indicate a failure of antibiotic therapy if the patient is culture-negative.","1. Genetic tests can be used to detect the presence or absence of the mecA gene, which is the gene that contains the information for the altered PBP2a. 2. If the gene is present, then the bacterium is resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics. 3. If the gene is absent, then the bacterium is susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics.","1)Blood test: A blood test can check for MRSA bacteria in the bloodstream. 2) Chest x-ray: A chest x-ray can be used to look for pneumonia caused by MRSA. 3) CT scan: A CT scan can be used to look for pneumonia caused by MRSA. 4) MRI scan: An MRI scan can be used to look for deep-seated infections caused by MRSA. 5) Tests on cough: A sample of sputum can be checked for MRSA. Also, a health care provider can listen to a person's breathing and look for signs of pneumonia. Another test involves a health care provider taking a sample of lung tissue by inserting a small, flexible tube through the nose into the lung (bronchoscopy). Another test involves a health care provider inserting a needle into the chest to remove a sample of lung tissue (transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy). The tissue is then checked for MRSA.","1. Yes, there are several tests that can be done to check for MRSA clearance. 2. Most commonly, a swab sample from the nose or throat is taken to check if MRSA is present. 3. This is followed by a blood test called a PCR test which checks for MRSA bacteria in the blood. 4. If both these tests are negative for MRSA, it means that you do not have the bacteria in your system. 5. However, if either of these tests is positive, it means that you still have MRSA bacteria in your system and you may need to repeat the tests after a few days to check if the bacteria have cleared.","1. No diagnostic test can confirm MRSA has been eradicated from the body after prolonged antibiotic use. 2. The only way to know if MRSA has been eradicated from the body is through cultures of nasal swabs, blood, and other appropriate body fluids. 3. The cultures must be negative for MRSA after prolonged antibiotic use to know that MRSA has been eradicated from the body."
"1) Papilloma is a benign tumor, which will grow slowly over time. 2) Papilloma may become cancerous, which will grow more quickly. 3) The surgery to remove a papilloma is very simple and safe. 4) You may want to wait until the tumor gets larger or until it becomes cancerous, which can be determined with follow-up ultrasound examinations. 5) You may want to have the procedure because you have symptoms from the tumor, such as abdominal pain or nausea. 6) You may not want the surgery because of the risks, such as bleeding or infection.","1) Papilloma may grow larger and spread into surrounding tissues, making it harder to remove; 2) it may become cancerous and spread to other parts of the body; or 3) it may become so large that it causes pain or other problems. Removal of a papilloma is much easier when it is small.","1. Papillomas rarely transform into malignant tumors.2. The most common symptom of a papilloma is bleeding, which can often be controlled by cautery.3. The risk of a squamous cell carcinoma developing in a papilloma is less than 1%.4.
