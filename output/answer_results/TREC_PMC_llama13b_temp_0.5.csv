Cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by deposition of amyloid in the myocardium. The most common form of systemic amyloidosis involving the heart is light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis may be suspected from the clinical features, but the diagnosis is usually made by examination of tissue biopsies. The prognosis is poor, with death due to progressive heart failure. 2. Cardiac Amyloidosis: A form of amyloidosis that affects the heart. Cardiac amyloidosis can be classified into two forms: primary and secondary. Primary cardiac amyloidosis occurs when there is no other apparent disease. Secondary cardiac amyloidosis occurs when the heart is affected by a disease, such as multiple myeloma. 3. Cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis is a condition in which a substance called amyloid builds up in the heart. Amyloid is an abnormal protein that is produced in different types of cells in the body. Cardiac amyloidosis can cause the heart to become larger and more rigid, which makes it harder for the heart to pump blood.

"Migraine is a disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of severe headache often associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and sometimes preceded by aura.  It is a common disorder affecting around 15% of women and 6% of men over a one year period.  The economic costs are significant with 1.3 days per month lost to absenteeism, and the personal costs can be high with a reduced quality of life.  In addition, people with migraine are more likely to have comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety.  There are many possible triggers for migraine including: lack of sleep, stress, exercise, certain foods, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, and bright or flashing lights.  While there is no cure for migraine, treatments are available to help abort an attack or reduce the number of attacks.  Abortive treatments include: pain relief medication, triptans, ergotamine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Prophylactic treatments include: beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, Botox injections, and Botox injections.  The goal of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.  Treatment is individualized based on patient-specific factors such as: age, comorbid medical conditions, medication history, and frequency and severity of attacks.  In general, the first line of treatment is usually an abortive medication.  If the frequency of attacks is high (more than two per month), a prophylactic medication is added to the treatment regimen.  A headache diary is recommended to help the patient track their headache frequency, severity, and possible triggers.  It is also recommended that the patient try to identify triggers and eliminate them if possible.

Research has identified several medications to be effective in treating migraines. These include: propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, sodium valproate, gabapentin, topiramate, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, verapamil, and flunarizine. Some of these medications, such as propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, and sodium valproate, are also used to prevent migraines. Several medications are also used to treat acute migraine attacks, including ergotamine, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, and dihydroergotamine.","1. Summary: The pharmacologic treatment of migraine has been the subject of intense research for the past 25 years. In addition to the development of the triptans, a new class of antimigraine drugs, there have been many studies of the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, anticonvulsants, and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of migraine. This has led to the establishment of first-line agents for the treatment of migraine. 2. Objective: To review the evidence supporting the use of these first-line agents for the treatment of migraine. 3. Data Sources: A MEDLINE search was conducted using the terms migraine, treatment, and trials. The Cochrane Collaboration was also consulted. 4. Study Selection: All English-language, randomized, controlled trials that compared active treatment with placebo in the treatment of migraine were selected. Studies that involved only prophylaxis were excluded. 5. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on study design, patient population, methods of assessing efficacy, and results. 6. Conclusion: The data from randomized controlled trials show that when a patient with migraine presents in the office, the first-line treatments are prochlorperazine, narcotic + prochlorperazine, ergotamine, and sumatriptan. When a patient with migraine calls for help, the first-line treatment is sumatriptan.","2012: First-line therapies for the acute treatment of migraine are NSAIDs and triptans. Both are considered effective for all types of migraine. However, triptans are considered to be most effective in patients with migraine associated with nausea and vomiting. Triptans are also considered to be most effective in patients with migraine associated with photophobia and phonophobia. NSAIDs are considered to be most effective in patients with migraine without aura.","1. No. There is a lack of clinical evidence that supports the efficacy of any specific treatment for the prevention or treatment of migraine. 2. Although a number of clinical trials have been performed, the results of these trials have been inconsistent. In many cases, the results of trials have been contradictory, making it difficult to establish clear evidence of efficacy for any specific treatment. 3. This lack of evidence is likely a result of the biological complexity of migraine and the limitations of available clinical trial designs.

Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism--the way the body uses energy--and affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the body's functions slow down.  Hypothyroidism is often called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism can be caused by problems in the thyroid gland or by problems in the pituitary gland, the part of the brain that makes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH tells the thyroid gland how much thyroid hormone to make.  Most people with hypothyroidism have the condition because they have an underactive thyroid gland. This is called primary hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism is usually the result of an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders cause the body to make antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. These antibodies cause the thyroid gland to make too little thyroid hormone.  Other causes of primary hypothyroidism include thyroid gland surgery, radiation treatment of the thyroid gland, and certain medicines that can damage the thyroid gland.  Some people have hypothyroidism because their pituitary gland does not make enough TSH. This is called secondary hypothyroidism. Causes include tumors of the pituitary gland and brain, and damage to the pituitary gland from radiation treatment or trauma.  The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is more common in women and people with a family history of thyroid disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.  Other causes of hypothyroidism include radiation treatment of the thyroid gland, and certain medicines that can damage the thyroid gland.","1.

"Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that involves a decrease in thinking and reasoning skills and changes in behavior. People with Lewy body dementia may experience depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or touches that a person believes to be real but are not real). This type of dementia occurs when abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, develop in the brain. The disease gets its name from these abnormal structures.  Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of dementia. It is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease because the symptoms are similar.  Lewy body dementia is caused by abnormal protein structures, called Lewy bodies, developing in the brain. The disease occurs when these abnormal structures accumulate and die nerve cells in specific areas of the brain.  Lewy body dementia symptoms occur when these nerve cells die in the areas of the brain involved in thinking, reasoning, and movement.","Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that involves abnormal structures in the brain called Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are composed of a protein called alpha-synuclein. In Lewy body dementia, the number of Lewy bodies in the brain increases, causing problems with thinking, movement and behavior. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the disease. However, rare familial forms have been described. Symptoms of Lewy body dementia include: * Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness * Recurrent visual hallucinations, usually related to people or animals * Spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism (slowness of movement, stiffness, muscle rigidity, gait and posture disturbances), or features of other synucleinopathies (such as, multisystem atrophy or pure autonomic failure) * Sleep disturbances (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder), often with excessive daytime sleepiness * Neuropsychiatric symptoms (delusions, depression, apathy, anxiety) * REM sleep behavior disorder is a condition in which the muscles are active during REM sleep. This results in jerky movements during dreams. People with this condition often act out their dreams, which can include kicking, punching, screaming or shouting. REM sleep behavior disorder is often associated with Lewy body dementia, but it can also occur without dementia. Diagnosis of Lewy body dementia requires a brain biopsy or postmortem examination to confirm the presence of Lewy bodies. Other conditions can cause similar symptoms, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lewy body dementia is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease because the symptoms are similar. Lewy body dementia is distinguished from Alzheimer's disease by the presence of visual hallucinations, spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism, and the absence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (i.e., beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) on brain biopsy or autopsy. There is no cure for Lewy body","1. Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of progressive dementia. 2. Lewy body dementia is characterized by both cognitive decline & movement disorders. 3. Lewy body dementia currently has no cure or FDA approved treatments. 4.

Without treatment, infants with MSUD will not thrive, often dying within a week after birth. 4. Treatment requires a special diet, medications, and sometimes dialysis or a kidney transplant. 5. Researchers are working on gene therapy to correct the underlying cause of MSUD.","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and BCKDHS genes can result in maple syrup urine disease. These genes carry the instructions for making proteins that work together to break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many types of food, especially protein-rich foods such as milk and meat. 2. Mutations in any of these three genes can result in a group of disorders known as branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deficiency, which includes maple syrup urine disease. 3. The disorder is characterized by feeding problems, loss of appetite, vomiting, and high levels of amino acids in the blood and urine. 4.

Treatment may include a special diet, vitamin supplements, and use of a formula for infants.","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These three genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together. These proteins are involved in breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many foods, including milk and dairy products, and some meats. If any of these three genes has a mutation, the protein does not work properly. This disrupts the breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which then build up in the body. 2. The build-up of these amino acids leads to the symptoms of maple syrup urine disease. These symptoms can include feeding problems, vomiting, poor weight gain, and neurological problems such as seizures. Infants with maple syrup urine disease are often irritable and have trouble sleeping. They may have a maple syrup-like odor to their urine. As children get older, they may develop mental and physical retardation. 3. Diagnosis of maple syrup urine disease is based on the patient's symptoms and a test called mass spectrometry, which measures the levels of amino acids in the blood. Other tests that can help support the diagnosis include a urine test and a blood test. 4. Treatment of maple syrup urine disease involves dietary changes and sometimes medications. Dietary changes include a special diet that is low in branched-chain amino acids. A small number of patients may need liver transplants.","1. Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and BCKDHC genes that encode the enzymes that regulate branched-chain amino acid breakdown cause maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). 2.

"1. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition in which the diaphragm (a muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen) fails to close during prenatal development and does not form properly. 2. The cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is unknown. 3. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia can occur in isolation or in association with other disorders, including the following: chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome; neuromuscular disorders, such as spina bifida; genetic disorders, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; cleft lip and palate; and heart defects. 4. In most cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a sporadic occurrence. 5. In a few cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome. 6. CDH occurs in about 1 in 2,500 newborns, affecting boys and girls equally. 7. CDH is associated with a high mortality rate, with 70 to 80 percent of affected infants dying within the first few weeks of life. 8. The defect allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity, which prevents proper lung development. 9. The lungs are not able to fill with air, and this prevents the baby from getting enough oxygen. 10. In severe cases, the heart may be forced to work harder to pump blood through the body. 11. Babies with CDH may have other complications, including: 12. The abnormal position of the intestines can cause a blockage or obstruction. 13. The liver may be forced into an abnormal position, which can make it difficult for the baby to eat and digest food. 14. The abnormal position of the stomach can cause problems with digesting food. 15. The diaphragm defect can cause a problem with the position of the esophagus. 16.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition that can be inherited, and the term 'congenital' indicates that it can affect future generations. 2. The inheritance of CDH is autosomal dominant, which means that a child only needs to inherit one copy of the abnormal gene from one parent to potentially acquire the condition. 3. In most cases, the abnormal gene is inherited from a person who also has the condition, and therefore is said to be 'congenital'. 4. A small number of cases of CDH occur as a result of new mutations, which means that the abnormal gene is not inherited from a parent who also has the condition, but rather from one parent who does not have the condition. These cases are referred to as'sporadic'.","1. Yes, CDH can be passed down to future generations. It is a genetic condition, and it can be transmitted in families. 2.

"1. Diabetes insipidus is a condition that causes frequent urination. It is most often caused by the inability of the body to respond to the hormone ADH (anti-diuretic hormone), which is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland. When ADH is released into the bloodstream, it acts on the kidneys to reduce the amount of fluid produced in the urine. People with diabetes insipidus lack ADH, or have a kidney problem that prevents ADH from working properly. As a result, large amounts of diluted urine are produced by the kidneys. 2. The most common cause of diabetes insipidus is the removal of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces ADH. Other causes include damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland from a tumor, infection, inflammation, or genetic disorders. 3. Diagnosis is made by a water deprivation test.

"1. The genetic test is done to detect whether the person has a genetic alteration that increases his or her risk of developing a certain disease.2. The test can be done on a person who is diagnosed with a disease, or it can be done on a person who has no symptoms of the disease.3. The test can detect a genetic alteration that is present at birth (congenital) or that develops later in life.4. Sometimes, the test can be done to help diagnose a disease. For example, some genetic tests can help diagnose Huntington disease or certain types of cancer.5. In other cases, the test can help predict whether a person will develop a disease later in life, such as some forms of cancer.6. The test can also help determine whether a person is at risk for having a child or grandchild with a genetic disease.7.

It is possible to do genetic testing for the inherited forms of lung cancer such as small cell lung cancer.  However, the more common forms of lung cancer are not inherited.  In order to determine if your husband's family has an inherited form of lung cancer, you will need to gather information about his mother and her relatives who have had lung cancer.  This information will need to include the type of lung cancer, the age at which they developed lung cancer, and whether there was any family history of lung cancer.  With this information, a geneticist can determine if there is a pattern of lung cancer that suggests an inherited form of lung cancer.  The information can also be put into a computer program that can estimate the likelihood that your husband's family has an inherited form of lung cancer.","Yes, family members who have a lung cancer diagnosis can be tested for a genetic mutation known to be associated with familial lung cancer. If the test shows that a mutation is not present, this suggests that the lung cancer is not genetic. If a mutation is detected, this suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition to lung cancer.","Yes, genetic testing can determine if the lung cancer history in your husband's family is due to a genetic predisposition.  A genetic test can identify a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which are known to increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer as well as some types of lung cancer.  If a mutation is identified, your husband and any of his family members who are at risk may benefit from increased screening and prevention options.","1. If the genetic test shows that your husband is positive for the mutation, then he is at high risk for developing lung cancer. 2. The test can also determine whether your husband is a carrier of the mutation, meaning he has the gene but does not have the disease. If this is the case, his children will be at risk, but he will not be. 3. If the test shows that your husband does not have the mutation, then his children will not be at risk for developing lung cancer. 4. It is important to note that the genetic test only detects mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Other genes may also increase risk for developing lung cancer, but they have not yet been identified.","1. Family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. 2. The risk is higher if there is a family history of lung cancer in first degree relatives. 3. Yes, genetic testing is a viable option to assess the risk of lung cancer in your husband and his sisters, considering their mother's and her relatives' history of the disease. 4. The most common genetic mutation associated with lung cancer is EGFR. 5. Genetic testing can be done for the common mutations like EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, ALK, RET, MET, NF1, and PTEN. 6. If any of these mutations is present in the family, then genetic testing can be done for the same. 7. If any of these mutations is present in the family, then early screening and preventive measures can be taken. 8. If the genetic testing reveals that your husband or his sisters have any of these mutations, then they should avoid smoking, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. 9. The risk of lung cancer can be reduced by 50% if these individuals quit smoking at the age of 40 years."

Treatment for Friedreich ataxia is aimed at relieving symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease.  No treatment is available to cure the disease.  Drug treatments are currently being studied as a possible treatment for Friedreich ataxia.  Two drugs that are being studied are:  - Eteplirsen  - Gene therapy Friedreich ataxia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  Autosomal recessive means that two copies of the gene in each cell must be affected for the disease to develop.  If both copies of the gene are affected, the person will have the disease.  If only one copy is affected, the person will be a carrier for the disease.  A carrier will not have the disease, but may pass the gene on to his or her children.  Genetic testing can detect Friedreich ataxia when a person is still unaffected.  This testing can be done for people who are at risk for developing the disease.  Early detection of Friedreich ataxia can help reduce the risk of complications.  Research has shown that treatment may be more effective when it is started early.","1.

Small bowel ischemia and reperfusion syndrome is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. 2. Prompt diagnosis and immediate surgical exploration are the keys to successful treatment. 3. Delay in diagnosis and surgical exploration leads to irreversible intestinal injury and usually results in a fatal outcome. 4. Intestinal reperfusion leads to a reperfusion syndrome that is associated with increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in bacterial translocation and systemic sepsis. 5. The best chance of a successful outcome occurs when the bowel is revascularized before irreversible damage occurs.","1) Bowel ischemia is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid intervention. 2) The decision to operate is based on clinical picture, but imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis. 3) Bowel resection, anastomosis, stoma formation, and other surgical procedures may be necessary. 4) Post-operative care includes monitoring for complications, wound care, and physical therapy. 5) Prognosis depends on the extent of the damage and the patient's overall health.","1.

It can affect the heart, legs, feet, shoulders, arms, and other muscles. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. However, medications and physical therapy may help to lessen the effects of the disease.  In addition, people with muscular dystrophy often need assistive devices such as braces, walkers, or wheelchairs.  Research has identified many possible approaches to treating these diseases. Clinical trials on promising treatments are under way.","1. The implications of muscular dystrophy on your heart, legs, feet, shoulders, arms, and other areas of your body will depend on the specific type of muscular dystrophy that you have. 2. The severity of these problems also will depend on how advanced the disease is when it is first diagnosed. 3. In general, people with muscular dystrophy experience progressive weakness in the muscles responsible for movement. 4. This weakness eventually may lead to serious problems in the heart and lungs. 5. Medical treatments for muscular dystrophy are aimed at slowing the progress of weakness and disease. 6.

Physical therapy and exercise are important parts of treatment. 4. Orthopedic devices such as braces may be used to treat deformities. 5. Some patients may need wheelchairs.","1. Heart Problems: People with muscular dystrophy often develop heart disease because the muscle in the heart is weakened. This can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles. Some people with muscular dystrophy develop irregular heartbeats, which can be life-threatening. 2. Leg Problems: As the muscles in the legs weaken, it becomes increasingly difficult to walk. The calf muscles, which are responsible for heel walking and toe walking, begin to shrink (waste). This causes the muscle in the back of the leg to lengthen, which can pull the heel into a downward position (equinus) and push the foot into a position of being turned inward (varus). This can make it very difficult to wear regular shoes. As the disease progresses, the muscles in the feet weaken, making it difficult to walk on the toes or walk upstairs. 3. Shoulder and Arm Problems: Weakness in the shoulder muscles can make it difficult to reach overhead or to push objects away from the body. As the disease progresses, the shoulder muscles become very weak and the shoulder loses its rounded contour. The shoulder joint becomes unstable, making it difficult to move the arm. The weakness in the muscles of the arms can make it difficult to carry heavy objects or to open jars and bottles. 4. Other Areas of the Body: As the muscles of the body weaken, it becomes increasingly difficult to do everyday activities, such as getting up from a chair, lifting objects, buttoning a shirt, or combing hair. The muscles of the neck may become weak, causing the head to tilt to one side. The muscles of the digestive system may weaken, causing swallowing difficulties and constipation. The muscles of the hands may weaken, making it difficult to grip objects. The weakness in the muscles of the pelvic area may make it difficult to control urination and to have bowel movements."

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic condition that results in fragile, easily broken bones. It is one of a group of disorders known as osteoporosis. In OI, the body produces defective collagen, which is a major component of bone. 2. People with OI are born with a defect in the gene that produces type 1 collagen, which is the main protein used in bone, cartilage, ligaments, and skin. 3. There are four types of OI, Types I through IV. Type I is the mildest form of the disease and Type IV is the most severe form. 4. A baby's bones are soft and brittle at birth. As the child grows, the bones become stronger. The severity of OI varies from person to person. Some people have a mild form of the disease and can lead fairly normal lives.

It is also important to follow dietary guidelines and exercise regularly."
"1. You have mentioned that you have been suffering from burning mouth syn PMC-LLaMA. 2. The burning can be in tongue, gums, cheeks, floor of the mouth or the soft palate. 3. The burning is usually very uncomfortable and can be constant and severe. 4. The exact cause of the burning is not known. It is thought that a lack of saliva may be the cause. 5. The burning can also be caused by other problems such as: - A reaction to a medication - Stress 6. Your doctor may order tests to see if the burning is related to a lack of saliva or to one of the other problems. 7. Burning mouth syn","The researchers found that the condition is caused by a protein called alpha-synuclein that accumulates in nerve cells in the tongue. The protein is a major component of Lewy bodies - the deposits found in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.  The team also discovered that a drug that blocks the production of alpha-synuclein - called an alpha-synuclein inhibitor - could prevent the condition in mice.  The researchers hope their findings could lead to the development of a drug to treat the condition in humans.  ""This is a real possibility,"" says senior author Dr. Marcia Nahikian. ""We are working very hard to develop a small molecule that will be taken orally to treat this condition. It will be a few years before this treatment is available, but we're hopeful that we can get something that will help these patients.""","1) The prevalence of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is unknown, but it is estimated to be between 1 and 10 cases per 100,000 people. 2) BMS is more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is 50 years. 3) The etiology of BMS is unknown, but it is believed to be multifactorial with both psychologic and organic factors playing a role. 4) Psychologic factors thought to contribute to BMS include depression, anxiety, stress, and coping mechanisms. 5) Organic factors that have been implicated in the etiology of BMS include hormone deficiencies (e.g., estrogen), autoimmune disorders, allergies, and nutritional deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12, folate, and iron). 6) The diagnosis of BMS is based on clinical signs and symptoms. 7) The differential diagnosis includes local and/or systemic infection, mucosal lesions, candidiasis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, herpes simplex virus, allergy, deficiency states, and neuropathy. 8) Current treatment of BMS is based on symptoms. 9) Topical therapy includes compounds that are thought to be deficient in patients with BMS (e.g., vitamins A, D, and E; and essential fatty acids). 10) Systemic therapy includes medications such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and anti-convulsants. 11) The treatment of BMS should also include behavioral modifications (e.g., relaxation techniques, stress management, and biofeedback). 12) The prognosis of BMS is unknown.","The treatment we are proposing is already available and has been used in humans.  However, its safety and efficacy has not been established for the treatment of burning mouth syndrome.  We propose to conduct a clinical trial to establish these parameters.  We expect the trial to be completed in 3 years.",1. The present study suggests that burning mouth syndrome is a neuropathic pain disorder. 2. The underlying mechanism of burning mouth syndrome is peripheral sensitization of nerve fibers. 3. The results of this study will help to develop new treatment strategies for burning mouth syndrome. 4. The new treatment options will be available in 5-7 years according to the timeline of drug development.,"Hi, Welcome to PMC-LLaMA forum.  The treatment is already in use in many countries.  The treatment is in use in many countries like USA, Canada, Japan, Korea etc. It is not available in India as of now.  We are in the process of getting it approved by the regulatory authorities.  Once we get the approval, we will market it in India through our own manufacturing unit.  We will also approach the government to include it in their list of essential medicines so that it can be made available at subsidized rates to the poor patients.  Wishing you good health."

"1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). This disease is also known as type 2 renal tubular acidosis or RTA II. 2. There are two types of distal renal tubular acidosis: Proximal dominant and Distal dominant. Proximal dominant RTA is more common. Distal dominant RTA is rare and occurs in fewer than one percent of all patients with RTA. 3. The cause of distal renal tubular acidosis is often unknown. In some cases, the condition is inherited. 4. Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis are similar to those of other types of RTA and include: 5. Treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis is based on the patient's symptoms and may include sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium citrate to help correct the acidosis and prevent bone disease. 6. If distal renal tubular acidosis is caused by another condition, treatment of that condition may help control the acidosis.","1) Distal renal tubular acidosis is a condition in which the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 2) Treatment for distal renal tubular acidosis may include potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate to help increase the amount of bicarbonate in the blood. 3) Avoiding acidic foods and beverages may also help improve symptoms.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a disorder characterized by a defect in the kidney's ability to acidify urine, resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). 3. There are several different types of distal renal tubular acidosis. The most common form is type 1, which is also called classic distal renal tubular acidosis. 4. Some cases of distal renal tubular acidosis occur because of a problem with the gene that makes a protein called carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2). 5. The CA2 protein is active in many parts of the body, but its main job is to help with acidification in the kidneys. 6. When the CA2 gene is altered, the protein it makes does not work well, which causes distal renal tubular acidosis. 7. Researchers have identified more than 100 different mutations in the CA2 gene that can lead to distal renal tubular acidosis. These mutations disrupt the function of the CA2 protein in different ways, which can affect how severely a person is affected. 8. In some cases, people have a mutation in both copies of the CA2 gene. In other cases, one copy of the CA2 gene has a mutation while the other copy does not. 9. Researchers have also identified mutations in other genes that can lead to distal renal tubular acidosis. These genes are involved in the function of the CA2 protein. 10. Distal renal tubular acidosis can also be caused by autoimmune disorders. In these cases, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the kidneys, which leads to the disorder. 11. Some cases of distal renal tubular acidosis occur because of a problem with the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone is made by the adrenal glands and plays an important role in regulating the balance of sodium and potassium in the body.","1. Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease characterized by the inability of the kidneys to properly remove excess acid from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis). This condition is also known as type 2 A or A2. 2. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys do not respond to the aldosterone hormone. As a result, the kidneys are not able to reabsorb sodium (sodium reabsorption). 3. The kidneys normally reabsorb sodium and other ions, and return them to the blood. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys fail to return sodium to the blood. This causes an increase in the amount of sodium in the urine (called sodium wasting). 4. In addition, the kidneys normally increase the amount of potassium in the urine when too much acid is present in the blood. In distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys fail to increase the amount of potassium in the urine (called potassium wasting). 5. Individuals with distal renal tubular acidosis are at risk for developing: - kidney stones - bone disease (such as osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and osteopenia) - high levels of potassium in the blood - high levels of acid in the blood - kidney failure 6. Causes of distal renal tubular acidosis may include: - autoimmune disorders (such as Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis) - inherited conditions (such as Alport syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and nephronophthisis) - obstructive uropathy (such as from kidney stones, sickle cell disease, and polycystic kidney disease) - medications (such as acetazolamide, amphotericin B, ifosfamide, and topiramate) 7. Distal renal tubular acidosis is often diagnosed after a blood test that checks the levels of acid in the blood.","1.

There are several types of distal renal tubular acidosis. In some cases, the condition is caused by an inherited genetic mutation. In other cases, it may be triggered by another condition, such as chronic kidney disease or diabetes. 3. The symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis can vary from person to person. Some people have no symptoms. Others may have symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. 4. The diagnosis is based on a blood test that measures the level of acid in the blood. Other tests may be done to determine the cause of the condition. 5. Treatment may include taking potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. In severe cases, dialysis may be needed. 6.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long term (chronic) disease characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function. It is a common condition, affecting 1 in 9 adults. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes, high blood pressure, and glomerulonephritis (a group of diseases that cause inflammation of the filtering units in the kidneys). 2. The kidneys are responsible for filtering wastes and extra fluid from your blood. When the kidneys are damaged, they are not able to remove the wastes and fluid, which can build up in your blood and cause problems. 3. As the kidneys stop working, waste builds up in the body causing complications such as anemia (low red blood cell count), bone disease, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, confusion, and swelling. 4. CKD can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as kidney failure. ESRD occurs when the kidneys no longer work to remove wastes and fluid from your blood. Without treatment, people with ESRD die. 5. Treatment for CKD includes medicines, dietary changes, and dialysis or kidney transplantation.","1.

They can be contact poisons, stomach poisons, fumigants, and space sprays. Contact poisons are applied directly to the bodies of insects and are effective only on those insects that come in contact with the poison. Stomach poisons are taken into the insect's body through the mouth and kill the insect after a period of feeding. Fumigants are gases or vapors that are introduced into buildings or other enclosed areas to kill insects. They are especially effective against moths and beetles. Space sprays are general insecticides that are applied as a mist or fog to kill insects by contact and by stomach poisoning. 2. Traps: Traps are devices that use color, chemicals, and/or heat to lure insects. Once the insects are in the trap, they are killed by dehydration or by exposure to fumes. Traps are effective only in the immediate area around the trap. 3. Biological controls: Biological controls involve the use of natural enemies of insects to kill pests. Biological controls include the use of predators and parasites that feed on insect pests. Biological controls also include the use of insect-eating bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 4. Destruction of breeding areas: If the breeding areas for insects can be destroyed, the insect population can be greatly reduced. 5. Protective measures: Protective measures include the use of pesticides and repellents. Pesticides are chemicals that are used to kill insects. Repellents are substances that prevent insects from feeding on plants or animals. 6. Cultural controls: Cultural controls include the use of natural and synthetic methods to reduce the number of insects. Examples of cultural controls include flooding areas to prevent mosquitoes from breeding and the use of crops that are resistant to insect feeding. 7.

Examples of cultural control include flooding areas to prevent mosquitoes from breeding and the use of crops that are resistant to insect feeding.","1) The best way to get rid of mice is to prevent them from getting food and shelter in your home. Keeping your home clean and free of food scraps is very important. 2) Traps are the most common method used to get rid of mice. There are many types of traps, such as the traditional wooden snap trap, the multiple catch trap, and the humane trap. 3) Mice are nocturnal animals, so they will mostly be active at night when you are asleep. Therefore, it is best to set traps at night. 4) Bait should be placed about 6 inches away from the trap so that the mouse has to cross two surfaces to get to the bait. This increases the chance that the mouse will trigger the trap. 5) Traps should be checked at least once a day to see if they have caught a mouse. If they have, then the mouse should be disposed of. 6) If the mice are a recurring problem, then it may be necessary to call an exterminator."

The person will need to take medication for the rest of their life to prevent the new liver from being rejected.11. Chelating agents (such as penicillamine) stop the body from absorbing excess copper.12. They are usually taken for life.13. Zinc acetate can be used instead of penicillamine if penicillamine is not tolerated.14. The person will need to have regular blood tests to monitor the levels of copper in their body.15. Zinc acetate stops the body from absorbing excess copper, but it does not remove excess copper from the body.16. Removing copper from the body is usually done using a medication called EDTA.17. EDTA is only used in emergencies and must be given intravenously (through a vein).18. EDTA is not suitable for long-term use and can have side effects.19. The aim of treatment is to prevent damage to the body from accumulating copper and to reduce any existing damage.20. Treatment","1. Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the body. 2. The only FDA approved medication for Wilson disease is called Trientine. 3. If Trientine is not an option for your son, then you can consider going for a liver transplant which is the definitive treatment for this disease. 4. In case your son has symptoms like tremors, slurring of speech, or problems with coordination, he may need to take medications such as Penicillamine or Zinc Acetate. 5. You can also consult with a genetic counselor to determine if other family members may be at risk for this disease.","1. You should know that Wilson disease is an inherited disorder in which copper builds up in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. 2. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the body. 3. Treatment for Wilson disease typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. 4. Medications include: - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) - Trientine (Syprine) - Zinc acetate (Galzin) - Liver transplantation 5. Lifestyle changes include avoiding foods high in copper, such as: - Shellfish - Nuts - Chocolate - Liver - Mushrooms 6. Your son will also need regular blood tests to monitor his copper levels.","1) Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the body. 2) The disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. 3) The following symptoms are associated with Wilson's disease: - jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) - liver disease - abnormalities in the structure or function of the brain - abnormalities in the structure or function of the thyroid gland - kidney problems - psychiatric disorders - unexplained developmental delays or loss of developmental skills 4) Wilson's disease is diagnosed with a combination of blood tests and a liver biopsy. 5) Treatment includes medications to remove excess copper from the body and to prevent further copper accumulation. 6) Without treatment, Wilson's disease can be fatal.","1.

"1. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form of TSD is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A (HEXA). Without this enzyme, a fatty substance, or lipid, called GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. This accumulation causes progressive damage to the cells and leads to the symptoms of TSD. TSD is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both copies of the gene must be altered for symptoms to develop. In most cases, both parents of a child with an autosomal recessive condition are unaffected carriers of the altered gene, and have one copy of the altered gene in their genetic makeup. In some cases, one parent may have the condition while the other parent is an unaffected carrier of the altered gene. If both parents are carriers of the altered gene, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that their child will develop the condition. TSD is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. The term ""Tay-Sachs"" refers to the two researchers who first described the disease in 1881. 2. Tay-Sachs disease is not preventable at this time. 3. Tay-Sachs disease affects 1 in 300,000 people in the United States. The incidence is higher among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, in which 1 in 250 people are carriers. 4. The National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) is a non-profit organization that provides information and support for individuals and families affected by Tay-Sachs and other genetic diseases. NTSAD offers a wide variety of services, including patient registration, patient and family support, educational materials, research and professional programs, and referrals to genetic counseling and treatment centers. NTSAD also maintains a website at http://www.ntsad.org and can be reached by phone at 8","Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is most common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The first signs of the disease usually appear around four to six months of age. These signs include:      vision difficulties     lack of muscle coordination     mental retardation     seizures     blindness     paralysis     feeding difficulties and     recurrent respiratory infections.  Babies with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age four.  There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, but medications may help control some of the symptoms.  People with Tay-Sachs disease are unable to process a special chemical (called a ganglioside) that is found in the brain and nerve tissues. This chemical helps nerve cells work properly.  Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. The defective gene causes the body to make abnormal ganglioside.  About 1 in 25 members of the Ashkenazi Jewish population carry the defective Tay-Sachs gene. Two blood tests can check for the defective gene or the abnormal ganglioside. One test is usually done before a baby is born. The other test checks people at any age.  There is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease. However, medications may help control some of the symptoms. Specialized care can help individuals live as long as possible.","1. Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Treatment for clubfoot includes manipulation, taping, and bracing. Most children respond to this treatment within three months. If this treatment does not work, serial casting may be done. This is a procedure in which the foot is manipulated and then held in place with a cast. The cast is changed every week. This procedure may take up to six months. If serial casting does not work, surgery may be required.","Tay-Sachs disease (GTS) is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This deficiency results in the accumulation of a fatty substance in the brain and nerve tissues, which progressively destroys nerve cells. GTS is characterized by mental and physical retardation, blindness, and muscular weakness. Most infants with GTS do not live beyond four years of age.  Clubfoot is a congenital condition in which one or both feet turn inward and downward. The cause of clubfoot is not known, but researchers suspect that it results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Clubfoot is treated with casting and/or surgery.

"1. Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia (HLT) is characterized by congenital hypotrichosis, multiple telangiectasia and localized or generalized lymphedema. Patients may also present with associated anomalies such as nail dystrophy, onychodystrophy, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, syndactyly and/or visceral malformations. 2. Mutations in the SOX18 gene have been identified in patients with HLT. The SOX18 gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the high mobility group (HMG) box family. This gene is specifically expressed in the developing lymphatic system and plays a role in the regulation of several genes involved in lymphangiogenesis. 3. The SOX18 protein has also been shown to play a role in the maintenance of the hair cycle. Since more than 50% of patients with HLT present with hair thinning and/or alopecia, it has been suggested that mutations in SOX18 could be responsible for the hair phenotype observed in these patients. 4. The main treatments are symptomatic and supportive. Treatment for lymphedema includes elevation of the extremity, use of compression garments, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.

"1. 165 is too high for a fasting blood sugar.  You should check with your doctor for the possibility of insulin resistance or diabetes. 2. Check your blood sugar 2 hours after a meal to see how high it goes up. 3. Do not eat any sweets or starches (bread, potatoes, rice, etc.) for 3 days, then eat a piece of fruit and see how your blood sugar goes up.

You should have a healthy diet low in sugar and carboy PMC-LLaMA.  Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes. Avoid stress. Check your blood sugar after 15 days. If it is still high, then you need to start antidiabetic","1) You should be aware that blood sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day. This is due to a variety of factors including activity level, diet, and medication. 2) The most common cause of an elevated fasting blood glucose is Dawn Phenomenon. This is a normal biological process that occurs in people with diabetes. When you are sleeping, your body is producing less glucose and therefore your blood glucose levels are lower. As you start to wake up and become more active, your body starts to produce more glucose, which can cause an increase in your blood glucose levels. 3) Another common cause of an elevated fasting blood glucose is Somogyi Effect. This is when the body produces too much insulin in response to a low blood glucose level, which causes the blood glucose to drop even lower. As the body tries to restore balance, it produces more insulin, causing the blood glucose to rise. 4) To help prevent the early morning spike in blood glucose, you can try the following: a) Check your blood sugar before bed. If it is high (over 140 mg/dL), you can take an extra dose of insulin to prevent the spike in the morning. b) Exercise in the morning. This can help to burn off excess glucose and prevent a spike in blood glucose. c) Eat dinner earlier in the evening. This will allow more time for your body to digest the food before you go to bed. d) Avoid carbohydrate-rich foods at dinner. e) Eat a small snack before bed.

"1. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when your body cannot effectively use the sugar (glucose) in your blood. 2. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver. Glucose is the main source of energy for your body's cells.3. Your blood carries the glucose to all of your body's cells, but the cells can only use glucose if it is available to them in the bloodstream. To get glucose into your bloodstream, your body produces a hormone called insulin. Insulin allows the glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the cells.4. In people with diabetes, this does not happen. Either the body doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin that is made doesn't work as well as it should. 5. Glucose stays in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells, so the amount of glucose in the bloodstream increases.6. High blood sugar levels can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, heart, eyes, feet, and other parts of the body. This damage may lead to pain, organ failure, and other serious problems.7. There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.8. Type 1 diabetes, also called insulin-dependent diabetes, is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin.9. In type 2 diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body usually produces insulin, but the insulin that is produced does not work as well as it should. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes.10. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.11. If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver. Glucose is the main source of energy for your body's cells.12. Your blood carries the glucose to all of your body's cells, but the cells can only use glucose if it is available to them in the blood","1. The pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, which helps glucose enter the cells and be used for energy. In people with diabetes, the pancreas produces less insulin or the body does not effectively use the insulin that is produced. Glucose remains in the bloodstream, and excess glucose is stored in the liver and extra fat is stored in the body. 2. The urine bladder becomes heavier because of increased urine production due to increased glucose in the bloodstream. This excess glucose is being excreted in the urine.","1. The brain, stomach, and urine bladder are organs that are very active metabolically and have a high rate of glucose utilization. The reason that these organs have such a high glucose utilization is that they have a very high rate of energy expenditure due to their activity. 2. The urine bladder gains more weight than other body parts because it is constantly being filled with urine, which stretches the bladder wall, thereby increasing its mass.","1. The pancreas in a diabetic patient does not produce insulin, or produces only a small amount of insulin. Insulin is needed to allow glucose to enter cells. Without insulin, glucose remains in the blood. High levels of glucose spill into the urine because the kidneys cannot reabsorb all the glucose. The extra glucose in the urine increases the volume of urine. As a result, the bladder has to work harder to pump urine out of the body. 2. The brain cannot use glucose without insulin. As a result, the brain must use alternative sources of energy, such as fats and proteins. This metabolism produces waste products that are normally excreted by the kidneys. Because the kidneys are busy reabsorbing glucose, they cannot adequately excrete the waste products, which may build up in the blood. These waste products may affect the function of the brain.","1. High blood sugar levels stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which is stored in the liver. When the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream, it also releases some into the poal system to be stored in the stomach and intestines. The intestines can absorb glucose directly from the intestinal lumen, but the stomach cannot. However, the stomach can absorb fructose and other sugars. 2. The urinary bladder is a diverticulum of the intestinal tract, and so it shares some of the same properties as the intestines. It can absorb glucose directly from the urinary lumen, and it can absorb fructose and other sugars. 3. The brain cannot absorb glucose directly from the cerebral lumen because it has no glucose transporter proteins on its surface. However, the brain contains a protein called GLUT, which is a glucose transporter protein that is similar to the ones found in the intestines and kidneys. The GLUT protein found in the brain is not able to absorb fructose and other sugars. 4. The extra weight in the urinary bladder comes from the absorption of glucose and fructose from the urinary lumen.",1. The urinary bladder has a more intimate relationship with the regulation of blood sugar levels in diabetes patients than other body parts. 2. The urinary bladder is more prone to weight gain compared to other body parts.
"1. The condition is known as Trimethylaminuria and not TMAU. 2. Trimethylaminuria is a rare inherited genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of the body. It is characterized by the presence of an offensive body odor that smells like rotten fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. 3. The condition is caused due to a defect in the Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene. 4. FMO3 gene mutation leads to the reduced activity of the enzyme which normally breaks down trimethylamine (TMA) in the body. 5. As a result, TMA accumulates in the body and is released through the urine and sweat causing the typical odor. 6. The condition is passed on in families (inherited) and is more common in people with a family history of the condition. 7. There is no cure for trimethylaminuria and the odor can persist throughout life. 8. Treatments that have been suggested for trimethylaminuria include:  - Dietary changes  - Bathing more frequently  - Wearing loose-fitting cotton clothing  - Avoiding foods that contain high amounts of trimethylamine (e.g., eggs, fish, dried beans, and peas)  - Taking antibiotics (for secondary bacterial infections)  - Taking activated charcoal tablets  - Taking chlorhexidine body washes  - Taking probiotics  - Taking vitamin B supplements 9.

Future perspectives.,"1. What is trimethylaminuria (TMAU)? Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a condition characterised by an offensive body odour that smells like rotting fish, faeces or garbage. It is caused by a fault in the body's natural defence system against odours. The fault prevents the body from breaking down trimethylamine (TMA), a chemical that is produced in the gut when certain choline-rich foods are digested. 2. What causes TMAU? Trimethylaminuria is caused by a fault in the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene. This gene provides the body with the instructions for making the Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 protein, which is responsible for breaking down TMA. People with TMAU either have a complete absence of the FMO3 protein or have an enzyme that does not work properly. 3. How common is TMAU? TMAU is a rare condition and affects approximately one in 50,000 people in the UK. It occurs in males and females in equal numbers. 4. What are the symptoms of TMAU? Trimethylaminuria is characterised by an offensive body odour that smells like rotting fish, faeces or garbage. The odour is caused by a build-up of TMA in the body. People with TMAU often describe the smell as being 'fishy' or 'like rotting eggs'. Other symptoms of TMAU include: - Fatigue - Depression - Social isolation - Low self-esteem - Neglect - Rage - Feelings of hopelessness 5. How is TMAU diagnosed? Trimethylaminuria is diagnosed using a combination of: - A detailed medical history - Genetic testing - Blood tests 6. What is the treatment for TMAU? There is currently no cure for TMAU. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of the condition. This includes: - Dietary changes - Supplements - Treating any co-existing conditions, such as depression 7. What is gene therapy? Gene therapy is a technique used to treat or prevent disease by changing the DNA of a patient","1. There is no specific treatment for trimethylaminuria (TMAU). Some people find that their symptoms improve with use of an antiseptic soap, such as Zephiran, or a soap-less cleansing product, such as Taclone. 2. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a genetic disorder. In some cases, the condition can be improved by treating the underlying condition. 3. Some people with TMAU respond to treatment with high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This treatment is mainly used for people with a metabolic disorder called pyridoxine-5-phosphate oxidase deficiency, which causes TMAU symptoms very similar to those of TMAU without any known genetic cause. 4. In rare cases, people with TMAU may benefit from a low-protein diet. Avoiding certain foods that contain amino acids (the building blocks of protein) may reduce the odor associated with TMAU. These foods include: meat fish chicken eggs cheese soybean products nuts and legumes 5. There is no cure for TMAU. Treatment is aimed at reducing the odor caused by trimethylamine, and improving the patient's quality of life."

Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is aware and awake, but cannot move or communicate due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. 3. The patient is fully conscious and aware of his/her surroundings but is unable to speak or make any other sounds, and is only able to move his/her eyes. 4. The patient is immobile and can only communicate through eye blinks or through use of a computer for communication. 5. It is caused due to a number of medical conditions, such as a stroke, a brain tumor, or a car accident. 6. In rare cases, locked-in syndrome can result from a disease or injury that affects the nerves and locks the patient inside his/her own body. 7. There is no cure for locked-in syndrome, but some therapies may help improve the patient's quality of life. 8. Please tell me the diagnosis of your brother and the location, so that I can guide you.","Yes, there are several organizations and support groups who can provide assistance for people with locked-in syndrome.

"1. Stroke survivors should always be under the care of a neurologist.2. The treatment depends on the type of stroke, the cause of the stroke, the extent of brain damage, the age and health of the patient, and the level of care available.3. Strokes are usually classified by their cause (ischemic or hemorrhagic).4. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting for 87% of all strokes. 5. There are two types of ischemic stroke: atherosclerosis-related and cardioembolic.6. Atherosclerosis-related strokes are the most common form of ischemic stroke and account for 80% to 90% of all ischemic strokes.7. Cardioembolic strokes account for 15% to 20% of all strokes and are caused by blood clots that form on the wall of the heart and then break off and travel to the brain.8. In rare cases, strokes can be caused by a sudden decrease in blood flow to the brain, usually as a result of a ruptured aneurysm, an abnormality in the blood vessels of the brain, or a hematoma (collection of blood in the brain).9. The treatment for a stroke depends on the type of stroke, the extent of brain damage, and the patient's age and overall health.10. The most effective treatment for stroke is prevention.11. Risk factors for stroke can be controlled or modified.12. These risk factors include high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise and obesity.13. In the event that a stroke occurs, the sooner treatment is received, the greater the chance of a good outcome.14. The most effective treatment for stroke is prevention.15.

"1. The risk of recurrence of a genetic disorder depends on the mode of inheritance of the disease.2. If the disease is caused by a single gene mutation following Mendelian inheritance (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive), the risk of recurrence is high.3. If the disease is caused by a chromosomal abnormality or a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern, the risk of recurrence is low.4. In most cases, it is not possible to accurately predict the recurrence risk of genetic disorders.5. Genetic counseling is recommended to obtain more information about the disease, its inheritance pattern, and the risk of recurrence.","Yes, some individuals with a family history of Lou Gehrig's disease may have a genetic change (mutation) that causes the disorder. If you have a sibling with Lou Gehrig's disease, you may have as high as a 25 percent chance of having or passing on the disorder to your children.","1. You have a family history of Lou Gehrig's disease. 2. It is possible for other siblings to display some symptoms of the condition. 3. You should know that there is no cure for the disease and the treatment is symptomatic. 4. You should avoid contact sports like football, soccer etc. 5. You should avoid strenuous exercise like running, hiking, swimming etc. 6. You should avoid lifting heavy weights. 7. You should avoid climbing stairs. 8. You should avoid PMC-LLaMA.","1. Yes, there is a possibility that you may have some symptoms of the disease. 2. But, since you are asymptomatic, you are not likely to have the disease. 3. You can get tested for the disease if you want to confirm that you do not have the disease.","1. Loss of brothers or sisters is distressing. It is important to know that the risk of recurrence of a genetic condition in siblings is dependent on the mode of inheritance of the condition.2. If the condition is due to a single gene mutation (Mendelian inheritance) the risk of recurrence is the same for all siblings.3. If the condition is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (polygenic inheritance) the risk of recurrence is determined by the genetic makeup of the parents as well as environmental factors.4. If the condition is due to chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy) the risk of recurrence is dependent on the type of abnormality.5. In case of lethal conditions such as Louis Bar Syndrome, the risk of recurrence is zero.","1. Yes, other siblings like you can exhibit a range of symptoms, from mild to severe.2. The severity of the disease varies among affected individuals.3. Some people have very mild symptoms while others have more severe symptoms.4. Symptoms can include intellectual disability, developmental delay, muscle stiffness, awkward movements, and seizures.5. People with the condition usually have a normal lifespan."
1) People don't clench their fists during sleep because it is not an action that the brain has evolved to control. The brain has evolved to control the muscles of mastication (the muscles of the jaw). 2) The jaw is the most common location for clenching because it is the most accessible muscle. It is the only muscle in the body that is always attached to bone (the mandible) and can therefore be clenched at any time.,"1. The jaw is the most common location for bruxism because of the unique anatomy of the jaw and the absence of a protective cushion of soft tissues between the teeth. 2. The mandible is the only bone in the body that is suspended by muscles, with no cushioning soft tissue between the teeth and the muscle. 3. The temporomandibular joint is the only joint in the body that has no cushioning soft tissues between the bones. This combination of factors makes the jaw the most common location for bruxism.","1. Sleep bruxism is a parafunctional activity, which means that it is an activity that should not occur during sleep. Sleep bruxism may occur during any stage of sleep, but it is most common during stage N1 sleep. 2. The exact etiology of sleep bruxism is unknown. There are several theories about the origin of bruxism. One of the most accepted theories today is the ""stress theory"". It postulates that sleep bruxism is a stress-related phenomenon. Sleep bruxism is frequently associated with other parafunctional activities such as snoring, talking, and body movements. 3. During sleep, the jaw muscles and the muscles of mastication are in a state of slight contraction. If the contraction becomes more intense, sleep bruxism may occur. Sleep bruxism is usually not associated with pain in the jaw or teeth. However, if it continues for a long time, it may lead to jaw disorders, headaches, and other problems. 4. Sleep bruxism is usually not treated unless it causes significant problems. Several treatments are available. The most commonly used treatments are oral appliances, such as mouth guards, which are thought to disrupt the grinding pattern. Medications such as benzodiazepines may be used to help relax the jaw muscles. Psychological counseling may also be used to help determine the source of stress and find ways to cope with it.","1) The masseter muscle is one of the strongest muscles in the body. 2) The masseter muscle is one of the most consistently used muscles in the body. 3) The masseter muscle is located very close to the surface of the skin, which makes it easier for the bruxism habit to be noticed. 4) The masseter muscle is located very close to the TMJ, which can make it more difficult to distinguish between bruxism and TMJ dysfunction. 5) The masseter muscle is located underneath the zygomatic arch, which can make it more difficult to distinguish between bruxism and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.",1. Bruxism is a parafunctional activity associated with stress.2. It is associated with abnormal occlusal contact.3. It is associated with abnormal posture.4. It is associated with psychological factors.5. It is associated with abnormal sleep patterns.6. It is associated with altered circadian rhythms.7. It is associated with altered levels of melatonin.8. It is associated with altered levels of catecholamines.9. It is associated with altered levels of prostaglandins.,"1. The jaw is one of the most frequently used muscle groups. 2. It is a complex group of muscles, and the muscles are constantly in motion during chewing, speaking, and other activities. 3. It is the only muscle group in the body that is constantly in motion during waking hours. 4. It is adjacent to the ear, which may be a factor in the origin of the disorder."

You are on the right track with CBT and mindfulness. 2. Insomnia can be a result of anxiety, stress, or depression. 3. It can also be due to medications, caffeine, alcohol, or other substances. 4. It can be due to poor sleep habits and practices such as staying up late or going to bed too early. 5. Insomnia can also be related to medical conditions, such as restless leg syndrome or a cold or sinus infection. 6. If you are having trouble falling asleep, you may benefit from a relaxation exercise such as deep breathing or meditation before bed. 7. Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco for at least 3 to 4 hours before bedtime. 8. When you are trying to fall asleep, don't toss and turn for too long. Instead, get out of bed and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy. 9. Try to schedule your sleep time to coincide with your biological clock. 10. Exercise regularly for better sleep.","1. Insomnia can be a symptom of an underlying mental health disorder, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.2. It can also be a side effect of certain medications, such as steroids or asthma medications.3. It can be caused by a medical condition, such as restless leg syndrome or sleep apnea.4. Lifestyle factors, such as caffeine or alcohol use, poor sleep habits, or a high-stress job, can also cause or worsen insomnia.5. In some cases, insomnia may have no identifiable cause.","1) Chronic insomnia can have multiple causes including psychological distress, medications, substance use, medical conditions, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and other sleep disorders; 2) Psychological distress is a common cause of insomnia, and in your case, it is possible that your social anxiety is contributing to your insomnia; 3) To determine if social anxiety is contributing to your insomnia, I would recommend that you keep a sleep diary for a week or two to track your sleep patterns, when you experience social anxiety, and any other symptoms you experience that might be related to your anxiety; 4) You might also consider keeping a log of your caffeine and alcohol intake, as these can affect sleep; 5) Once you have this information, you can share it with your psychiatrist and/or psychologist to help determine if social anxiety is contributing to your insomnia and, if so, how to best treat it.","1. Chronic insomnia is a common comorbidity with social anxiety disorder.2. There are many potential causes of insomnia in patients with social anxiety disorder, including performance anxiety, worry, and anticipatory anxiety regarding work, school, or social interactions. 3. It is important to assess for other potential causes of insomnia, such as medical disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism, restless legs syndrome), medication side effects, and substance use (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, tobacco).4. Treatment of social anxiety disorder often includes medication and/or psychotherapy. Medication options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) includes exposure, relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring.","1) Insomnia is a symptom, not a disorder in itself. It is a common symptom of many psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. It can also be caused by certain medical conditions or factors such as medications, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and poor sleep habits. 2) I would recommend that you discuss your insomnia with your psychiatrist and ask for a referral to a sleep specialist. A sleep specialist will be able to perform an evaluation to determine the cause of your insomnia. This will most likely include a thorough sleep history, physical examination, and possibly a sleep study (polysomnography). 3) Treatment of insomnia will depend on the underlying cause. If your insomnia is related to another disorder, treatment of that disorder may improve your sleep. If you have poor sleep habits, your sleep specialist may recommend changes to your sleep schedule, environment, or routine. In some cases, medication may be used to improve sleep."

Plavix (clopidogrel) is used to prevent heart attack, stroke, or other serious conditions in people who have a high risk of these events. This medication is also used to prevent blood clots in people who have been treated with an atherectomy procedure (a procedure to remove fatty deposits from the walls of blood vessels). Clopidogrel is called a platelet inhibitor. Platelets are small blood cells that help form blood clots. Clopidogrel prevents platelets from forming clots. This helps prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other serious conditions. Clopidogrel is taken once a day. Common side effects of clopidogrel include: skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. Taking aspirin and clopidogrel together can increase the risk of bleeding. 2. Linisopril is used to treat high blood pressure. Linisopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of a substance that causes blood vessels to constrict (get narrower). When blood vessels constrict, blood pressure goes up. 3. Simvastatin is used to lower blood cholesterol level to prevent heart attack, stroke, or other serious conditions. Simvastatin is called a statin. Simvastatin works by decreasing the production of a substance that causes the liver to make cholesterol, and this decreases the amount of cholesterol that may build up in the arteries. 4. Melatonin is a dietary supplement used to treat jet lag and sleep disorders. Melatonin is also used as a sleep aid and to treat insomnia. Melatonin is a natural hormone that is released from the pineal gland in the brain and helps control sleep and wakefulness. Melatonin is not available in the United States as a prescription medication. Melatonin dietary supplements are available as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.",40% of patients experience no or mild side effects of Plavix. 60% of patients experience no or mild side effects of Linisopril. 80% of patients experience no or mild side effects of Simvastatin. 50% of patients experience no or mild side effects of Melotonin.,"1.

"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). As a result, the heart muscle stiffens and becomes harder to pump blood. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain or palpitations. It can also cause life-threatening heart problems, such as sudden cardiac arrest due to an abnormal heart rhythm. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is often hereditary and is usually diagnosed in people between the ages of 10 and 30. The condition is usually diagnosed with an echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to create images of the heart. Treatment options include medications, lifestyle changes and, in some cases, surgery. 2. Cardiomyopathy - Cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem. There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - as described above. Dilated cardiomyopathy - The heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. This is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy - The heart muscle becomes stiff, making it harder for the heart to fill with blood. This can cause problems with the heart's ability to pump blood properly.",1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. 2. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. This causes the heart to lose its pumping ability.,"1) Heart conditions are of different types. It would be better if you can tell me about your sons' symptoms. 2) For heart conditions like congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Kawasaki disease, long QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, sickle cell anemia, and many more; the treatment options include medications, pacemakers, defibrillators, surgery, and transplants. 3) In addition, for some heart conditions, genetic counseling may be needed. 4) So, it would be better if you can provide me more details about your sons' symptoms so that I can guide you better.","1) Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth. But sometimes it is not diagnosed until later in life. Most often, CHD is caused by a problem during fetal development. It occurs in about 1 out of every 100 live births. 2) Heart conditions are often diagnosed using a variety of tests and procedures. These can include: An exam of the skin for signs of heart failure. An electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart. Echocardiography, which uses sound waves to create images of the heart. Cardiac catheterization, which uses a thin, flexible tube to measure pressure and oxygen levels in the heart and blood vessels. Chest x-ray. Exercise electrocardiography (stress test), which measures the heart's electrical activity while the patient is exercising.","1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only 1 part of the heart is thicker than the other parts.

"1. In the case of stroke, it is important to determine whether the stroke was ischemic (caused by a clot) or hemorrhagic (caused by a ruptured blood vessel). This can be done with a CT scan of the brain.2. Treatment for ischemic stroke depends upon the type of stroke and whether it is an acute event or a chronic disability.3. In the case of an acute event, treatment should be initiated within three hours.4. The most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke is thrombolysis, which involves the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).5. Thrombolysis is only effective within a narrow time window, however, and is not appropriate for all patients.6. In the case of chronic disability, the most effective treatment is prevention.7. This is done with antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin.8. In some cases, anticoagulation with warfarin is appropriate.9. Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke depends upon the cause and the extent of the hemorrhage.10. In the case of a sizable hemorrhage, surgical intervention may be necessary to evacuate the blood and relieve pressure on the brain.11. In the case of smaller hemorrhages or those caused by something like a tumor or an aneurysm, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause.","1) You should be screened for vasculitis, especially if you have other symptoms like joint pain, rash, fevers, etc. 2) You should get an MRI of the brain to look for multi-infarcts, which can be treated with anti-platelet agents. 3) You should have a carotid ultrasound to screen for carotid stenosis, which can be treated with stenting. 4) You should have your homocysteine levels checked, which can be treated with vitamin supplementation. 5) You should have your lipid profile checked to see if you need to be started on a statin medication. 6) You should be screened for hypercoagulable states, such as protein C or S deficiencies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, etc. 7) You should be started on aspirin, an anti-platelet agent. 8) You should be started on a statin medication.",1. You can try stem cell therapy. 2. You can try Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. 3. You can try Neurofeedback. 4. You can try Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. 5. You can try Deep brain stimulation.,1) The first alternative is to look into the possibility of a disability claim with the Veterans Administration. 2) There are other types of therapy that may work better for you than traditional stroke therapy. These include: - Remote control therapy - Functional electrical stimulation - Virtual reality - Gaming systems - Mirror therapy - Robotic therapy - Exercise programs that focus on balance and coordination.,"1. The first step is to find out if you have any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. If you have risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, it's important to manage them. 2. Your doctor will likely recommend imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, to help determine the cause of your symptoms. 3. Treatment will depend on the cause of your symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by a blood clot, your doctor may recommend medications or procedures to help dissolve or remove the clot. 4. If your symptoms are caused by a stroke, your doctor will work to minimize the damage to your brain. You may need medications to prevent seizures, reduce swelling in the brain, and control blood pressure. 5. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy can help you recover any lost functions. 6. If you've had a stroke, your doctor will work to prevent future strokes by managing your risk factors. This may involve medications to lower your blood pressure, reduce your cholesterol levels, and prevent blood clots.","1) First, you should know that stroke is a complex disease. Traditional therapies may not work for everyone. 2) There are new treatments that have been developed and are being studied in clinical trials. One such therapy is gene therapy. 3) Gene therapy is an experimental technique that aims to correct the problems in the brain caused by stroke. Researchers are testing gene therapy approaches to: 4) Improve nerve cell function 5) Prevent nerve cell death 6) Stimulate the growth of new nerve cells and connections 7) Reduce or prevent brain swelling 8) Promote blood flow in the brain 9) Stop the blood clot that caused the stroke 10) Researchers are studying gene therapy approaches to all of these problems. Some of these approaches may work alone. Others may be used together to try to treat or prevent stroke. 11) For example, researchers are testing a gene therapy approach to prevent nerve cell death by giving a gene that makes a ""nerve growth factor."" This gene is given into a specific area of the brain. Researchers are also testing gene therapy approaches to stimulate the growth of new nerve cells and connections. 12) In addition, researchers are studying gene therapy to reduce or prevent brain swelling after a stroke. They are also testing gene therapy to stop the blood clot that caused the stroke. 13) Researchers are testing gene therapy approaches to all of these problems. Some of these approaches may work alone. Others may be used together to try to treat or prevent stroke. 14) If gene therapy is used for stroke in the future, it will likely be used along with other treatments. It may be used in the hospital with a catheter or needle, or it may be given as a pill or injection. 15) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any gene therapy approaches for the treatment of stroke or its complications. Clinical trials are studying several approaches. These trials are studying the safety and effectiveness of gene therapy for stroke. 16) One day, gene therapy may be used to prevent stroke or to treat the symptoms of stroke. If you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial of gene therapy for stroke, talk to your doctor. You can also"

People with Williams Syndrome are at high risk for a condition called supravalvular aortic stenosis, which affects the flow of blood through the aorta and can cause heart problems. 7. A high-calorie diet is recommended to prevent the development of a round face and body shape. 8.

People with Williams Syndrome have a high risk of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems, especially problems with the arteries (the large blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body).  A person with Williams Syndrome also has a high risk of developing diabetes and related health problems.  Williams Syndrome is caused by a deletion of about 28 genes in the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q11.23).  Researchers think that the gene that is most likely responsible for the signs and symptoms of Williams Syndrome is the elastin gene.  Williams Syndrome affects between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 7,000 individuals.  The condition occurs in all populations, but it is more common in people of Jewish Ashkenazi descent.  Williams Syndrome is typically not inherited, because it is caused by a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in the affected person's parent.  The genetic change that causes Williams Syndrome is a random event that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in the affected person's parent.  When this genetic change or deletion occurs in the parent's egg or sperm cell, the parent has no signs or symptoms of Williams Syndrome.  When the genetic change occurs in the egg or sperm cell of the parent, it can be passed on to the parent's child.  If the person with Williams Syndrome has children, they will not have the condition, but they may be carriers.  Williams Syndrome is not inherited, but the risk of a child or grandchild being affected is 50 percent if one of the parent's egg or sperm cells carries the genetic change.

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, selective demyelination, and gliosis of CNS.  Although the exact etiology of MS is not known, it is generally accepted that the basic abnormality is an immune-mediated inflammatory response, which results in a lifelong progressive disorder with remissions and relapses. Several lines of evidence suggest that MS is caused by a breach in the immune privilege of the CNS, which results in the infiltration of T lymphocytes and other immune cells into the brain and spinal cord.  The search for a cure for MS has been a long and arduous one. However, to date, no single therapeutic agent has been found to stop the disease progression or reverse signs and symptoms in people with MS.  Although many MS therapies are available, none of them is curative; instead, they are used to control the disease course and manage symptoms.  The most effective way to reduce the impact of MS is to prevent relapses and the progression to disability through use of disease modifying agents.  The current treatment strategy is early treatment of relapses with short courses of high-dose steroids.  The most commonly used DMAs are IFN-beta and GLATI-SE.  The immunosuppressants MITOXANTIN and CYCLOSPORINE are used occasionally.  Future therapeutic approaches will include more specific immune modulators, as well as approaches that target the underlying mechanisms of inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis.  The ultimate goal is to prevent the initial trigger and/or autoimmune response that leads to MS.  The cure for MS will be found when its etiology is understood and an effective prevention strategy is implemented.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition and one which can be kept under control with medications. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are new medications which have shown good response in patients with relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. It is important to know the stage of the disease and then start treatment. Medications like ocrelizumab, omalizumab, teriflunomide, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, dalfampridine, Alemtuzumab, natalizumab are approved by FDA for treatment of multiple sclerosis. These medications have to be taken under the guidance of a neurologist. Please do not worry.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (scarring), and neuronal loss. MS commonly affects young adults and is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for MS, but several therapies can help reduce clinical relapses and slow the progression of disability. In the past few years, there has been an explosion in the number of approved therapies for treating relapsing forms of MS. This has coincided with a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of the disease and the recognition that early treatment is paramount. In addition to pharmacologic therapies, rehabilitation, nutritional counseling, and symptomatic therapies are important for patients with MS.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS).  Currently, there is no cure for MS, although some therapies may help to relieve certain symptoms.  The goals of treatment are to prevent relapses, reduce the frequency of relapses, and delay the progression of disability.  The most common treatments for MS are medications that reduce the immune response, such as corticosteroids and interferons.  Other treatments include monoclonal antibodies, such as natalizumab (Tysabri), which is designed to block the migration of immune cells into the CNS.  Other treatments may help to modify the course of the disease by changing the immune system, nerve growth factors, and neurotransmitters.  Researchers are actively investigating ways to repair the damage caused by MS, including cell transplantation, tissue grafting, and nerve and tissue growth stimulators.  Other strategies under investigation include anti-inflammatory drugs, vaccines, and drugs that downregulate the immune system.  Many experimental and clinical trials for MS are underway around the world.  For example, researchers are investigating a possible cure for MS by transplanting immune system cells that have been changed in the laboratory.  These cells are engineered to attack and destroy only the MS-causing antibodies and T cells.  This procedure is still experimental, however, and is being studied in clinical trials.  The search for a cure for MS continues, but the most effective treatment currently available is rehabilitation.  People with MS can benefit from working with physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists.  In addition, people with MS often need help in dealing with the emotional and mental stresses associated with the disease.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Although the exact cause of MS is not known, the disease is currently thought to result from a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. MS is usually diagnosed in young adults, with the peak onset at 30 years of age. The clinical course is highly variable, with periods of stability interrupted by recurrent acute attacks. MS is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by the following hallmark signs and symptoms: 1) lesions of the CNS that exhibit a well-defined inflammatory process with selective destruction of myelin; 2) areas of partial demyelination (i.e., some myelin present); and 3) variable degrees of neurologic disability. The clinical course of MS is highly variable. The onset is typically in young adults, with a peak onset at 30 years of age. The clinical course is often interrupted by recurrent acute attacks. In general, the clinical course of MS is marked by unpredictable acute attacks followed by variable degrees of recovery and clinical stabilization. However, the clinical course is highly variable, and several subtypes have been described. The clinical course is often divided into four subtypes: relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive, and progressive relapsing. The relapsing-remitting subtype is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks with variable recovery, but with periods of stability between attacks. The secondary progressive subtype begins with a relapsing-remitting course but eventually evolves to a steadily declining neurologic functional level during periods of remission, although superimposed relapses and remissions may still occur. The primary progressive subtype is characterized by a steady neurologic decline from disease onset, with no periods of remission. The progressive relapsing subtype begins with a progressive course that is punctuated by acute attacks.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system. The disease causes a wide range of symptoms, and can affect quality of life and life expectancy. Current treatment options are generally effective at managing symptoms, but do not cure the disease. However, a number of experimental treatments are currently being investigated, and some show promise. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) states that ""there is currently no cure for MS, but breakthroughs in research have led to a pipeline of new treatments."" The society predicts that ""within the next 10 to 15 years, we will have treatments that change the course of the disease.""  The NMSS lists a number of experimental treatments that are currently being investigated. These include: 1. Monoclonal antibodies - antibodies that attack the cells of the immune system that are thought to cause MS 2. Adult stem cells - cells that can differentiate into different types of cells, which are thought to have the potential to repair damage caused by MS 3. Immune modulators - drugs that suppress the immune system, which is thought to cause MS symptoms 4. Mitoxantrone - a chemotherapy drug that is thought to reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the body 5. Ocrelizumab - a drug that targets a specific type of B-cell, which is thought to contribute to MS 6. Oligoclonal bands - antibodies that are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of people with MS 7. Oral medications - medications that can be taken by mouth, which are thought to reduce inflammation in the central nervous system 8. Pulsed, high-dose methylprednisolone - a type of steroid that is thought to reduce inflammation and damage in the central nervous system 9.

There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, often shortened to SLE, is a chronic disease that is difficult to diagnose and treat. Another type, acute cutaneous lupus, usually involves only the skin and is not chronic. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. Finally, drug-induced lupus is caused by medications, most commonly hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, and quinidine. These medications can cause lupus-like symptoms, but disappear when the medication is stopped. Lupus is caused by a problem with the immune system.  Normally, the immune system protects the body from foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. In an autoimmune disease like lupus, the immune system attacks the body's own cells and tissues. In people with lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances and the body's own cells and tissues. As a result, the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own cells and tissues.

"1. Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood. It results from an abnormal growth of white blood cells. 2. Some people with leukemia can survive for many years, even decades, with no symptoms and no treatment. Others may experience complications and require treatment. 3. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells that do not function properly. These abnormal cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, which are needed to fight infections and regulate bleeding. As a result, people with leukemia are at risk for infections and excessive bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the bone marrow to other organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. 4. No, leukemia is not inherited.

###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.","1. What triggers the development of leukemia cancer?

The exact cause of leukemia is not known. However, there are risk factors that increase the chances of getting leukemia. These include:

- Genetics: Having a family member with leukemia increases your risk of getting the disease.
- Age: The risk of most types of leukemia, especially AML, increases as you get older.
- Gender: Men are more likely to get ALL and AML than women. Women are more likely to get CLL than men.
- Smoking: Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of developing AML.
- Exposure to chemicals: Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene, can increase the risk of getting leukemia.
- Previous Cancer Treatment: Certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers are linked to a higher risk of getting AML.
- Down Syndrome: Children with Down syndrome have a higher risk of getting leukemia.

Answer: 2. Can leukemia be overcome?

Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your body makes billions of them every day. In people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These abnormal cells crowd out the healthy blood cells. This makes it hard for the blood to carry out its normal functions.

There are different types of leukemia. They are usually grouped into two types:

Acute leukemia: These leukemias are the most common types. They include acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Chronic leukemia: These leukemias are the less common types. They include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

Treatment for leukemia depends on the type and how advanced it is. People with chronic leukemia usually start treatment when they have symptoms. People with acute leukemia need urgent treatment.

Treat","1. There are several types of leukemia, which are caused by damage to the DNA in the bone marrow. This causes blood cells to grow out of control and crowd out healthy blood cells. 2. Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, which are produced in the bone marrow. It is not a contagious disease, and it is not usually passed from one person to another. 3. Cells from the bone marrow travel throughout the body and are involved in many important functions, including fighting infections and regulating bleeding. When leukemia affects these cells, it can interfere with their ability to perform these functions. 4. Leukemia is not an inherited condition. It is caused by DNA changes that are acquired during a person's lifetime. 5. Advanced leukemia is leukemia that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, spleen, or brain. 6. Many patients are diagnosed with leukemia at an advanced stage, but with treatment, some patients can be cured. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the type and extent of the leukemia. 7. Yes, there are tests to detect leukemia before a person has symptoms. People at high risk for developing certain types of leukemia may have periodic blood tests to check for leukemia cells. 8. The most common treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. 9. The symptoms of leukemia depend on the type and extent of the disease. Some people have no symptoms at all in the early stages of the disease. Others may have symptoms that are related to the affected organs and include anemia (low red blood cell count), easy bruising or bleeding, fever, bone pain, and swollen lymph nodes. 10. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are different types of leukemia that affect different age groups and have different symptoms and treatments.

###SUPPORTING INFORMATION:","1. Researchers don't yet fully understand what leads to the development of leukemia. However, they do know that leukemia occurs when a group of white blood cells mutate and begin to multiply uncontrollably. The mutation may occur during the person's lifetime, or it may have happened earlier, when the person was a developing fetus. 2. Some people recover from leukemia. Survival rates depend on the type and extent of the leukemia, as well as the age and general health of the person. 3. The most common symptoms of leukemia are fatigue, weakness, and frequent infections. Swollen lymph nodes, spleen, and liver are also common symptoms. Bleeding andbruising are possible, as are unexplained weight loss and fever. 4. Leukemia is not passed down through genes. 5.

The first thing to consider is whether the hair loss is in fact reversible, or whether it is a sign of an underlying disease. 2. Alopecia areata is an example of temporary hair loss. This condition usually presents as one or more circular smooth patches of hair loss, most commonly on the scalp. 3. The cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune, and the body's immune system attacks the hair follicles. The course of the disease is unpredictable - the hair will regrow randomly, and the cycle of regrowth and loss will continue. 4. Treatment with steroids is the first line of attack.

"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. It is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. The disease is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. These include difficulty standing up, walking, and crawling. Those with the disorder typically are unable to walk by age 12 and are confined to a wheelchair by age 20. The life expectancy of males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the late teens or early twenties. It affects about 1 in 3300 newborn males.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that results in progressive muscle damage. It is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and include delayed development of motor skills, difficulty walking, and a waddling gait. Muscle weakness spreads to the legs, pelvis, and upper body, and eventually affects the muscles that help breathing and swallowing. Most people with the disorder use a wheelchair by age 12. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin, which is located primarily in muscles. Researchers think that dystrophin helps keep muscle cells intact. A lack of dystrophin leads to muscle damage and eventual loss of muscle tissue. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The disease is more common in boys than in girls.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited genetic disorder that involves progressive muscle weakness. It is the most common and most serious type of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy.  The disorder occurs almost exclusively in males. Females can carry the disease gene but usually do not show symptoms.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The condition is typically diagnosed before age 5, when parents may notice that the child has difficulty keeping up with peers in sports and other physical activities.  Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually appear before age 6. Diagnosis is based on a muscle biopsy and genetic testing.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore only one copy of the gene for dystrophin. If that copy is altered, the person has the disorder. The disorder is not passed on to sons by their carrier mothers, but all daughters will inherit the condition.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder caused by an inherited defect in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while females have two. If a male inherits an abnormal copy of the X chromosome, he will be affected. Females who inherit one abnormal copy of the X chromosome usually do not have symptoms of muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy usually appears in early childhood. The first signs of the disease are often clumsiness and inability to keep up with peers' developmental milestones. The disease can affect many parts of the body, but especially the muscles of the legs, pelvis, and upper body. The most severe form of the disease can result in an inability to walk, breathe, or eat, and can result in death by the age of 20. The disease can be detected at birth by a blood test, and by the age of 6 months by a muscle biopsy. Diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing. No cure or effective treatment exists, but supportive treatment can improve quality of life.","Yes, absolutely. You can get this information from a genetic counselor or a physician who specializes in genetics, or you can also contact the genetic and rare disease information center (GARD) of the National Institutes of Health.

Alternative options for treating your herniated disc include: physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic, yoga, and meditation. 2. In addition to these alternative treatments, you may also want to explore the following: water therapy, Pilates, and various other forms of exercise. 3. Make sure that you consult with your doctor before trying any alternative treatments, to ensure that they are safe for you to use.","1. You should be aware that the majority of herniated disc patients do not need surgery. Conservative treatment is recommended for at least 6 weeks before considering surgery.  2. Physical therapy is the most common non-surgical treatment for a herniated disc. Physical therapists will use a combination of treatments to help reduce your pain.  3. Medications can help reduce the amount of pain you feel. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be very helpful in reducing the amount of pain you feel. 4. If you are experiencing leg pain, you may be prescribed a nerve-specific medication.  5. Epidural steroid injections may also be used to help reduce pain. 6. If the pain is severe, your doctor may prescribe a short course of oral steroids.  7. Some people with a herniated disc find relief with alternative treatments such as chiropractic therapy, acupuncture, or yoga. 8.

Injections of steroids and anesthetics into the epidural space (epidural steroid injections) may relieve pain for a few months. 6. Surgery should be considered when a herniated disk causes: 1. Severe pain that does not respond to treatment. 2. Weakness or numbness in the legs. 3. Bladder or bowel dysfunction. 4. Increasing leg pain or numbness over time.","1. Non-surgical treatments are often the first line of treatment for a herniated disc. These treatments can include rest, physical therapy, medications for pain, and injections into the back (such as epidural injections). 2. If you have significant ongoing pain after a full course of non-surgical treatment, and your doctor believes that surgery would likely help you, surgery is a reasonable option. 3. Surgery can involve removing part of the disc, which is called a discectomy. The surgeon can remove all or part of the disc that is causing the problem. 4. Another type of surgery that is sometimes used is called a laminectomy. This involves removing the parts of the bone called the lamina that are causing pressure on the nerves. 5. If the surgeon removes all or most of the disc, it is called a discectomy. If the surgeon also removes the lamina, it is called a laminectomy. 6. If you have a lot of back pain but do not have any weakness in your legs, and the pain does not go down to your legs (called radicular pain), your doctor may recommend just a ""simple"" discectomy.

"10-year survival rate for prostate cancer is 85%. For breast cancer it is 80%. For colon cancer it is 65%. For lung cancer it is 15%. These are just examples to illustrate the point that the survival rate depends on the type of cancer. It also depends on the stage of cancer at the time of detection. If detected early, the survival rate is high. If detected late, the survival rate is low.","5-year survival for people with localized cancer is 83%, and for those with metastatic cancer is 17%. Relapse can occur after treatment is completed, but the risk depends on the type of cancer and how it was treated. It is hard to know what a person's life expectancy is without knowing much more about their case.","Yes, cancer can return even after all treatments are finished. It is called ""recurrence"" when it comes back in the same area where it first started. It can also come back in other parts of the body. The time frame can vary widely. Some patients live for many years after the cancer returns. Others may live for only a few months. Factors that affect the time frame include:  - The type of cancer  - How much time has passed since the end of treatment  - Where the cancer has returned  - Whether it has spread (including to the lymph nodes)    The doctor will talk with you about the prognosis for your situation. Prognosis is a way of saying how likely it is that the cancer will be cured or controlled. It is not the same as a prediction of how long someone will live.","1. It depends on type of cancer and treatment.2. Survival rates for people with cancer depend on many factors. These include the type and stage of cancer, the length of time between diagnosis and treatment, the extent to which the cancer has spread, whether the cancer is inherited, and the patient's age and general health.3. Survival rates are usually only given for people with cancer who are treated. If the cancer has not been treated, there is no way to know how long a person will survive.4. Survival rates are usually based on the outcomes of people in large groups. They are not necessarily accurate for an individual patient.","1. The chance of recurrence depends on many factors, including the stage of the cancer, the type of cancer, and the type of treatment. 2. People with cancer have a higher risk of developing a second cancer. The risk depends on the type of cancer and the treatment. 3. Most second cancers are more common in people who have had radiation therapy. 4. Survival rates depend on many factors, including the type and stage of the cancer, the type of treatment, the tolerance of the treatment by the patient, and the overall health of the patient. 5. Survival rates are usually based on the survival of people in studies who received the recommended treatments for their type of cancer. The survival rate for people with cancer will be lower if they do not receive the recommended treatments.","1. Survival rates for people with cancer depend on many factors. Only a doctor familiar with a person's medical history, type and stage of cancer, and treatment options can put all of this information together with survival rates to arrive at a prognosis. 2. Two numbers are used to measure survival rates. The 5-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. The 10-year survival rate is the percentage of people who live at least 10 years after their cancer is diagnosed. 3. Although survival rates can give a general idea of a person's prognosis, they do not take into account the many different ways that cancer can affect a person and the way that it will affect an individual person. 4. Survival rates are updated often as new treatments are developed and studied. Survival rates are different for each type and stage of cancer. 5. Some types of cancer have a better prognosis, meaning that they are more likely to be curable. Other types of cancer have a poorer prognosis, meaning that they are less likely to be curable. Prognosis also depends on a person's general health and ability to tolerate treatments. 6. Cancer treatments may cause other health problems. For example, chemotherapy can lead to heart damage, and radiation therapy can lead to bladder or kidney damage. These and other side effects should be considered when deciding on a treatment plan. 7. Some AIDS-related lymphomas have a poorer prognosis than other types of lymphomas, even when they are diagnosed at the same stage. 8. Many factors affect prognosis, including the type and stage of the cancer, the extent to which it has spread, and the patient's general health and age. 9. Prognosis is not always the same for every patient with the same type and stage of cancer. 10. Doctors use survival rates to try to determine a prognosis for a patient. A patient's prognosis depends on many factors, including the type and stage of cancer, the extent to which it has spread, and the patient's age and general health. 11.

A low viral load means that the immune system is working well, and the risk of developing AIDS or other complications is much lower. 4. There are many different types of ART. These include:    a. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).    b. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs).    c. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).    d. Protease inhibitors.    e. Integrase inhibitors. 5. The type(s) of ART that you should start taking will depend on:    a. How far the HIV infection has progressed (your stage of infection).    b. What other health problems you have.    c. How experienced you are with taking medicines.    d. What medicines you have taken in the past, including ART. 6. Your doctor will decide which ART is best for you based on these factors. 7. If you have been taking ART and your viral load is not suppressed, your doctor may change your ART regimen (change your medicines). 8. If you have been taking ART and your viral load is suppressed, your doctor may keep you on the same ART regimen. 9. The goal of treatment is to keep the virus suppressed. If you stop taking ART or take it irregularly, the virus will increase, and you will have a greater chance of developing AID","1. HIV/AIDS is a serious disease that weakens the immune system. Without treatment, people with HIV/AIDS have a reduced quality of life and a shortened lifespan. 2. HIV/AIDS treatment aims to stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of developing AIDS. 3. The first phase of HIV/AIDS treatment is antiretroviral therapy (ART). This therapy involves taking a combination of medications that stop the virus from replicating and infecting new cells. 4. If left untreated, HIV will eventually cause so much damage to the immune system that the body can no longer fight off opportunistic infections. These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other types of microorganisms. 5. People with HIV/AIDS may also experience neurological symptoms, such as dementia, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy. 6. Research has shown that early HIV treatment can help people avoid opportunistic infections and slow the progression of HIV/AIDS. 7. In addition to antiretroviral therapy, people with HIV/AIDS may also need additional medication to manage symptoms or prevent infections. 8. The best way to manage HIV/AIDS is to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.","1. HIV/AIDS treatment aims to control the virus and reduce its impact on the immune system. 2. The goal of treatment is to lower the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) to a level that is so low that the virus cannot be detected by a standard test. 3. The current standard of care for HIV is to use a combination of at least three drugs, often referred to as anti-retroviral therapy (ART). 4. The most commonly used drugs are called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which block the reverse transcriptase enzyme from converting the viral RNA into a DNA copy. 5. The HIV genetic material can mutate to become resistant to the antiretroviral drugs, so it is important to take the medications as prescribed and not to skip doses. 6. Missing doses, or not taking medications at the same time each day, can lead to the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV. 7. Resistance to one drug often means that the virus will become resistant to other drugs in the same class. 8. Therefore, it is important to discuss any missed doses with a healthcare provider and to never change or stop treatment without medical supervision. 9. The most common side effects of HIV medications are fatigue, nausea, and headaches, but these symptoms often decrease over time. 10. Other side effects include changes in body shape, diarrhea, and dry mouth. 11. Some of the NRTIs can cause mitochondrial toxicity, which can lead to lactic acidosis, peripheral neuropathy, and lipodystrophy. 12. The NRTIs also can cause anemia and neutropenia, which can increase the risk of infections. 13. The protease inhibitors can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 14. They also can cause hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. 15. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) can cause rash and can lead to hepatot"

"Sepsis is a condition that is caused when the body's response to an infection injures the body's own tissues and organs. This can happen when the body's immune system is too weak to fight off an infection, or when the infectious agent is too strong for the immune system to control.  Preventing sepsis is difficult because so many different types of people are at risk. To prevent sepsis, you should try to avoid getting infected. This means that if you are at risk for sepsis, you should seek medical care promptly for any infection. You should also make sure that you are up-to-date on your vaccinations. Certain vaccines can protect against bacteria that can cause sepsis.  People who are at risk for sepsis may also take antibiotics (called prophylactic antibiotics) before they have surgery or other medical procedures.

"1. Introduction & Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic gastrointestinal disorder with a high socioeconomic impact. Previous studies have suggested an association between IBS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the nature of this association remains unclear, and the relationship between the two conditions has not been investigated in a large, population-based sample. 2. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between IBS and PTSD in a large, population-based sample and to determine the strength of the association between the two conditions. 3. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed using data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey. Subjects were asked if they had been diagnosed with IBS by a doctor or other health professional. Subjects were also asked if they had ever been diagnosed with PTSD by a doctor or other health professional. Subjects with a history of IBS or PTSD were asked to report the age at which they were first diagnosed with each condition. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the strength of the association between IBS and PTSD. 4. Results: The study population included 29,461 subjects. Of those, 820 (2.8%) reported a history of IBS and 1,254 (4.2%) reported a history of PTSD. The mean age at diagnosis of IBS was 36.7 years, and the mean age at diagnosis of PTSD was 30.4 years. A history of IBS was associated with a history of PTSD (OR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.64-2.33). This association was strongest among female subjects (OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.94-2.89) and among subjects 45 to 64 years of age (OR 3.49; 95% CI, 2.54-4.69). 5. Conclusions:IBS and PTSD are associated in a large, population-based sample. This association is strongest among female subjects and among subjects","1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and alterations in bowel habits. 2. Although IBS is a benign condition, it is associated with significant socioeconomic costs, as well as significant psychological distress. 3. Recent data suggest that IBS patients have high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as other anxiety disorders, compared with the general population. 4. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between PTSD and IBS.","1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with no known structural abnormality. 2. The pathophysiology of IBS is not well understood, but it is believed that a combination of psychosocial factors and altered gut physiology may be responsible. 3. Stress has been identified as a key factor in IBS symptom exacerbation. 4. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that occurs after a traumatic event and is characterized by re-experience of the event, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. 5. PTSD and IBS share similar psychosocial risk factors and comorbidity. 6. Few studies have investigated the relationship between PTSD and IBS. 7. One study found that 40% of IBS patients met the criteria for PTSD, compared with 20% of the general population. 8. Another study found that 69% of IBS patients with severe symptoms had a lifetime history of PTSD. 9. A third study found that 42% of IBS patients reported a history of PTSD, compared with 12% of the general population. 10. A fourth study found that IBS patients with severe symptoms were more likely to have a history of PTSD than IBS patients with mild symptoms. 11. There is some evidence to suggest that PTSD is associated with an increased risk of IBS.","1. Introduction. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects up to 15% of the population. 2. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted to identify all studies that have investigated the relationship between IBS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies that examined the relationship between IBS and PTSD in human subjects; (2) studies that were published in English; (3) studies that included a clinical sample; (4) studies that reported at least one prevalence estimate; (5) studies that reported odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); (6) studies that were full-text articles or that included a full-text abstract; and (7) studies that were published after 1980. 3. Results.Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of PTSD among IBS patients ranged from 17% to 56%, with higher estimates found in tertiary care samples. Estimates of the co-occurrence of PTSD and IBS in the general population ranged from 11% to 28%, with higher estimates found in military samples. Several studies have also investigated the relationship between IBS and PTSD using physician-diagnosed samples. The prevalence of PTSD among IBS patients in these samples ranged from 27% to 55%. 4. Discussion. PTSD is significantly associated with IBS, particularly in tertiary care samples. Estimates of the co-occurrence of PTSD and IBS in the general population vary widely. More research is needed to clarify the relationship between PTSD and IBS in community samples.","1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown etiology, affecting millions of people worldwide. 2. PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after a person is exposed to one or more events that are outside his or her normal experience. 3. The symptoms of PTSD can develop after a range of traumatic events, including sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions and other threats on a person's life. 4. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events; mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues; attempts to avoid trauma-related cues; alterations in how a person thinks and feels; and changes in how a person behaves. 5. A person with PTSD is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm. 6. The diagnosis is made by a health care professional with the patient's self-reported symptoms being the most reliable indicator. 7. Treatment is typically by a combination of pharmacological and psychological methods. 8. No specific treatment is known, but medications are often used to help with specific symptoms. Psychological treatments are aimed at relieving symptoms through a variety of means, but benzodiazepines and beta blockers can also be used. 9. Some people may develop PTSD-like symptoms within three months of a traumatic event but this is not necessarily so. This group is sometimes said to have ""acute stress disorder"". 10. The disorder may last for many years and, in some cases, is a chronic condition.","1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder, and its pathophysiology is still not fully understood. 2. The co-occurrence of IBS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been investigated sufficiently to date. 3. The aim of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of IBS and PTSD in a group of patients with PTSD and compare them with a control group of patients with IBS and no PTSD. 4. The study included 120 patients with PTSD and 120 patients with IBS. Patients with PTSD were divided into two groups: those with and those without co-occurring IBS. Patients with PTSD and IBS were compared to the group with IBS only. 5. Patients with PTSD and IBS did not differ from patients with IBS only in terms of demographic data and clinical symptoms. However, patients with PTSD and IBS were characterized by higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization, as well as greater severity of symptoms and impairment of functioning. 6. The results of the study suggest that IBS should be considered as a potential biological marker of PTSD. Further research is needed to investigate the biological mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of these disorders.

Treatment is aimed at controlling or improving the symptoms associated with the condition. 2. In addition to regular eye exams, treatment for optic nerve atrophy may include: 3. Eyeglasses, contact lenses, or other visual aids to correct vision problems caused by the disease. 4. Low vision aids, such as special magnifying glasses or large print books, to make reading and writing easier. 5. Increased lighting or special training to help make the most of remaining vision. 6. Referral to community agencies and support groups for the visually impaired.","1. Optic atrophy is a sign that can be seen on an MRI scan of the brain. It means that the optic nerves (the two nerves that connect the eye to the brain) are not working properly. This can occur due to many different causes, including problems with the brain, the optic nerves, or the optic tracts (the areas of the brain that the optic nerves connect to). 2. There is no known treatment that will reverse optic atrophy. 3. However, it is possible to treat the underlying condition that is causing the optic atrophy. For example, if the optic atrophy is due to multiple sclerosis, then medications can be used to treat multiple sclerosis. 4. In addition, it is possible to treat some of the symptoms that may be associated with optic atrophy. For example, if vision loss has occurred, then there are various aids that can help a person who has vision loss perform everyday activities.","1. The treatment of optic neuropathy depends on the cause. 2. If the cause is thought to be due to an inflammatory process (such as sarcoidosis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis), high-dose steroids may be helpful. 3. If the cause is thought to be due to lack of blood flow (ischemia), the use of blood thinners such as aspirin may be helpful. 4. If the cause is thought to be due to pressure (such as from a tumor), decompression procedures may be needed. 5. If the cause is unknown, a procedure called a lumbar puncture may help. 6. In some cases, no specific cause can be found. 7. The treatment of optic neuropathy also depends on the location of the problem. 8.

"1. Insulinomas are a rare form of pancreatic cancer. 2. They are usually benign (non-cancerous) and do not spread to other parts of the body. 3. The average age at the time of diagnosis is between 40 and 50 years. Men and women have an equal chance of developing an insulinoma. 4. Insulinomas are often described as ""brittle tumors"" because they tend to be very sensitive to small doses of radiation. 5. Insulinomas are most often diagnosed when patients present with symptoms such as low blood sugar, dizziness, and sweating. 6. The symptoms are caused by the release of insulin from the tumor. 7. Insulinomas are usually diagnosed by measuring insulin levels in the blood. 8. Insulinomas are often treated by surgically removing the tumor.","1.

People with this condition may lose weight even though they eat a lot. 4. Insulinomas are usually not cancer and do not spread outside the pancreas. 5. Treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor.","1. The first step in the diagnosis of insulinoma is to perform a fast up to 72 hours. 2. During the fast, blood is drawn every 4-8 hours to check for serum glucose and insulin levels. 3. If the blood insulin levels are high relative to the serum glucose levels, an insulinoma is suspected. 4. The next step is to perform a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen to try to localize the tumor. 5. If this is unsuccessful, an endoscopic ultrasound is performed, followed by a selective arteriography with calcium stimulation. 6. This is followed by surgical removal of the tumor and pathological examination to confirm that it is an insulinoma. 7. If the insulinoma is not localized by these means, then a blind distal pancreatectomy may be performed. 8. The prognosis of insulinoma is excellent, with a 90% 5-year survival rate.","1.

"1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland does not make enough hormones after severe bleeding following childbirth. 2. The pituitary gland is a pea-sized organ behind the brain. It makes hormones that tell other glands what to do. 3. The pituitary gland controls the release of other hormones from the thyroid, adrenal and ovaries. It also controls milk production in women. 4. Sheehan's syndrome can lead to infertility and problems with breast and nipple development. It can also lead to low blood pressure, low body temperature, and low blood sugar. 5. People with Sheehan's syndrome may need hormone replacement therapy. Hormones may be given by mouth or through injections. 6. The doctor may also recommend vitamin D and calcium supplements.","1. Sheehan syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged during childbirth, leading to hormone deficiencies.2. In some cases, the pituitary gland is completely destroyed, and the patient will require lifelong hormone supplements.3. However, in other cases, the damage is partial, and the patient may experience hormone deficiencies many years after the birth.4. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, as well as hormone levels.5. The diagnosis may be missed if the patient does not seek medical attention until adulthood, when the symptoms may be attributed to other conditions.6. For example, a woman may attribute her lack of menstrual periods to menopause, rather than to a hormone deficiency.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged or destroyed during childbirth. It can cause problems with breastfeeding, slow growth rates in children, and low blood pressure. 2. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that tell the body when to grow and when to release milk. During childbirth, the pituitary gland can be damaged or destroyed. This is most often caused by severe bleeding (hemorrhage) after delivery. 3. The symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome include problems with breastfeeding, slow growth rates in children, and low blood pressure. It can also cause problems with fertility. 4. A doctor may diagnose Sheehan's syndrome based on symptoms. They may also do hormone tests and imaging tests, such as an MRI, to confirm the diagnosis. 5. Treatment for Sheehan's syndrome is based on the symptoms a person has. For example, if a person has low blood pressure, treatment may include using salt and water to raise the blood pressure. If a person has problems with milk production, treatment may include drugs that stimulate the release of breast milk.","1. Sheehan's syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough hormones. This can happen after severe bleeding during or after childbirth. 2.

The classic triad of symptoms consists of hypopituitarism, amenorrhea, and lactation failure. 5. Initially, patients may present with signs of hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. 6. Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing hormone levels and stimulation tests. 7. Treatment is supportive. 8. Prognosis is generally favorable.","1. Sheehan's Syndrome is a condition that occurs following severe postpartum hemorrhage and associated hypotension. It is characterized by pituitary gland dysfunction and failure of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.2. The pituitary gland is responsible for production of various hormones that regulate the function of other organs in the body. In Sheehan's Syndrome, the pituitary gland fails to produce adequate levels of these hormones, which can result in a variety of symptoms.3. Symptoms of Sheehan's Syndrome vary greatly among affected individuals. Some of the more common symptoms are failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, hypoglycemia, inability to regulate body temperature, and inability to withstand infections.4. Other symptoms include poor sexual development, lack of pubic hair, and abnormal menstrual cycles.5. In many cases, the symptoms of Sheehan's Syndrome are mistaken for other conditions, which causes a delay in diagnosis."
"10 out of 14 is a lot of people with frozen shoulder.  Frozen shoulder is a condition that is poorly understood.  It is thought to be related to inflammation of the capsule that surrounds the shoulder joint.  This inflammation causes the capsule to become thickened and tight.  This makes it difficult to move the shoulder.  Frozen shoulder is more common in people with diabetes.  It is also more common in people who have had a stroke.  Frozen shoulder is treated by range of motion exercises.  Sometimes, steroid injections are given to reduce inflammation.  In some cases, surgery is necessary to loosen the shoulder joint.

Inguinal hernias occur when the abdominal contents protrude through the abdominal wall in the groin area. The abdominal contents are normally held in place by muscles and other tissues. Weakness in these tissues can cause a hernia. 3. Many hernias can be treated without surgery. Some are mild and may not even need medical attention. They can be ignored and allowed to heal on their own. 4. Other hernias can be controlled with lifestyle changes, such as avoiding heavy lifting or vigorous exercise. 5. Surgery is usually recommended for hernias that are painful or persistent. 6. The surgical procedure for hernias is called herniorrhaphy. It is a common surgery, and most people have a mild recovery. 7. The surgery may be done through open surgery or with a laparoscope, which is a small camera inserted through a tiny cut in the skin. Recovery from laparoscopic surgery is faster and usually less painful than recovery from open surgery. 8. Older patients may have more health problems than younger ones, and may be less able to tolerate surgery. The risks of surgery are higher in older patients. 9.

The body will use its stored fat as a source of energy during physical activity. Increasing your physical activity causes the body to use more calories. This will create a negative energy balance and cause the body to use its stored fat as a source of energy.3) Do strength training. Strength training will not cause a significant loss of body fat, but it will increase your muscle mass which can increase your metabolism. Increasing your muscle mass can help you burn more calories.4) Eat a healthy diet. Eating a healthy diet is an effective way to lose fat. A healthy diet will provide the body with the nutrients it needs to function efficiently and effectively. A healthy diet will also provide the body with the nutrients it needs to build and maintain muscle mass. Eating a healthy diet will also help you to increase your metabolism.5) Get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep is an effective way to lose fat. Not getting enough sleep can cause the body to produce more ghrelin which can cause you to feel hungry and eat more calories. Not getting enough sleep can also decrease the production of leptin which can increase your appetite and cause you to eat more calories. Getting enough sleep will also help you to increase your metabolism.",1. LIPOSUCTION. Liposuction is a cosmetic surgery procedure that removes unwanted fat from the body.

The number one thing to cut back on is sugary drinks. Water is the best choice for hydration.","1) Individuals are responsible for their own health and well-being, including the choice to maintain a healthy weight. However, the food industry and government policies also play a role in the rise of obesity because they create an environment that makes it easy for individuals to make unhealthy choices. 2) A junk food tax would likely be an effective way to reduce obesity rates because it would increase the cost of unhealthy foods and encourage individuals to make healthier choices. 3) Preventing obesity requires promoting healthy eating habits and physical activity at a young age, providing easy access to healthy foods and safe places to exercise, and creating environments that encourage physical activity. 4) The advantages of engaging in 30 minutes of daily exercise and a healthy diet include improved physical fitness, weight maintenance, improved cardiovascular health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. 5) The government should play a significant role in combating","1) Lack of physical activity and poor eating habits are the primary causes of obesity. 2) No, I don't think that imposing a tax on unhealthy foods will lead to a decrease in obesity cases. I think that education about what foods are healthy and how to prepare them is more important. 3) Prevention of obesity can be done by educating people about what foods are healthy and how to prepare them. It can also be done by encouraging exercise and limiting television time. 4) Exercise and a balanced diet can help people to maintain a healthy weight, improve their mood, improve their self-esteem, improve their sleep, improve their heart health, improve their bone health, improve their digestion, and improve their overall appearance. 5) Yes, I think that the government should take a more active role in addressing the obesity epidemic. The government could do this by providing more funding for research and education about obesity.

However, the food industry, which produces and markets these foods, also bears responsibility for the problem. 2) Taxing junk food is unlikely to have a significant impact on obesity rates. The primary intervention needed to reduce obesity rates is to encourage healthy dietary and physical activity patterns. 3) Prevention of obesity should begin in early childhood, with the implementation of nutrition and physical activity programs in schools, as well as education about healthy food choices and physical activity. Parents can promote healthy habits by modeling healthy eating behaviors and encouraging physical activity. 4) Engaging in regular exercise and a balanced diet provide numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease,"
"1. Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that causes an increased risk of developing cancer. People with this condition have a higher risk of developing colon cancer, and rectal cancer. Women also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. 2. Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 (DNA repair genes). 3. In most cases, Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, the condition occurs due to a new mutation in one of the affected genes, and in these cases, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 4. Individuals with Lynch syndrome should have a colonoscopy every year, beginning at age 20 (or 10 years before the youngest age at which colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the family). A colonoscopy is an exam used to look inside the colon for signs of cancer. 5. Women with Lynch syndrome should have an endometrial biopsy every year, beginning at age 30 (or 10 years before the youngest age at which endometrial cancer was diagnosed in the family). An endometrial biopsy is a test to take a small sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to look for cancer cells. Women with a family history of Lynch syndrome may consider having a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries) to reduce the risk of developing endometrial and ovarian cancer.","1) Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that increases your risk of cancer. People with this condition have a higher risk of developing colon, rectum, stomach, liver, gallbladder, upper intestines, brain, and prostate cancer. Women also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer). 2) Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation (change) in one of several genes. It is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In rare cases, Lynch syndrome can be caused by a mutation in a gene called MLH1. This gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 3) Lynch syndrome is also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). It is usually diagnosed in people who have a family member with the condition. 4) To diagnose Lynch syndrome, you will need a genetic test. Blood tests can check for the gene mutations that cause Lynch syndrome. The test can be done on a person who has the condition or on someone who has no symptoms but wants to know if he or she has the gene mutation. 5) There is no cure for Lynch syndrome. However, regular screening tests can help find cancer early when it is easier to treat. Screening tests may include colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and imaging tests.","Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene. These genes normally help cells check for mistakes in the DNA code. When these genes are mutated, DNA replication and repair is not done properly, which can lead to cancer. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin and prostate. Lynch syndrome is most often diagnosed in people younger than age 50.","1. What is lynch syndrome? Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that increases the risk of developing colon cancer, as well as cancers of the rectum (endometrium), stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin and prostate. Lynch syndrome is also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). 2. Who is at risk for lynch syndrome? Lynch syndrome is most common in people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. It is less common in people of Swedish, Dutch, French Canadian, and British descent. 3. How is lynch syndrome diagnosed? To diagnose Lynch syndrome, a person must have at least 3 relatives (on either the maternal or paternal side) who have been diagnosed with an HNPCC-associated cancer. At least 1 of the 3 relatives must be a first-degree relative (parent, brother, sister, or child). 4. How is lynch syndrome treated? There is no known cure for Lynch syndrome. However, regular screening can help find colon cancer at an early stage when treatment can be more effective. People with Lynch syndrome should have a colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years, beginning at age 25 years. 5. Is there any way to reduce the risk of developing colon cancer if you have lynch syndrome? Yes. If colon cancer is found early, before it has spread outside the colon, the 5-year survival rate is 90%. Regular screening can help find colon cancer at an early stage when treatment can be more effective. People with Lynch syndrome should have a colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years, beginning at age 25 years.","1. The information about Lynch syndrome can be obtained from the American College of Surgeons by calling 1-800-200-3182 or by visiting the ACS website at www.facs.org. 2.

Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (cancer of the uterus) and ovarian cancer. 2. Who is at risk for Lynch syndrome?  Lynch syndrome occurs in both men and women, but women have a higher chance of developing colon cancer than men with Lynch syndrome. The condition is most common in Caucasians (white people), but it can occur in people of any race. Lynch syndrome is usually not present at birth. It is most often diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 years. 3. What causes Lynch syndrome?  Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation (change) in one of two genes, MLH1 or MSH2. These genes normally make proteins that are involved in repairing errors that occur during the replication (copying) of DNA. The mutation in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene leads to a lack of the protein, which results in DNA replication errors not being repaired. These unrepaired errors can cause abnormal cells to develop, which can lead to cancer. 4. How is Lynch syndrome diagnosed?  To diagnose Lynch syndrome, a person's family and medical history will be examined. A genetic test can be done to look for mutations in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene. It is usually done on a blood sample. 5. What are the treatments for Lynch syndrome?  There is no cure for Lynch syndrome. Treatment may involve keeping track of a person's colon and rectal health by doing regular colonoscopies (a colonoscope is a thin, lighted, tube-like instrument used to examine the inside of the colon and rectum). If colon or rectal cancer is found, it will be treated. Surgery to remove the affected part of the colon"
"Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the eye pressure increases. This increased pressure may be due to:  - Increased fluid production  - Decreased fluid drainage  - Fluid is unable to drain from the eye  The increased pressure may cause damage to the optic nerve. It usually happens slowly, so you may not notice changes in your vision until the glaucoma has caused significant damage.  The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower eye pressure. Medicines, laser surgery, and glaucoma surgery can all help protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  NIH: National Eye Institute","Yes, glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  How does glaucoma damage the optic nerve?  Increased pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is the main cause of optic nerve damage in glaucoma. This increased pressure usually occurs in the back of the eye. The fluid in the eye flows through a clear channel to the angle where the iris and cornea meet.  There, the fluid leaves the eye, and more fluid flows in. When the fluid reaches a damaged angle, it cannot flow out as easily. The excess fluid builds up, putting pressure on the optic nerve. This pressure can cause the nerve fibers to die, and eventually destroy the optic nerve.  How is glaucoma diagnosed?  Early glaucoma has no symptoms. That's why glaucoma is called ""the silent thief of sight."" As the disease progresses, you may notice a slight loss of peripheral vision.  Your eye care professional will diagnose glaucoma with a comprehensive eye exam that measures the pressure in your eye and tests how well your optic nerve is functioning.  What are the treatments for glaucoma?  To protect your eyes against vision loss, it's important to treat glaucoma before your optic nerve is damaged.  The most common treatment for glaucoma is prescription eyedrops. Sometimes, eyedrops are not enough to control the pressure in the eye. Your eye doctor may prescribe laser surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye. If you have glaucoma, your eye doctor will prescribe eyedrops, oral medications, or surgery to protect your eyes against vision loss.","1. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. 2. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 3. There are many types of glaucoma. The two main types are open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. 4. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. In the United States, it accounts for 90% of cases. 5. In open-angle glaucoma, the fluid leaves the anterior chamber of the eye through a space between the iris and the cornea. 6. In closed-angle glaucoma, also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, the fluid does not flow through that space. 7. With any type of glaucoma, the fluid leaves the anterior chamber through a space between the iris and the cornea. 8. The increased pressure in the eye from the fluid buildup causes damage to the optic nerve. 9. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain. 10. If the damage continues, it can lead to serious problems with your vision. 11. Some people, including African Americans over the age of 40, are at higher risk for glaucoma. 12. The condition tends to run in families. 13. Usually, there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. 14. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, the tunnel will get narrower and narrower. 15. This will result in blindness. 16. If caught early, glaucoma can usually be controlled. 17. Treatments can include prescription eyedrops, glaucoma surgery, or a combination of both.","Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness.

Treatment for glaucoma is usually with prescription eyedrops. Sometimes surgery is needed. The goal of treatment is to protect against vision loss. Early treatment is very important. To protect yourself against glaucoma, you should get regular eye exams. You should also tell your doctor about any medicines or eye drops you are using.

A clear fluid called aqueous humor flows through a space in the center of the eye. This fluid nourishes the cornea and lens. 3. The clear fluid leaves the eye through a special drainage system. 4. When the fluid leaves the eye, it passes through a special drainage system. The fluid leaves the eye through a special drainage system. If the fluid does not drain properly, the pressure inside the eye may increase. This is called intraocular pressure or IOP. 5. The higher the IOP, the greater the risk of optic nerve damage and vision loss. 6. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly. There are often no symptoms until the optic nerve has been damaged and vision loss occurs. 7. With closed-angle glaucoma, there are symptoms. You may have headaches, eye pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity to light. 8. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower the IOP. Your eye doctor will prescribe medicines, laser surgery, or conventional surgery to lower IOP.  9. There is no cure, but with early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.",1. The Glaucoma Research Foundation provides information about glaucoma and its treatment.

The underlying cause of the problem would need to be determined. This could be due to a disease like multiple sclerosis, or due to medications like statins.","1) Creatinine is a waste product of muscle contraction. It is released into the bloodstream and is filtered by the kidneys. 2) Creatinine clearance is a measure of how well your kidneys are working. It is calculated using a formula that takes into account the amount of creatinine in your blood and the amount of creatinine that passes through your kidneys into your urine. 3) Normal creatinine clearance for males is 95 to 115 milliliters per minute. 4) A creatinine clearance that is lower than normal may mean that your kidneys are not working as well as they once did. 5) This could be due to conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems. 6) Your doctor may order blood and urine tests to help diagnose the problem.",21.6 mg/dl is not high value. It is slightly above normal. Creatinine is a waste product of muscle. It is produced constantly by our body. Normal level of creatinine in blood is 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dl.

Surgery is the most common treatment for a symptomatic syrinx. Syringomyelia is treated by surgical decompression of the foramen magnum. 2. Surgical treatment of scoliosis is an important part of the overall management of patients with spina bifida. 3. Intrauterine surgery is a new approach to repairing spina bifida before birth. 4. Neurotoxin therapy is another new approach to treating spina bifida. 5. The surgical treatment of a syrinx involves relieving the blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow.,"1. Spina bifida: Treatment of spina bifida includes surgical closure of the neural placode within 24 hours after birth to minimize irreversible neurological damage. 2. Vertebral fusion: Vertebral fusion is treated by a multidisciplinary team, including orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and rehabilitation specialists. Surgical treatment of scoliosis and other deformities is often necessary. 3. Syrinx: Treatment of syrinx includes the use of a hyperosmotic agent such as mannitol to draw fluid out of the area of injury and into the ventricular system of the brain where it can be absorbed. Injecting a sclerosing agent such as Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) into the syrinx may also be helpful.","1. Spina Bifida: a. In the absence of a neural tube defect, spina bifida occulta usually requires no treatment. b. When the defect is large enough to allow protrusion of the spinal cord or spinal nerves, surgical closure of the defect is indicated. The objective is to prevent damage to the cord or nerves by exposure to the environment. c. Surgical closure is performed as soon after birth as possible; the earlier the defect is closed, the better the prognosis. Spina bifida is treated by neurosurgical closure of the defect and postoperative antibiotic therapy. d. Postoperative shunting of CSF may be required to relieve hydrocephalus. 2. Vertebral fusion: a. A fixed, progressive deformity of the spine is an indication for surgery. b. Surgery is usually performed after skeletal maturity. Fusion of the spine in a deformed position can lead to a second deformity, which is often more severe than the first. c. Surgery should be directed at correcting both the primary and secondary deformities. 3. Syringomyelia: a. Surgical treatment of syringomyelia is indicated when a definite neurologic deficit can be attributed to the syrinx. b. The most common surgical approach is a posterior decompression with or without a duraplasty. The rationale for posterior decompression is that a syrinx develops in the area of cerebellar or dorsal brainstem tissue within the spinal cord and, therefore, should be approached posteriorly. c. Other surgical approaches have included anterior surgery, and in some cases, a combined anterior and posterior approach has been used.",1) Surgical approach: The surgical treatment of the syrinx is the most commonly used treatment. It involves the placement of a shunt to drain the fluid from the syrinx into the peritoneal cavity. This shunt may be placed from either the ventricles (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or directly into the syrinx (syringoperitoneal shunt). 2) Endoscopic third ventriculostomy: This procedure is performed to drain the fluid from the syrinx by creating a new opening in the floor of the third ventricle (foramina of Luschka). 3) Chiari decompression: This procedure is performed to release the pressure on the cervical spinal cord by removing the posterior arch of the atlas. 4) Vertebral column resection: This procedure is performed to correct the deformity of the vertebral column. 5) Ultrasound destruction of syrinx: This procedure is performed to destroy the syrinx by using focused ultrasound energy. 6) Intrathecal antibiotic treatment: This procedure is performed to inject antibiotics directly into the CSF to treat infections.,"1.

"1. You are suffering from Gilbert's syn PMC-LLaMA.  2. There is a mutation in the promoter region of the gene that encodes UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme, which leads to decreased enzyme expression. This enzyme conjugates bilirubin. 3. Because of decreased enzyme activity, unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in blood and is excreted into bile. 4. Increased biliary excretion of unconjugated bilirubin leads to increased concentration of bilirubin in bile. This unconjugated bilirubin refluxes back into the blood circulation causing jaundice. 5. Increased concentration of bilirubin in bile can cause stones by precipitating with calcium. 6.

"1) The first thing to do is to get a complete workup to make sure that she does not have any evidence of metastatic disease. This would include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If there is no evidence of metastatic disease, then treatment options include: 2) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy is a type of therapy given before surgery. It is given with the intention of shrinking the tumor in order to make it easier to remove surgically. It also helps to reduce the size of the tumor to make breast conservation surgery an option. 3) After surgery, she will need to undergo radiation therapy to the breast. This is done to reduce the risk of local recurrence. 4) She will also need hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen) or chemotherapy depending on the pathology report of the surgical specimen.","1. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is usually recommended after lumpectomy for tumors that are in a high risk of recurrence, such as tumors that are large, have spread to the lymph nodes, or are a type of cancer called invasive lobular cancer. 2. Hormone therapy. Hormone therapy is used for tumors that are sensitive to hormones. These are called estrogen-receptor positive tumors. 3. Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is used for tumors that are HER2-positive, which means they have an abnormal gene called HER2. The drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used to treat these tumors.","1) The first step is to have the mass biopsied and tested for estrogen and progesterone receptors. 2) If the tumor is hormone-receptor positive, then the recommended treatment is a hormone therapy (tamoxifen). 3) If the tumor is hormone-receptor negative, then the recommended treatment is chemotherapy. 4) After the surgery, if the tumor is found to be estrogen- or progesterone-receptor positive, then hormone therapy may be continued. 5) If the tumor is found to be negative for estrogen or progesterone receptors, then hormone therapy is not an option.","1.

Meesman's dystrophy is a bilateral, autosomal-dominant, progressive corneal dystrophy. It usually presents in the first or second decade of life but can present as early as the neonatal period. 2. It is characterized by the appearance of round cysts in the corneal epithelium, which initially appear as white opacities but eventually fill with fluid and become more elevated. 3. The condition slowly progresses, with the cysts increasing in size and number. 4. The cornea becomes edematous and hazy, and the vision deteriorates. 5. The cysts eventually break down, and the cornea becomes scarred, resulting in marked reduction of vision, sometimes to less than 20/200. 6. In advanced cases, penetrating keratoplasty may be required. 7. Recent work suggests that the pathogenesis of Meesman's dystrophy may be related to mutations in the TCF8 gene, which encodes for Zinc Finger E-box Binding Protein 1 (ZEB1). 8.

14 women were followed for a mean of 5.3 years after the completion of primary treatment.,"5-year survival rates in ovarian cancer are 40 to 50 percent when the cancer has been detected early, before it has spread outside the ovary. The 5-year survival rate is 90 percent if the cancer has not spread outside the ovary and 30 to 40 percent if the cancer has spread to other organs.","Yes, additional research and studies have been conducted on women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. A report of the results of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Ovarian Project (NSABP) Protocol P1, a randomized study of the effectiveness of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal women with ovarian cancer, appeared in the November 2000 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. In addition, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a new ovarian cancer clinical trials cooperative group in 1999. This group, called the GOG-109, will direct studies on the treatment of early and advanced ovarian cancer.","177 new studies have been added to the ovarian cancer section of the website, including studies on causes, risk factors, prevention, and screening. Studies on diagnosis, treatment, and management have also been added.","2006 was a pivotal year in the history of ovarian cancer research. That year, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network published a landmark paper that would forever change the way scientists and physicians viewed ovarian cancer. The paper, entitled Detection of somatic copy number alterations in the cancer genome project, described the first whole-genome characterization of a major human cancer. The researchers used DNA microarrays to analyze the entire genome of 11,000 tumors from 11 different types of cancer, including 400 ovarian cancers. They discovered that ovarian cancers have the highest genetic diversity of any cancer type, with each tumor harboring an average of 600 mutations. The researchers also found that the mutations accumulated gradually over time, allowing the cells to evade the immune system by reducing the expression of tumor antigens. In addition, they found that the mutations clustered in only a few genomic ""hotspots,"" suggesting that only a handful of genes are mutated repeatedly in ovarian cancers. This discovery could help scientists develop new drugs that target specific mutations in these genes.

Since the publication of this paper, researchers have worked tirelessly to uncover the molecular underpinnings of ovarian cancer. Scientists at the University of Washington, for example, discovered that a protein called ID4 regulates the activity of cancer-causing genes called p53 and k-ras. They also found that ID4 is frequently downregulated in ovarian cancers, leading to the overactivation of these genes and the development of cancer.

Answer: Yes",1) The NCI-sponsored Ovarian Cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) have conducted studies to collect tissue and blood samples from women with ovarian cancer. 2) The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Ovarian Project (NSABP) has conducted studies to collect tissue and blood samples from women with ovarian cancer. 3) The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has sponsored a study to collect tissue and blood samples from women with ovarian cancer. 4) The NCI-sponsored Prostate Cancer and Ovarian Cancer Data (Predictors) Resource (PDX) has collected and is characterizing tissue and blood samples from women with ovarian cancer. 5) The NCI-sponsored Ovarian Cancer Tissue Bank has collected and is characterizing tissue samples from women with ovarian cancer.

Riluzole (100 mg twice daily) was approved for ALS because it provides a modest survival benefit (by about 2-3 months). Riluzole probably exerts its beneficial effects by interfering with the processes of programmed cell death. Side effects are few and include fatigue and gastrointestinal upset; it is also hepatotoxic. 2. Symptomatic Therapy. Symptoms in ALS are treated as they arise. The two most common symptoms, pain and depression, are managed with pharmacologic agents. Pain is usually treated with standard analgesics, but the management of neuropathic pain may require agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or amitriptyline. Depression may respond to any of a number of antidepressant medications. 3. Nutrition. The American Academy of Neurology has concluded that enteral nutrition (that is, feeding tubes) should not be used routinely in patients with ALS, but rather should be considered on a case-by-case basis. In patients who are aspirating, if a trial of non-oral feeding is successful, a gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy tube should be placed. 4. Glucocorticoids. In a large, controlled, prospective study, glucocorticoids were shown to improve the overall survival of patients with ALS. Treatment was most effective when therapy was started early. The authors of this study recommend that patients with ALS be treated with 10 mg of prednisone per day or 40 mg of azathioprine per day. These agents are to be used with the intention of slowing progression, not with the hope of reversing weakness. 5. Other Agents. A number of other agents have been tested in ALS without clear evidence of efficacy. These include vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, oxcarbazepine, and calcium channel blockers.","1. Riluzole: Riluzole is the only medication that has been shown to modestly prolong survival in patients with ALS. The usual dose is 50 mg twice a day. Riluzole has been shown to modestly prolong survival in patients with ALS. The usual dose is 50 mg twice a day. 2. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): A large randomized, placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate any benefit of NSAIDs in the treatment of ALS. 3. Creatine and Coenzyme Q10: These are supplements that have been widely used by ALS patients based on anecdotal reports of efficacy. However, a large randomized trial failed to demonstrate any benefit in ALS patients taking creatine and Coenzyme Q10. 4. Cigarette smoking: Cigarette smoking has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of ALS. However, there is no evidence that cigarette smoking is protective once a patient has developed ALS. 5. High-dose steroids: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate any benefit in ALS patients treated with high-dose steroids. 6. Other medications: Medications that have been tried in ALS without any evidence of efficacy include: thyroid hormone, growth hormone, vitamin E, vitamin C, copper, zinc, anti-oxidants, and pentoxifylline. 7. Foods: There is no evidence that any specific food is protective in ALS.","1. Riluzole: Riluzole is the only medication that has been shown to prolong life in patients with ALS. It has been shown to increase survival by 2-3 months. It is also useful for the relief of pain. Riluzole is well tolerated in most patients; common side effects include fatigue and weight loss. 2. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV): The use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) can improve ventilation and decrease the frequency of respiratory infections in patients with ALS. It is recommended for use in patients with ALS who develop respiratory insufficiency. 3. Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation should be considered early in the course of ALS, even if the patient is ambulatory. Rehabilitation can include the use of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation equipment. The goal of rehabilitation is to prevent contractures and improve the patient's quality of life.","1) Coenzyme Q10 and creatine may be used as supplements, but there is no strong evidence that they slow the progression of ALS. 2) Clinical trials using growth hormone and glucocorticoids have failed to show any benefit in slowing the progression of ALS. 3) A recent study showed that patients with ALS who took high doses of vitamin C experienced a slightly slower progression of the disease. 4) Avoidance of gluten in the diet is being studied as a possible treatment for ALS.","1. Riluzole (100 mg daily) is the only medication that has been shown to modestly prolong life in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2. Although not approved for ALS, gabapentin (100-300 mg three times daily) may help with the ""spastic"" component of the disease. 3. Celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) has been shown in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to prolong life in patients with ALS. 4. The drug ""riluzole"" has been approved by the FDA for ALS. 5. High-dose vitamin C may slow the progression of ALS. 6. A high-calorie diet may slow the progression of ALS."

"1. Pregabalin is not addictive. It does not produce a ""high"" or ""kick"" and does not cause dependence. 2. The most common side effects of pregabalin are dizziness, sleepiness, tiredness, weight gain and swelling of the feet or hands. These side effects may go away after taking pregabalin for a few weeks. 3. Withdrawal symptoms have not been reported with pregabalin.","Pregabalin is a controlled substance (C-V) and is used to treat neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and nerve pain associated with diabetes. It is similar to gabapentin (Neurontin). Pregabalin works by slowing the signals along nerve cells. It affects the way your brain and nervous system respond to pain, thereby reducing the pain. It is not clear how pregabalin works in the brain and how fast its effects begin. Pregabalin is taken by mouth. It is usually started at 75 milligrams (mg) once daily with an increase up to 150 mg/day in divided doses, usually with the largest dose taken at bedtime. The dose may be increased up to 300 mg/day in divided doses. The dose for children under 12 years old is not known. Pregabalin is usually taken with food. It may be taken less often at first to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Your doctor may gradually increase the dose to 150 to 300 mg/day. It may take 2 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of pregabalin. Continue to take pregabalin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pregabalin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking pregabalin, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, or seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over at least one week. Pregabalin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food twice a day with the largest dose taken at bedtime. It may be taken less often at first and then increased to twice a day as your body adjusts to the medication. The capsules are supplied in the following strengths: 50 mg - blue, 75 mg - white, 100 mg - yellow, 150 mg - orange, 200 mg - white, 300 mg - blue. The 50 mg, 75 mg, and 10","1. Pregabalin is a relatively new drug and long-term studies are lacking. 2. Pregabalin is often prescribed for other conditions such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and generalized anxiety disorder. These conditions may require long-term treatment and the question of how to taper the medication is relevant. 3. Pregabalin has a half-life of approximately 6 hours and is eliminated from the body relatively quickly. It is possible that the lack of information on withdrawal symptoms is due to the rapid elimination of the drug. 4. Pregabalin is not typically prescribed for addictive or psychiatric conditions. Withdrawal symptoms may be less severe for individuals who are not physically dependent on the medication.","1. Because the study assessed the symptoms people experience when they stop taking pregabalin after having taken it for at least six months. It is possible that the symptoms experienced during the first six months of treatment may differ from those experienced during discontinuation.

2. The study assessed only the symptoms experienced during the first eight weeks of discontinuation. It is possible that the symptoms experienced during the following weeks or months of discontinuation may differ from those experienced during the first eight weeks.

3. The study assessed only those symptoms that participants reported to the researchers. It is possible that participants experienced other symptoms that they did not report.

4. The study assessed only those symptoms that participants reported to the researchers that they attributed to withdrawal from pregabalin. It is possible that participants experienced symptoms that they attributed to other causes.","The safety and effectiveness of pregabalin in the treatment of neuropathic pain has been established in part on the basis of comparisons with placebo.

"Yes.  You may have heard of people who lose vision in only one eye due to macular degeneration.  This condition can cause dizziness or loss of balance because the brain is no longer getting a clear image from the eye that is affected.  The brain then begins to rely more heavily on the other eye for vision.  If the other eye is healthy, the loss of vision in the affected eye may not be noticed at first.  However, when the brain begins to receive a blurred or distorted image from the good eye, the person may experience dizziness, or have problems with depth perception or seeing at night.","1. No, it does not cause dizziness. 2. However, it does cause a loss of balance while walking. 3.

Macular degeneration rarely causes dizziness.",1. No. Having macular degeneration in just one eye does not cause dizziness. 2. Yes. Having macular degeneration in both eyes can cause dizziness.,"Yes, it can.  Macular degeneration is a disease of the retina.  The retina is the very thin tissue at the back of the eye that contains the light sensitive cells that allow you to see.  Macular degeneration is a disease that affects the macula, the very center of the retina.  The macula is responsible for fine vision, such as reading and driving.  Macular degeneration can cause problems with these activities.  Macular degeneration can cause dizziness because of the changes in the retina.  The symptoms of macular degeneration vary from person to person.  Some people with macular degeneration do not need extra lighting for reading or close work.  Others may find that they need extra lighting.  Some people with macular degeneration find that they can see better in bright light.  The changes in the macula cause problems with central vision.  If the changes are mild, vision may be fine for daily activities.  If the changes are severe, vision may be very poor.  Macular degeneration does not affect side (peripheral) vision.  This may be helpful because only central vision is lost.  People with macular degeneration can usually look around and see objects to the side without moving their heads.  This ability to look around is not possible with loss of peripheral vision."

The discoloration of the toe could be due to a circulatory problem that has resulted in decreased blood flow to the toe. 2. Poor circulation to the toe could be due to an injury to the artery that supplies blood to the toe. 3. Poor circulation could be due to an embolism in the artery that supplies blood to the toe. 4. Poor circulation could be due to atherosclerosis that has built up in the artery that supplies blood to the toe. 5. In addition, there are several different types of peripheral vascular disease that can cause discoloration of the toe. 6. Angiography would be helpful in determining the cause of the discoloration of the toe.","1. The color change in the toe that was exposed to the cold could be due to a number of causes. It is difficult to give an exact diagnosis without seeing the toe. 2. It could be due to a localized vasculitis or inflammation of the blood vessels.

There are no studies in the literature that confirm the genetic basis of periventricular heterotopia with idiopathic scoliosis.","1. The genetic basis of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is still largely unknown. 2. Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVH) is a rare malformation of the brain, and its etiology has also not been determined. 3. A few studies have investigated the genetic basis of IS and PVH in separate studies. 4. The genetic region between 19p13.2 and 19p13.1 has been identified as a potential locus for IS in a British family. 5. The authors of this study suggested that the genetic basis of IS may be heterogeneous. 6. Another study of a large French family with 12 individuals affected by IS identified a potential locus at 17q22, although the authors suggested that the genetic basis of IS may also be heterogeneous. 7. Other genetic loci have been identified as potential candidates for IS, but the findings have not always been replicated in other populations. 8. In a study of 11 families with PVH, a genetic locus was identified at 2q33-34. 9. The authors suggested that the genetic basis of PVH may also be heterogeneous. 10. However, no studies have investigated the genetic basis of IS and PVH together. 11. In this study, we have identified a potential common genetic locus for IS and PVH in a large British family. 12. This finding suggests that the genetic basis of these conditions may be more similar than previously thought and may be more akin to a monogenic than a heterogeneous complex multigenic etiology. 13. This finding could have implications for the genetic testing of these conditions. 14. This family also had a further 3 conditions -- biparietal foramina, optic nerve coloboma, and mild intellectual disability -- which may also have a shared genetic basis. 15. This study therefore highlights a potentially important genetic locus for a spectrum of neurological conditions, which may be due to a single genetic etiology."

"1. Nicotine is absorbed through the oral mucosa and buccal tissue, with a peak blood level achieved in 10-15 minutes. 2. The half-life of nicotine is about 1.5 hours in smokers. 3. Nicotine binds to specific receptors in the brain, including those that release dopamine. 4. Dopamine stimulates the brain's reward system, which is involved in addiction. 5. The physiological effects of nicotine include increased blood pressure and heart rate, increased gastrointestinal activity, and increased release of glucose into the bloodstream. 6. The stimulant effect of nicotine on the brain, coupled with the slowed reaction time, may explain why smokers have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. 7. Smoking also affects the digestive system. It increases the production of stomach acid and causes inflammation of the lining of the esophagus. 8. Smoking also increases the risk of developing diabetes, gallstones, and cataracts. 9. Smoking is a known risk factor for infertility and miscarriage. 10. Women who smoke have a greater risk of osteoporosis, and smoking increases the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.","20 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA (n = 10), UK (n = 4), Sweden (n = 3), Japan (n = 2), and Denmark (n = 1). The studies were conducted in a variety of settings including in vivo (n = 14), in vitro (n = 4), and in silico (n = 2). The study designs included randomized controlled trials (n = 5), nonrandomized controlled trials (n = 4), cohort studies (n = 2), case-control studies (n = 2), and case series (n = 5). The study population included smokers (n = 12), non-smokers (n = 6), and a mixed smoking population (n = 2). The age of the study population ranged from 19 to 55 years.

Nicotine affects digestion and absorption through multiple mechanisms. It increases gastric acid secretion, delays gastric emptying, and increases intestinal motility. These effects are mediated via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nicotine also increases intestinal absorption of non-nutrient or nutrient compounds, possibly via dopamine receptors. The effects of nicotine on digestion and absorption are dose-dependent. At low doses (< 10 mg), nicotine stimulates the central nervous system and causes an increase in appetite and thirst. At high doses (> 15 mg), the effects of nicotine on digestion and absorption predominate. The effects of nicotine on digestion and absorption are not mediated by nicotine addiction, as nicotine-naive individuals also exhibit these effects.","1. Smoking has a negative impact on digestion and nutrient absorption due to reduced gastric emptying time, increased intestinal motility, and decreased absorptive villi time. 2. Nicotine specifically affects the autonomic nervous system, causing increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity. This leads to increased hea rate, blood pressure, and gastrointestinal motility. 3. Smoking also increases the risk of gastrointestinal cancers, such as esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer. 4. Smoking cessation should be a priority in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, as smoking negatively affects the digestive system and increases the risk of gastrointestinal cancers.","1. Nicotine is absorbed from all parts of the digestive tract. 2. The rate of absorption from the stomach is slow, but it is fastest from the duodenum. 3. Nicotine is distributed rapidly to all parts of the body, and it is detectable in the plasma within 10 seconds after oral ingestion.","1) Smoking contributes to peptic ulcer disease by increasing gastric acid production and by decreasing mucosal blood flow. 2) Smoking increases intestinal motility and may cause diarrhea. 3) Smoking delays gastric emptying and may cause nausea and vomiting. 4) Smoking may increase appetite and impair satiety, which may contribute to overeating and obesity.","1. Smoking increases the risk of gastrointestinal cancers and digestive system diseases such as peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 2. Smoking may also increase the risk of gallstones and pancreatitis. 3. Smoking interferes with the digestion and absorption of food. Nicotine constricts the blood vessels that carry nutrients to the digestive system, which can reduce the amount of nutrients that are absorbed. Smoking also increases the secretion of stomach acid, which can cause irritation and damage to the lining of the digestive system over time. 4. Smoking can also increase the risk of certain gastrointestinal infections."
"1. Yes, you should continue to have regular Pap tests even after a complete hysterectomy. 2. This is because there is still a small risk of developing cancer in the vaginal cuff stump left behind after a hysterectomy. 3. The risk of developing vaginal cuff cancer is higher in women who have had a hysterectomy for: - a high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or - a vaginal, cervical or uterine cancer. 4. The risk of developing vaginal cuff cancer is lower in women who had a hysterectomy for: - a low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or - a benign condition like leiomyomas or endometriosis. 5. Women who had a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer need to have a vaginal cuff smear every year. 6.

The American Cancer Society recommends that women who have had a hysterectomy for: - a low-grade CIN or - a benign condition should have a vaginal cuff smear every 3 years until they have had 3 consecutive negative smears.","1. It is recommended that women who have had a total hysterectomy, including removal of the cervix, continue to have regular Pap tests (or cytologic screening) to detect any cancer that may have developed in the vaginal cuff. 2. For women who have had a total hysterectomy, including removal of the cervix, the recommended interval for Pap tests (or cytologic screening) is every 3 years until the age of 70 years, and then no more frequently than every 5 years. 3. For women who have had a hysterectomy that did not include removal of the cervix, the recommended interval for Pap tests (or cytologic screening) is every 3 years until the age of 70 years, and then no more frequently than every 5 years.","1) No, because you had a full hysterectomy, which included removal of the cervix, you do not need to continue getting pap smears. 2) However, if you are over 65 years of age and have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results within the past 10 years, then you may discontinue screening. 3) If you have a history of CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia), then you should continue to get screening even if you had a full hysterectomy.","1. Yes, for a person who has had a total hysterectomy, a Pap smear is still recommended every 3 years until the age of 65 years. 2. This is because the vaginal cuff is still at risk for developing high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and invasive cancer. 3. If the person had high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or invasive cancer at the time of hysterectomy, then Pap smear every 6 months till 65 years of age is recommended. 4. If the person had low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions at the time of hysterectomy, then Pap smear every 3 years till 65 years of age is recommended.","1. Yes. 2.

The American Cancer Society recommends that a woman have at least one Pap test every three years after a hysterectomy. 4. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that a woman who has had a hysterectomy should continue to have a Pap test every year. 5. The American Cancer Society and ACOG agree that women no longer need Pap tests if they have had a total hysterectomy, but they should still get a Pap test if they have had a partial hysterectomy.","1. Yes, even after a total hysterectomy, a woman should still be screened for cervical cancer at regular intervals unless she has had her uterus and cervix removed. 2. The current recommendation is that a woman should have a Pap smear every two years if she has had three negative annual smears in a row. 3. This means that a woman with three negative smears in a row has a very low risk of developing cervical cancer. 4. Therefore, after three negative smears in a row, the doctor may decide to do fewer frequent smears or even stop doing them altogether. 5. However, if a woman has had a total hysterectomy, she should still have an annual smear even if her cervix was removed. This is because there is a small risk of developing cancer of the vagina or the very top of the cervix, which can be detected by a Pap smear."

The symptoms of SCA3 usually begin in middle age. They include:  Trouble walking and uncoordinated movements (ataxia).  Muscle stiffness (dystonia).  Problems with eye movements.  Speech problems.  Slow movement and stiffness in the limbs.  Tremors.  Tight muscles (spasticity).  Other symptoms may include:  Difficulty swallowing.  Dementia.  Depression.  Muscle spasms.  Seizures.  Sleep disturbances.  Weakness.  Some people also have symptoms of the related disorder, Machado-Joseph Disease, such as:  Dysarthria.  Facial muscle weakness.  Gait disturbance.  Generalized muscle stiffness.  Oculomotor abnormalities.  Tongue fasciculations.  The cause of SCA3 is a mutation in the ATN1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-1. Researchers believe that this protein plays a role in regulating gene expression. Ataxin-1 is involved in many processes, including the development and function of the nervous system. Researchers think that problems with ataxin-1 cause SCA3.  Scientists have identified mutations in the ATN1 gene in people with SCA3. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and genetic testing. There is no cure for SCA3. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.

Try not to stress out. 5. Try to keep the sores clean and dry. 6. You can apply an ice pack to the sores to reduce pain and inflammation. 7. You can use an over-the-counter cream to ease the pain and discomfort. 8. You can take pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. 9. Avoid spicy or acidic foods that may irritate the sores. 10. If the sores become infected, you may need antibiotics.","Cold sores are caused by a virus and are very common. They usually go away on their own in 7 to 10 days. You can ease symptoms by applying ice or a warm cloth to the sore, and by avoiding hot, spicy foods. Medicines that can be applied to the sore include those containing phenol (such as the ones with ""dental"" in the name), those containing antiviral drugs (such as acyclovir), and those containing steroids. Antiviral creams may shorten the course of the cold sore if they are started early.","Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus. They may appear on the mouth, lips, or throat. Most people who have cold sores experience a tingling or burning sensation before the sores appear.  Cold sores typically last for 2 to 3 weeks. They may recur from time to time but usually decrease in frequency over time.  You can buy over-the-counter creams or ointments to ease the pain and discomfort of cold sores. Antibiotic creams can help prevent secondary bacterial infections.  To prevent spreading the virus to other areas of your body or to other people, avoid touching the sores. Keep the sores clean and covered with a bandage while they are active.","Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1. The first time you are infected with this virus, the condition is called primary herpes. You may have no signs or symptoms, or you may have a variety of symptoms, including a headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in your neck. It may take 2 weeks or longer for the sores to heal. After you are exposed to the virus, the condition is called recurrent herpes. Your symptoms may be mild, or you may have a severe outbreak, with many sores that are painful and slow to heal.  Cold sores typically start with a tingling or burning sensation, followed by the formation of a small, raised, and sometimes itchy bump or blister. This bump gradually becomes a painful ulcer about 1/2 to 1 inch in size. The cold sore is usually located on the lip, but it can appear anywhere on the mouth or on the skin around the mouth. The blister usually breaks open and forms a crusty scab. Cold sores typically heal without treatment in 7 to 10 days.  Over-the-counter medications can relieve the pain and discomfort of cold sores. These include ointments that numb the blister, antibacterial ointments that prevent infection, and ointments that soften the crust and help it fall off. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can relieve the pain of cold sores. You should not use aspirin if you have a cold sore because it can lead to a serious condition called Reye syndrome.  Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, can relieve symptoms and shorten the healing time if they are started early in the outbreak, usually within 24 hours of the appearance of the first blister. These medications are most effective when taken prescribed by your doctor.",1. Wash your hands thoroughly after touching cold sores.,"Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1.

"1. HIV is treated with a combination of antiretroviral medicines.2. There are five classes of ARV drugs: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), Protease inhibitors (PIs), and Integrase inhibitors (IIs).3. The choice of drugs is individualized based on the patient's viral load, CD4 count, and clinical stage of HIV disease, as well as the patient's age, pregnancy status, prior antiretroviral drug history, and medical comorbidities.4. HIV is treated with a combination of three or more ARV drugs.5. The most commonly used combinations include two NRTIs with either a PI or an NNRTI.6. The combination of two NRTIs with a PI is known as ""highly active antiretroviral therapy"" (HAA).7. The majority of HIV-infected individuals who are receiving HAA regimens will achieve a clinical and immunologic response within the first 6 months of treatment.8. The goals of HAA are to:a. Suppress HIV replication as evidenced by plasma HIV RNA levels less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ),b. Increase CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, andc. Reduce the risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies.9. A patient is considered to have a ""successful response"" to HAA if virologic suppression (plasma HIV RNA levels less than the LLOQ) is achieved and maintained for 2-3 years post-treatment.10. The most common side effects of NRTIs are a. Bone marrow suppression, manifested as anemia and neutropenia, and b. Lipodystrophy.11. The most common side effects of PIs are a. Lipodystrophy and metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and fat redistribution, and b. Gastrointestinal symptoms","1.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a worldwide pandemic. In the United States, approximately 1.2 million people are infected with HIV, and 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. 1 HIV preferentially infects cells of the immune system such as helper T lymphocytes, leading to the gradual depletion of this cell population and, thereby, compromising the immune response. The CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is the most important predictor of the risk for development of opportunistic infe"

As an Airport employee interacting with hundreds daily, when can I safely resume work without exposing others to Shingles?

Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in individuals who have had chickenpox in the past. It presents with a unilateral vesicular dermatomal eruption, which may be associated with severe pain. Shingles is contagious during the vesicular phase through direct contact or respiratory secretions. Patients are contagious until all lesions have crusted. The risk of transmission is greatest during the first 2 to 3 weeks after the rash appears. There is no specific treatment for shingles. Antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) may be used in immunocompromised patients or those over 60 years of age. Treatment of pain is with analgesics (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or opiates). Pain that does not respond to treatment with analgesics is treated with anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine). Shingles vaccine is recommended for individuals over 60 years of age. In healthy individuals, it reduces the incidence of shingles by 51% and the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia by 66%. Since the vaccine is only effective against the causative agent (VZV), it is not effective in the treatment of active shingles.",2-3 weeks after the rash has cleared up.,14 days after the onset of the rash.,"1.

Soy products contain a substance called ""goitrogens,"" which can interfere with thyroid hormone production.  Some studies suggest that eating large amounts of soy may increase the risk for thyroid cancer.  Soy products are not a major concern if consumed in moderate amounts, but you should avoid consuming large amounts.  You may want to consider limiting your intake of foods that are high in soy, such as tofu, soy milk, and other soy products.  You may want to consider taking an iodine supplement.  Iodine is an essential mineral that is needed for thyroid hormone production.  Most people get enough iodine from the foods that they eat, but some people may be deficient in iodine.  Nodular goiters may be caused by iodine deficiency.  Taking an iodine supplement may help your nodular goiter shrink.  Be sure to talk with your doctor before starting any kind of supplement.  You should also make sure that you are getting enough zinc and selenium in your diet.  Zinc and selenium are needed for normal thyroid hormone production.  You can increase your intake of these minerals by eating foods rich in zinc and selenium, such as shellfish, nuts, and whole grains. 2. Herbs:  Herbs are not a major treatment for nodular goiter.

"1) If your arrhythmia is causing symptoms or is detected with tests, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments: Medications. Your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or to reduce the risk of developing a potentially harmful arrhythmia. These medications may include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Electrical shock. In some cases, your doctor may recommend using an electrical shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. This procedure is called cardioversion. If your arrhythmia is caused by a reversible problem, such as an overdose of a medication or an electrolyte imbalance, cardioversion may be the only treatment you need. Surgery. If your arrhythmia is caused by a structural problem, such as scarring from a previous heart attack or a malformed heart valve, your doctor may recommend surgery to correct the problem. This may involve creating a pacemaker to trigger heartbeats, or replacing or repairing a malformed valve. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers. These devices can monitor your heart rhythm and deliver an electrical shock when you need it. If you have a history of arrhythmias or other heart problems, your doctor may recommend an ICD or a pacemaker to help prevent sudden cardiac death.","1. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a procedure used to treat certain types of arrhythmias. During the procedure, your doctor will use an electrode catheter to deliver energy to the area of your heart that causes the arrhythmia. The energy destroys the abnormal heart tissue and helps prevent the arrhythmia from occurring. Radiofrequency ablation is often the preferred treatment for people who don't respond to medications or for those who have recurrent or severe arrhythmias. 2. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a small, battery-powered device that constantly monitors your heart rate and rhythm. If a very fast, irregular heartbeat or a life-threatening arrhythmia occurs, the device delivers a jolt of electricity to restore your heartbeat to a normal rhythm. 3. Pacemaker is a small, battery-powered device that sends electrical signals to your heart to treat a slow heartbeat. If you have a heartbeat that is too slow, a pacemaker can help.","1. The latest therapy for heart arrhythmia is called catheter ablation. It is a nonsurgical treatment that uses heat to destroy the abnormal heart tissue causing the arrhythmia. 2. During the procedure, a doctor places a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into an artery in your groin or arm and threads it to your heart. 3. Radio waves or cold energy is used to destroy the abnormal heart tissue. 4. The procedure usually takes 2-4 hours, and you'll spend the night in the hospital for observation. 5. You'll recover from the procedure in about 2 weeks. 6. Catheter ablation is a good treatment option for people with heart arrhythmias who don't respond to medications or can't tolerate them.

Antiarrhythmic Medications: There are many types of medications that can be used to treat arrhythmias. Some of the more commonly used ones include: Quinidine, Procainamide, Disopyramide, Tocainide, Mexiletine, Propafenone, Flecainide, Encainide, Sotalol, Adenosine (Adenocard), Amiodarone, Dronedarone. 2. Ablation: Ablation is a procedure that uses energy (heat or cold) to remove or destroy tissue. The goal of ablation is to destroy the tiny area within the heart that is the source of the abnormal rhythm, but leave the rest of the heart undamaged. Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation are the two most common types of ablation used to treat heart rhythm disorders. 3. Pacemakers and Implanted Defibrillators: Pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are small devices that are implanted under the skin. They constantly monitor the heart rhythm and can deliver electrical energy to the heart if it detects a dangerous rhythm. Pacemakers are used to treat bradyarrhythmias. Implantable defibrillators are used to treat potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation. 4. Surgery: In rare cases, surgery may be used to treat arrhythmias. For example, if a person has a tumor in the heart that is causing an arrhythmia, the tumor can be surgically removed.","1) The latest developments in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias involve implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. 2) ICDs are used to treat patients who have life-threatening arrhythmias, and CRT devices combine ICD therapy with biventricular pacing for patients who also have a slow heart rate. 3) Newer generation devices provide more accurate detection of arrhythmias and better discrimination of potentially dangerous rhythms from benign ones, resulting in fewer shocks and better long-term survival. 4) Other new therapies include antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and devices to reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with potentially lethal arrhythmias."
"Dear Mehrnaz, Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but usually affects the skin, joints, blood vessels and organs. It can be mild or severe. The goals of treatment are to:  prevent flares  treat flares when they occur  reduce damage to joints and organs  reduce pain and other symptoms  help you live your life to the fullest.  There is no cure for lupus, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control it.  The treatment depends on severity, which is judged by how many organs are affected by lupus, and by blood tests.  People with mild disease may need only NSAIDs for pain and sometimes a short course of steroids. People with more severe disease need steroids, immunosuppressant medications, and sometimes other drugs.  The most commonly used medications for lupus are:  steroids such as prednisone,  Hydroxychloroquine,  Mycophenolate mofetil,  Azathioprine,  Methotrexate,  Cyclophosphamide,  IV immunoglobulin, and  Rituximab.","Lupus is a chronic disease that can affect any part of the body, but mostly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, and brain.  There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus, another type, causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns.   Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women than in Caucasian women. The cause of lupus is not known.  Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are joint pain or swelling, muscle pain, fatigue, and skin rashes. Other symptoms include fever, chest pain when taking a deep breath, and sensitivity to the sun. There are also many other symptoms.  Lupus is usually diagnosed by a blood test and, sometimes, a skin test. There is no one specific test for lupus. The diagnosis is made from many factors, including the symptoms, physical exam, and blood tests. There is no cure for lupus, but medications and other treatments can help control it.","1) For mild disease: NSAIDs, antimalarials and occasionally corticosteroids.2) For moderate disease: NSAIDs, antimalarials, corticosteroids and DMARDs.3) For severe disease: NSAIDs, antimalarials, corticosteroids, DMARDs and immunosuppressive drugs.","1) Medications: There are several different medications that can be used to treat lupus. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used to treat joint pain and fever. Steroids are used to treat more serious symptoms of lupus. Steroids can be taken by mouth in pill form or can be given intravenously in the hospital. Steroids can also be injected directly into joints or muscles to help treat localized symptoms. Antimalarial drugs are also used to treat lupus. These medications were originally developed to treat malaria but have been shown to be effective in treating lupus as well. 2) Lifestyle Changes: In addition to medications, there are several lifestyle changes that someone diagnosed with lupus can make to help manage their symptoms. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough rest and relaxation can all help manage symptoms of lupus. It is also important to avoid smoking and excessive drinking of alcohol.","Lupus has no known cure, but medications and lifestyle changes can help control symptoms. Current treatment focuses on:  Preventing flares  Treating flares when they occur  Reducing organ damage  Balancing the effects of medications with the risks of long-term therapy  Maintaining quality of life  The goals of lupus treatment are:  To prevent flares  To control symptoms  To reduce organ damage and other problems  To minimize disability  To maintain quality of life  To provide supportive therapy for the person with lupus  To educate patients about their disease  To provide supportive therapy for family members  To promote interaction and communication among patients, family members, and health care professionals  To encourage independence and self-help","1. Lupus is a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the immune system attacking the body's own tissues. The disease can be mild or severe. 2. Lupus is treated with medicines that suppress the immune system. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs, and corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medicines that are used to treat severe lupus. 3. Other drugs that may be used to treat lupus include: anticoagulants (blood thinners), cholesterol-lowering drugs, and medicines used to treat gout, high cholesterol, and heartburn. 4. People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You may need to see a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles), a nephrologist (a doctor who specializes in kidney problems), and a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems)."

Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or aspirin, can be very effective for many types of pain. 3. Prescription medications, such as opioids, can also be very effective for pain. However, because of their potential for abuse and dependence, they require a prescription from a doctor. 4. Topical creams or gels that contain pain-relieving medications can also be very effective for localized pain. 5.

The pain your loved one is experiencing due to the condition that has developed over time is called ""Chronic Pain"".  Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often requires a multidisciplinary approach.  This includes medications, physical therapy, psychological therapy, and alternative treatments.  It is important to identify the cause of the pain and treat it if possible.  Medications are often used to treat chronic pain.  Common medications include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants.  Physical therapy can help to reduce pain by increasing strength and flexibility.  Psychological therapy can help to reduce pain by helping to cope with the emotional aspects of chronic pain.  Alternative treatments such as acupuncture, massage, and chiropractic care may also be helpful.  2. As far as surgery is concerned, it is usually reserved for cases of chronic pain where other treatments have failed.  The surgery that you are referring to is an amputation.  Amputations are only done when other treatments have failed.  The success rate for amputations depends on the level of amputation (below the knee vs above the knee) and the cause of the pain.  Amputations are not always successful and the patient may still have pain.  Therefore, it is important to try other treatments before considering amputation.","1) Firstly, I would advise you to take your loved one to an Ayurveda doctor for an expert opinion.2) Ayurveda has a vast range of medicines that can help in the treatment of this condition.3) If surgery is inevitable, you can also opt for post-operative Ayurvedic treatment, which will help in faster recovery and lessen the chances of a relapse.4) In the meantime, you can also try some simple yoga and pranayama techniques, which will help in reducing the pain and stress associated with the condition.","1.

"1. There are no standard treatments for melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes.  The most common treatments include surgery to remove the lymph nodes and radiation therapy.  However, these treatments do not prolong survival.  Therefore, the use of new therapies to treat melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes is very important.  2. Radiation therapy is not likely to affect the treatment of melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes.  However, radiation therapy to the leg may affect the ability to use the leg during and after treatment.  This may affect the ability to participate in clinical trials and other treatments.","1. Radiation therapy may be used as the primary treatment for melanoma with local or regional spread, or it may be used in addition to surgery for patients considered at high risk of local or regional recurrence. 2. Radiation therapy may also be used for palliation of symptoms caused by local or regional disease. 3. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown to improve local control in patients with primary melanoma of the head and neck, extremities, and other anatomic sites. 4. Neither the AJCC staging system nor the most recent CSDT staging system includes information regarding the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases to guide the use of radiation therapy.","5-year overall survival for stage IV melanoma is 15-20%.

They may include: loss of muscle strength and coordination (ataxia) shuffling gait slurred speech difficulty swallowing and choking while eating difficulty with arm and leg movements scoliosis (curvature of the spine) numbness and tingling in the arms and legs gradual loss of vision, hearing, and speech progressive dementia 3. The most common cause of Friedreich ataxia is a mutation in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. This protein plays a role in mitochondrial function. 4. There is no cure for Friedreich ataxia. Treatment focuses on the symptoms. Physical therapy may help to maintain muscle strength and function. Surgery may be used to correct foot and leg deformities and scoliosis. Speech therapy may help with speech problems. 5. Friedreich ataxia cannot be prevented.

Friedreich ataxia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of muscle strength and coordination (ataxia), speech impairment, and heart problems. 2. It is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene which codes for the protein frataxin. 3. Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. 4. Research has identified a number of potential treatment strategies for Friedreich's ataxia, including those that promote frataxin-independent autophagy, and gene therapy approaches. 5. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health, is sponsoring several clinical trials on Friedreich's ataxia.",1.

Patients with Friedreich ataxia develop progressive weakness and loss of coordination (ataxia) of limbs, resulting in an inability to walk. 2. The heart is affected, causing loss of heart function (cardiomyopathy) and/or irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias). 3. The eyes may develop poor vision (vision loss) due to optic atrophy and/or cataracts. 4. The nerves to the arms and legs often become abnormally large (dysmyelinating polyneuropathy). 5. The disease usually begins in childhood or in young adulthood and is inherited. 6. Friedreich ataxia is caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene (FXN) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. 7. The frataxin gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. This protein is needed to make a molecule that is involved in iron metabolism. 8. Research suggests that frataxin helps regulate the amount of iron in cells. Iron is an important part of the chemical machinery of cells. 9. Researchers suggest that the loss of frataxin leads to a breakdown in the normal regulation of iron in cells, which can cause problems with the nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems. 10. The most common mutation involves the substitution of one base (adenine or guanine) for another base (cytosine or thymine). This type of genetic alteration is called a point mutation. 11. In most cases, people with Friedreich ataxia have an expanded GAA triplet repeat in the frataxin gene. This type of mutation is called a trinucleotide repeat expansion. 12. In people with Friedreich ataxia, the GAA triplet repeat occurs in a section of the frataxin gene that is involved in regulating the amount of iron in cells. 13. The most common trinucleotide repeat expansion involves a section of the frataxin gene that is repeated 100 to 900 times. People with Friedreich ataxia who have an expansion of 100 to"

"1. Yes, a pacemaker can prevent these spasms. 2. The pacemaker will detect when the heart rate slows down too much and will fire a pulse to correct it. 3. This prevents the heart from beating too slowly, which can trigger a spasm in the coronary arteries. 4. The pacemaker will also detect when the heart rate is too fast and will fire a pulse to slow it down. 5. Again, this will prevent the heart from beating too fast, which can also cause coronary artery spasms. 6. In summary, the pacemaker can prevent coronary artery spasms by preventing the heart rate from getting too slow or too fast.","1) Yes, it is possible to prevent these spasms with a pacemaker.2) The pacemaker will pace both the right atrium and right ventricle.3) In order to prevent the spasms, the pacemaker has to pace the right atrium first, and then the right ventricle.4) This will ensure that the contraction of the right atrium will come before the contraction of the right ventricle.5) Because the right atrium will contract before the right ventricle, it will increase the blood flow into the right ventricle, and hence increase the volume of the right ventricle.6) With an increased volume, the contraction of the right ventricle will be stronger, and hence the pressure generated by the right ventricle will be stronger.7) With a stronger pressure generated by the right ventricle, it will be able to open the semilunar valve completely, and hence prevent the spasms.",Pacemakers are used to treat a slow heart beat. They do not treat spasms. Medicines are used to treat spasms.,"1. No, pacemaker will not prevent these spasms from happening.2. The spasms you describe are likely due to premature atrial contractions (PACs).3. Premature atrial contractions are caused by a defect in the electrical system of the heart.4.

"1.  Penile curvature is a common problem in men. 2.  The curvature may be due to an anatomical defect, or it may be a result of damage to the penis from a trauma or infection. 3.  Most cases of penile curvature are not severe and can be managed with nonsurgical techniques. 4.  The goal of nonsurgical penile curvature management is to reduce the curvature to a point where sexual intercourse is comfortable and effective. 5.  There are several nonsurgical techniques for managing penile curvature. 6.  These include the use of penile prosthetics, vacuum devices, and penile traction devices. 7.  Penile prosthetics and vacuum devices are used to manage penile curvature due to a trauma or infection. 8.  Penile traction devices are used to manage penile curvature due to an anatomical defect. 9.  Penile prosthetics and vacuum devices are expensive and may not be covered by insurance. 10. Penile traction is less expensive and may be covered by insurance. 11.  Nonsurgical penile curvature management is not a permanent solution. 12.  Surgical management of penile curvature is usually reserved for cases in which nonsurgical techniques have failed. 13.  The goal of surgical penile curvature management is to straighten the penis to a point where sexual intercourse is comfortable and effective. 14.  There are several surgical techniques for managing penile curvature. 15.  These include the use of grafts or flaps to lengthen the penis, and placement of penile implants to straighten the penis. 16.  These procedures are expensive and have potential complications. 17.  The success rate of these procedures varies greatly. 18.  The decision to undergo surgical management of penile curvature should be made after a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks.","1. There is no need to straighten a penis that is curved due to birth defects. Curved penises have no effect on sexual function or fertility. 2.

Medications (such as Xiaflex) injected directly into the scar tissue of the penis. This treatment is only used for severe cases of Peyronie's disease. 5. Surgery to remove the scar tissue and reconstruct the penis. This treatment option is only used for severe cases of Peyronie's disease. 6. Alternative treatments for Peyronie's disease include: a. Placing a constant gentle pressure on the affected area of the penis to try to reduce the build-up of scar tissue. b. Vitamin E, which some people believe helps to reduce inflammation and promote healing in the penis. c. Herbal remedies such as pycnogenol, which is thought to help reduce inflammation and promote healing in the penis.","1.

If the penis is too curved to allow sexual intercourse, it may be possible to straighten it using a series of small operations. This is a good option if the penis is very curved and if the man is married or involved with a woman. 3. There are other options that involve surgery, but these tend to make the penis smaller and less functional. 4. There are also non-surgical procedures, such as injections that can make the penis look larger or straighter, but these do not work for curved penises.","1. The curved penis is a condition that is usually treated with surgery. 2. Surgery can be used to correct the penis curvature. 3. The most common surgery is called the Nesbitt operation. 4. During this operation, the surgeon makes two small cuts in the fibrous band of tissue that is causing the penis curvature. 5. The area is then stitched back together, and the penis is straighter. 6. The Nesbitt operation usually works well, but it may not work for everyone. 7. Some people may need more than one operation. 8. Other surgeries have also been used to treat penis curvature, including the use of skin grafts. 9. The choice of surgery depends on the cause and how severe the penis curvature is.","1) If you're not satisfied with the current options, you can always try to wait and see how things develop. 2) Curved penis caused by birth defects usually doesn't cause any problems with sexual intercourse, so if you're not experiencing any problems, you can wait and see how things develop. 3) If you're experiencing problems with sexual intercourse, you can always try to use lubricants to facilitate penetration. 4) If you're not satisfied with the current options, you can always consider surgical intervention.

In patients with hypercalcemia and high PTH levels, parathyroidectomy is indicated.","1. Yes, high levels of vitamin D can be due to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands, which can be due to a condition called primary hyperparathyroidism. 2. Primary hyperparathyroidism results from an adenoma (benign tumor) of the parathyroid glands, which causes excessive secretion of PTH. 3. PTH causes increased reabsorption of calcium and increased secretion of phosphorus and vitamin D in the kidneys. 4. Increased levels of vitamin D cause increased absorption of calcium from the intestines and increased resorption of bone, which can lead to bone pain and osteoporosis. 5. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a benign adenoma of the parathyroid glands, but other causes include genetic disorders, infection, and inflammation. 6. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made by measuring blood levels of PTH. Treatment is surgical removal of the affected parathyroid gland(s).","1. Yes, there is a possible link between high vitamin D levels and pituitary gland. 2. The pituitary gland is only found in humans and is located in the brain. It is sometimes called the master endocrine gland because it controls the release of so many hormones. 3. The pituitary gland is sometimes called ""the mother gland"" because it makes the TSH hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones. 4. High vitamin D levels can cause an increased secretion of TSH from the pituitary gland which can lead to hyperthyroidism. 5. Hyperthyroidism can cause the breakdown of bone tissue and this can lead to a higher level of calcium in the blood. 6. The parathyroid glands respond to the increased calcium levels by producing more parathyroid hormone (PTH). 7. The PTH causes the bones to release more calcium into the blood and this calcium is taken up by the kidneys. 8. The increased calcium in the blood causes the kidneys to produce more Vitamin D. 9. The increased Vitamin D in the blood causes the increased secretion of TSH from the pituitary gland which can lead to hyperthyroidism.","↑ Vitamin D levels are not related to pituitary gland. ↑ Vitamin D levels are related to increased exposure to sunlight, fat malabsorption, certain medications (like anticonvulsants), and increased age.",1.

Its website is: http://www.arthritis.org/.","1. What is ankle arthritis?  Arthritis is the inflammation or swelling of a joint. It happens when the protective cartilage on the ends of the bones wears down.  Ankle arthritis affects the joint where the shinbone and the foot bones meet.  Over time, the cartilage in this joint wears down. As a result, the bones rub together, and pain, stiffness, and swelling develop.  Ankle arthritis also causes shoening of the muscles around the joint. This makes it harder to walk and more likely to develop ankle injuries.  Ankle arthritis is common in people over 40 years old. It is more common in women than men. People with a family history of arthritis, or who have had an ankle injury, are more likely to develop ankle arthritis. 2. What are the symptoms?  Symptoms of ankle arthritis include pain and swelling around the joint. Some people also feel stiffness, especially when they get up after sitting or lying down.  As the condition gets worse, people may develop problems moving the ankle. The shoe or sock may rub uncomfortably on the affected area. 3. How is ankle arthritis diagnosed?  Your doctor will diagnose ankle arthritis by doing a physical examination and taking a medical history.  X-rays are often needed. Your doctor may also order blood tests to rule out other causes of joint pain. 4. What are the treatments for ankle arthritis?  Treatments for ankle arthritis include medicines, lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and surgery.  You may be able to manage mild ankle arthritis with lifestyle changes and medicines. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help relieve pain and swelling.  Your doctor may prescribe coicosteroids to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.  If the joint is very damaged, your doctor may recommend surgery. This may involve removing part of the joint and replacing it with artificial parts.",1) Physiotherapy for Ankle Arthritis: The following resources are available to help patients and their families better understand ankle arthritis and physiotherapy. 2) Arthritis of the Ankle: Learn about arthritis of the ankle from the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. 3) Ankle Exercises: Try these exercises to help relieve ankle pain and improve your balance and coordination. 4) Physical Therapy for the Foot and Ankle: Learn more about physical therapy for the foot and ankle from the American Physical Therapy Association.,"1. Ankle Arthritis: Arthritis of the ankle is most often the result of an injury or wear and tear. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis that affects the ankle. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease, is another common cause of ankle arthritis. 2. Physical Therapy for Ankle Arthritis: Physical therapy can help relieve pain, improve joint mobility, and strengthen the muscles around the ankle. A physical therapist will assess your condition and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may require only exercises and stretches to relieve pain and improve joint mobility. If you have more severe ankle arthritis, your physical therapist may recommend a combination of treatments, including exercises, stretches, and other treatments. 3. Exercises and Stretches for Ankle Arthritis: Your physical therapist may recommend a combination of exercises and stretches to help relieve your ankle pain and improve joint mobility.

There is no scientific evidence that suggests a possible link between the head and neck tics of Tourette's syndrome and the development of hydrocephalus.","1. The probability of having both conditions is very low. Hydrocephalus develops due to blockage of CSF circulation, and Tourette's syndrome does not cause hydrocephalus. 2. Tics associated with Tourette's syndrome are not likely to cause hydrocephalus. Tics are sudden, rapid, repetitive, involuntary movements or sounds that some people make due to an urge they cannot resist. Tics are not usually harmful, but in some cases, they may interfere with normal activities and speech."

"1. Is it hard to get an erection?  2. Do you have early ejaculation?  3. Are you sexually satisfied?  4. Do you have any other medical problems?  5. Do you take any medicines or drugs? If you answer ""yes"" to the first question and ""no"" to the others, you may have a condition called erectile dysfunction. This is the inability to get or keep an erection hard enough to have sex. It's a common problem, affecting up to 1 in 3 men.  If you answer ""no"" to the first question and ""yes"" to one or more of the others, you may have another type of problem called premature ejaculation. This is when a man reaches orgasm and ejaculates too quickly, often before his penis is even erect.  Premature ejaculation is common, particularly with a new partner. It also may occur only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation.  Both erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation may be related to psychological factors, such as worry and anxiety. For example, worry about poor performance may cause you to become so distracted that you cannot have an erection or stay erect.  Stress may also play a role. For example, stress may interfere with sexual function, and illness or medicines also may cause problems.  Certain medical conditions and lifestyle choices also may contribute to erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation. These include the following:  - Diabetes  - High blood pressure  - High cholesterol  - Heart disease  - Stroke  - Nerve damage (neuropathy) from diabetes, chronic alcoholism, or other causes  - Drug or alcohol addiction  - Tobacco smoking  - Obesity  - Age  - Lack of exercise  - Stress  - Long-term relationships  - Low testosterone levels  - Certain medicines  If you have persistent erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation, you should see your doctor. The problem should not be ignored because it may be a symptom of other serious disorders.  Your doctor will diagnose erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation from your medical history","1. Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity. 2. The most common cause of erectile dysfunction is insufficient blood flow to the penis. 3. Causes of insufficient blood flow include: 4. The most common pharmacologic treatments for erectile dysfunction are PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra). 5. PDE5 inhibitors work by blocking PDE5, an enzyme that destroys cGMP. 6. By blocking PDE5, cGMP can continue to excite the smooth muscle of the penis, allowing for an erection. 7. Other treatments for erectile dysfunction include: a. Alprostadil (Muse) - a PGE1 analogue b. Papaverine - a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor c. Phentolamine - an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent d. Testosterone replacement therapy for men with low serum testosterone levels.","1. Sildenafil (Viagra): It is a selective inhibitor of cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) specific PDE-5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) enzyme. It prevents degradation of cGMP causing enhanced relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle and prolonged penile erection. 2. Tadalafil (Cialis): It is also a PDE-5 inhibitor but has a longer half-life than sildenafil. 3. Vardenafil (Levitra): It is also a PDE-5 inhibitor but has a shorter half-life than sildenafil. 4. Alprostadil (Misoprost): It is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog. It acts by increasing blood flow in cavernosal smooth muscle. 5. Papaverine: It is a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It relaxes cavernosal smooth muscle, increasing blood flow and causing penile tumescence. 6. Phentolamine: It is an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. It relaxes cavernosal smooth muscle, increasing blood flow and causing penile tumescence. 7. PGE1: It acts by increasing blood flow in cavernosal smooth muscle. 8. PGE2: It also acts by increasing blood flow in cavernosal smooth muscle. 9. PGI2: It also acts by increasing blood flow in cavernosal smooth muscle. 10.

Lung cancer is a very challenging disease to treat, and the treatment options depend on the stage or extent of the disease.  For patients with lung cancer, the first step is to determine the stage or extent of the disease.  This is done by a combination of imaging studies including CT scans of the chest and upper abdomen and a PET (positron emission tomography) scan of the body.  Depending on the stage, the treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.  For patients with stage IV or advanced disease, which means the cancer has spread outside the chest, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.  There are a number of different chemotherapy regimens including doublet and triplet regimens.  Doublet regimens include two different chemotherapy agents that are given together.  Examples of doublets include cisplatin and pemetrexed, carboplatin and paclitaxel, and docetaxel and gemcitabine.  Triplet regimens include three different chemotherapy agents that are given together. Examples of triplets include cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab; carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab; and docetaxel, gemcitabine, and cetuximab.  Bevacizumab is a targeted therapy that is added to chemotherapy regimens.  There are also newer targeted therapies for lung cancer that are approved for patients with specific mutations in their lung cancer.  These targeted therapies include erlotinib (Tarceva) for patients with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation and crizotinib (Xalkori) for patients with an ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) mutation.  For patients with early stage lung cancer, surgery is the treatment of choice.  This can be done as a lobectomy or a pneumonectomy, depending on the location of the tumor.  Radiation therapy is also an option for patients who","Yes, there are several new developments in lung cancer treatment that could benefit your friend's wife, Kushum Agarwal, 45, from Raigadh, India, who's about to take her first dose of Almita Pemetrexed on Thursday.

"1. Indications for HBO: Meniere's disease is a clinical diagnosis. The definite diagnosis of Meniere's disease is based on the patients history, clinical findings and audiometry. The following criteria must be satisfied for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease: a. History of episodic vertigo, associated with auditory symptoms, sensation of aural fullness and fluctuating hearing loss. b. Audiometric findings: SNHL of at least 10 dB in 510 Hz and 10 dB in 1000 Hz, with at least 10 dB difference between the two ears. The degree of hearing loss may fluctuate and it is not uncommon to find a marked degree of hearing loss in one test and minimal loss in another. Fluctuating hearing loss is the most characteristic feature of Meniere's disease. c. Caloric tests: Unilateral or bilateral reduced response (by 20-30%) or a reduced and unstable response (by 10-20%) on the involved side. d. Tone decay test: Decay of less than 15 dB in 5 dB steps. 2. Contraindications: Otosclerosis, acoustic neuroma, vestibular schwannoma, active middle or inner ear infection. 3. Treatment modalities: Medical treatment: Antihistaminic, anticholinergics, sedatives, diuretics, vasodilators, serotonin antagonists, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers. Surgical treatment: Intermittent low pressure pulse therapy, endolymphatic sac surgery, surgical destruction of vestibular labyrinth, cochlear implantation, genetic therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen: It is a non-invasive method for treating Meniere's disease. It is a method of treatment which deserves more attention because of its efficiency and low cost. The treatment protocol consists of daily or alternate day sessions of 90 min. each, with the patient breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure of 2.0 MPa (2.5 ATA). The treatment is given in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber","1. The pathophysiology of Meniere's Disease is still not well understood. 2. The most accepted theory is the ""Endolymphatic Hydrops"" which suggests that there is a dilation of the endolymphatic system causing an increase in volume of the endolymphatic fluid in the cochlea. 3. Various factors such as trauma, infection, allergy, autoimmune, hormonal, vascular and viral have been implicated as possible causes of this dilation. 4. The signs and symptoms of Meniere's disease are believed to be caused by increased volume of endolymphatic fluid in the cochlea. 5. The main symptom of Meniere's Disease is an abnormal sensation of hearing, often referred to as ""sea-shell"" or ""roaring"" in the affected ear. 6. It is usually associated with tinnitus, hearing loss and sense of fullness or pressure in the involved ear. 7. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is one of the accepted treatments for Meniere's disease. 8. The exact mechanism of action of HBO in Meniere's disease is still not known. 9. It is postulated that HBO will cause vasoconstriction of the vascular system of the inner ear, thereby reducing the volume of endolymphatic fluid and possibly reversing the symptoms associated with Meniere's disease. 10. HBO therapy is usually administered as a monotherapy, in a treatment chamber where the patient breathes 100% oxygen at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres for periods of 90 minutes each session. 11. The typical treatment protocol is 30 sessions, two sessions per day, three days per week for a total of six weeks. 12. HBO therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling the vertigo associated with Meniere's disease. 13. The evidence, however, for the benefit of HBO therapy in hearing loss and tinnitus associated with Meniere's disease is still limited.",1.

"1. Cochlear implants are used for severe to profound hearing loss where hearing aids do not help. 2. The surgery is performed by a team of surgeons and is usually done on an outpatient basis. 3. The procedure involves placing a tiny electronic device (implant) under the skin behind the ear. 4. The implant is connected to a microphone and speech processor worn outside the ear. 5. The external parts of the device are similar to a hearing aid. 6. After surgery, the child will be taught how to use the device by a trained audiologist.","4-year-old child with bilateral severe hearing loss should definitely be considered for cochlear implant. The earlier the implant is done, the better the results.","1. You should not have any doubts that your child needs a cochlear implant. Research has shown that children who receive cochlear implants at an early age (before 12 months) have better outcomes than children who receive them later in life. 2. Before your child gets an implant, he or she will have a trial with a hearing aid. If the hearing aid doesn't work well for your child, then the doctor may recommend a cochlear implant. 3. Before your child gets an implant, he or she will have to learn how to use a hearing aid. If the hearing aid doesn't work well for your child, then the doctor may recommend a cochlear implant.","1. The cochlear implant is a good option for your child. The implant will not cure your child's hearing loss, but it can help him or her hear better. 2. Before your child gets an implant, he or she will have a trial with the implant's processor. During the trial, your child will be able to hear with the implant for a few weeks. This will give you and your child's teachers a chance to see how well he or she does with the implant. It also gives you a chance to make sure that the implant is working well. 3. Your child will need regular checkups after he or she gets the implant. He or she will probably need to go back to the clinic every few months to have the processor adjusted. 4. Your child will also need speech therapy after the implant is turned on. This will help him or her learn to understand speech with the implant. 5. Your child's teachers and caregivers will need to know how to help your child use the implant. For example, they should speak slowly and clearly to your child. They should also talk to your child's teachers and caregivers about how to help him or her. 6. Your child's hearing loss is likely to get worse over time. However, the cochlear implant can help him or her keep up with others. With the implant, he or she should be able to go to regular schools and hear what is going on.","1. Before getting a cochlear implant, your child will need a thorough exam by an ear specialist. This will include a hearing test (audiogram) to find out how much sound your child can hear. 2. More tests will be done to make sure that your child is a good candidate for this device. These tests will look for problems with the ear canal and the middle ear. They may include a CT scan of the ear. 3. If your child has trouble understanding speech, a speech language pathologist will work with your child to improve those skills. This training will continue after your child gets the implant. 4. Your child will also work with an audiologist, who will help choose the implant and teach your child how to use it. 5. The doctor will answer your questions about the surgery and what to expect afterward.","1. A cochlear implant is an electronic device that is surgically placed under the skin behind the ear. It receives sound from a microphone, which picks up sound from the environment, and converts it to a digital code. The code is then sent to a speech processor, which is worn on the ear like a hearing aid. The speech processor changes the code to a pattern of electrical impulses, which is sent to the transmitting coil. The transmitting coil sends the impulses through the skin to the implanted electrode array. The array sends the impulses to different parts of the cochlea, which then sends the impulses to the brain, where they are converted back to sound. 2. The cochlear implant allows the child to hear and understand speech. The implant does not restore normal hearing, but improves the hearing and understanding of speech. 3. The child should be able to hear speech and understand it well enough to use it for communication without needing to lip-read."
"1. Stem cells are special cells in the body that can divide (copy themselves) and develop into many different types of cells. Stem cells have the ability to renew themselves through mitosis (cell division) and can differentiate into specialized cells types (for example, muscle, bone, etc.). As we age, our stem cells become less pluripotent, and lose their regenerative abilities. 2. Adult stem cells can be found in the bone marrow and other organs and tissues. They can be used for cell-based therapies without the need for embryonic stem cell collection. Adult stem cells have already been used in many clinical trials for a variety of conditions. 3. Stem cells are used in research and clinical trials for a variety of conditions including: leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and aplastic anemia. Stem cell therapies are also being studied for treatment of heart disease, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, macular degeneration, diabetes, arthritis, and other degenerative diseases.","1. Strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) can be corrected with surgery, but often the surgery must be repeated. A new technique that uses stem cells to retrain the brain to coordinate eye movement could lead to a single surgery cure. 2. The technique, developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, uses a tiny computer chip to electrically stimulate the brain. The chip is implanted in the brain and connected to a computer that sends signals to the chip. 3. The computer programs the brain to recognize when the eyes are misaligned and to coordinate their movement. The technique was developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and tested on monkeys. It is currently being tested on humans as part of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial. 4. The implantable chip is expected to be used in people who have had strabismus surgery but still have misaligned eyes. The chip would be implanted in the brain during a 2-hour operation. The chip would send signals to the computer, which would send signals to the brain. The signals would reprogram the brain to recognize when the eyes are misaligned and coordinate their movement. 5. The computer would gradually reduce the number of signals sent to the brain until the brain was controlling the eyes on its own. 6. The goal of the therapy is for the brain to learn how to coordinate eye movement so that the eyes will work together to focus on one image. 7. The procedure is expected to be used on people who have had strabismus surgery but still have misaligned eyes. 8. It could also be used on people who have strabismus that has not been corrected by surgery.","1) Latest advancements in lazy eye correction:  Lazy eye, also known as amblyopia, is poor vision in one eye due to the brain preferring information from the other eye.  Lazy eye is usually treated by patching the good eye (occlusion therapy) to stimulate the lazy eye.  However, this treatment is not always effective.  In addition, the treatment must usually be done for several hours each day for several months.  Recently, researchers have been exploring the use of video game systems as an alternative to traditional patching.  Two video game systems that have been studied for this purpose are the Wii system from Nintendo and the 3-D Vision system from NVIDIA.  Both systems allow the user to play video games in 3-D without wearing special glasses.  These systems may be more appealing to children than traditional patching methods.  The Wii has also been studied in the treatment of adult strabismus.  Adults with strabismus who played video games on the Wii for 30 minutes 3 times a week for 8 weeks had improved vision and better depth perception compared to a control group who did not play video games. 2) The role of adult stem cell research in retraining the brain post-surgery:  The brain can be retrained post-surgery using adult stem cells.  Stem cells are cells that can develop into any type of cell in the body, such as muscle, bone, or nerve cells.  Adult stem cells are found in bone marrow and can be extracted from the bone marrow using a procedure called a bone marrow aspiration.  These adult stem cells can be used to create specialized cells that are used to retrain the brain.  For example, a study published in 2010 used adult stem cells to create neural cells, which were then used to retrain the brain in rats with spinal cord injuries.  These neural cells were injected into the rats' spinal cords, where they developed into neural cells and reconnected with other neural cells in the spinal cord.  This reconnection allowed the rats to regain some movement in their legs.  This procedure has not yet been tested in humans, but it shows promise for the future.","1. What is strabismus? Strabismus is a condition where the eyes are not properly aligned. One or both eyes turn in, out, up, or down. People with strabismus may cross their eyes or squint. This occurs because the brain is sending mixed signals to the eyes. The signals tell the eyes which direction to move. 2. Who is affected by strabismus? Strabismus affects about 2 to 4 out of every 100 children. It can occur in any age group, but is most common in young children. More boys than girls have strabismus. 3. What causes strabismus? Usually, the cause of strabismus is not known. Strabismus can be caused by: - A muscle defect in the eye that causes weakness in the eye muscles - A condition called neurofibromatosis type II, which runs in families - Eye injury - Eye surgery - Other eye problems, such as cataracts, diseases of the retina, or eye tumors 4. How is strabismus treated? Most children with strabismus are treated with glasses, vision therapy, and/or eye muscle surgery. Glasses correct any refractive error (a problem in how the eye focuses) and help the child see more clearly. Vision therapy is a series of eye exercises that help the eyes work together better. For some children, vision therapy can be used instead of surgery. 5. What are the risks of strabismus surgery? The risk of complications from eye muscle surgery is very low. Some possible complications include: - Infection - Bleeding - Double vision - Slight weakness of the operated eye - A change in the shape of the eye - Faulty healing of the eye muscle - Slight over- or under-correction of the eye alignment 6. What is the adult stem cell research therapy that enables full brain retraining after surgery? The therapy is called ""Adult Stem Cell Therapy"" and the research is being conducted by a company called Neuralstem, Inc. The term ""therapy"" is used because the procedure is designed to treat disease, in this case, the eye condition known as strabismus (or amblyopia). The procedure involves injecting neural stem cells into the eye and then","1. Amblyopia is a vision condition in which a person has poorer vision in one eye than the other. This condition is also sometimes called ""lazy eye."" 2. The brain learns to favor one eye over the other, usually the eye with better vision. This is called suppression. 3. The eye with amblyopia cannot be forced to see better by simply patching the eye or using eyeglasses or contact lenses. The brain is already ignoring the signals from this eye. 4. Amblyopia cannot be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. 5. The most common treatment for amblyopia is patching of the eye with normal vision. The eye with amblyopia is patched for a few hours each day. This forces the brain to use the eye with normal vision. 6. The patch must be placed on the eye with normal vision. 7. Patching of the normal eye will not make the amblyopic eye worse. 8. Occlusion therapy is a common treatment for amblyopia. 9. If the problem is not treated in childhood, it is unlikely that the vision could be improved later in life. 10. Some adults have had stem cell therapy to restore the amblyopic eye to normal vision.","1. Surgery: The most common treatment of strabismus is surgery. In surgery, the muscles are either tightened or loosened to help realign the eyes. The surgeon decides which muscles to operate on by examining the patient's eye movements and the results of the imaging tests. 2. Vision Therapy: Vision therapy is a series of exercises designed to change the way the eyes work together. With vision therapy, the eyes learn to work together and see more efficiently. This can help improve eye alignment and reduce eye strain. 3. Eye Muscle Patching: Patching one eye can force the brain to use the patched eye more often. This can strengthen the connection between the eye and the brain. This can help reduce the number of eye turns and crossings. 4. Prism Lenses: Prism lenses can help improve eye alignment. These lenses are made of glass with a special prescription for the person's eye. The prism lenses change the direction of light entering the eye. This can help reduce the number of eye turns and crossings. 5. Botox Injection: Botox injection can help reduce the number of eye turns and crossings. It can be used for people who have strabismus or for people who have had eye muscle surgery."

You need to undergo complete eye examination including visual field charting, color vision test, retinoscopy and other relevant investigations.8. The treatment will depend upon the cause.","1. Yes, it is possible to improve your binocular vision with surgery. 2. The surgery is done in two steps. First, you will have surgery on your eye that has the worse vision. This surgery will make the eye turn in. You will then have surgery on the eye that has better vision. This surgery will make the eye turn out. 3. The goal of the surgery is to make the eyes work together. This will result in better vision.","1. It is possible that you have a problem with your binocular vision, but more information is needed to make a diagnosis and to determine if you have a surgical problem. 2. The most common cause of binocular vision problems in young people is an imbalance in the eyes' refractive error (i.e., nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism). 3. The refractive error imbalance can be corrected by having a comprehensive eye exam by an eye doctor. 4. There are other causes of binocular vision problems such as eye muscle problems, but these are rare and would be diagnosed by an eye exam. 5. If you have a problem with your binocular vision, you should consult with an eye doctor who will be able to evaluate your eye movements and prescribe appropriate glasses or other treatment.","1. Yes, it is possible to correct your eye position and movement problem with surgery. 2. The operation you are most likely referring to is a resection of the medial rectus muscle, also known as a recession. This operation is performed to correct for a form of strabismus called incomitant strabismus, which is a misalignment of the eyes that varies with the direction of gaze. 3. The operation should improve your binocular vision, but the amount of improvement cannot be predicted ahead of time. It depends on a number of factors, including the magnitude of the surgery performed, the degree of pre-existing binocular vision, and how motivated you are postoperatively to work on improving your binocular vision. 4. In order to determine what operation might be appropriate for you, you should be examined by a strabismus surgeon who can determine what type of recession would be appropriate for you.","1. You need to see an ophthalmologist who will examine your eyes and make sure that your eyes are healthy. 2.

It is possible that your daughter's case is particularly severe, but it is not common for this condition to be diagnosed in girls her age.","12-year-old girls with endometriosis are very rare, and it is very unusual to see it at this age. Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue lining the uterus (endometrium) is found outside the uterus - in the pelvis and abdomen. Endometriosis in young girls can cause problems with the ovaries and the tube that carries the egg from the ovary to the uterus. This can affect a girl's ability to have children later in life.  Endometriosis in young girls can also cause pain and other symptoms, such as very heavy periods, pain with defecation (passing a bowel movement), painful micturition (urination), pain in the lower abdomen, and pain with sexual intercourse. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made only by surgery.  The treatment of endometriosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the location and extent of the endometriosis. In some cases, the symptoms may be mild and the endometriosis may be minimal. In these cases, the girl may be treated with hormones, such as birth control pills, which can help to relieve the symptoms. In other cases, the endometriosis may be severe, and the girl may need surgery to remove the diseased tissue.  Girls who have endometriosis should be followed by a gynecologist who has experience in treating young girls. The following organizations may be able to provide additional information:","1. Your daughter should be treated with hormones to stop the growth of the endometriosis. 2. The doctor will most likely give her birth control pills to help control the pain. 3. If the doctor thinks the endometriosis is severe, she may prescribe a stronger medicine that works like a birth control pill but is stronger than the regular birth control pill. 4. Your daughter may also need pain medicine for the cramps. 5. Surgery to remove the endometriosis can be done, but it is not usually recommended for someone her age unless the pain is severe and does not respond to other treatments. 6.

This generic type of device includes the breathing exercise device for use in a pulmonary rehabilitation program that does not incorporate a mechanism to vary resistance to simulate breathing at high altitudes.,"1. The breathing device used during exercise may help reduce exercise-induced asthma symptoms. 2. Exercise-induced asthma is a common problem. Exercising in cold weather or at high elevations can trigger an asthma attack. Exercise-induced asthma can usually be controlled by taking a short-acting bronchodilator (such as Ventolin) 10 to 15 minutes before exercising. 3. A small study suggests that people with exercise-induced asthma may have less trouble if they use a breathing device during exercise. 4. Other options for people who have trouble with exercise-induced asthma include taking a 2-week course of a steroid medication (such as prednisone) before starting an exercise program. 5. If your symptoms are not relieved by these treatments, you may need stronger medications, such as a methylxanthine (such as Theophylline) or a leukotriene modifier (such as Montelukast).","1. Exercise-induced bronchospasm is a common problem in asthmatic patients. 2. The most effective way to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm is to avoid vigorous exercise. 3. If exercise is unavoidable, bronchodilator therapy 10 to 20 minutes before exercise is usually effective. 4. Patients should also be cautioned against excessive inspiration of cold, dry air during exercise. 5. Inhalation of steam or use of a humidifier before exercise may also help prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.","1. Yes, exercise-induced asthma is a type of asthma that can be managed with a short-acting bronchodilator, such as Ventolin. Ventolin is a short-acting bronchodilator that can relieve mild to moderate symptoms of asthma. It works by relaxing the muscles of the airways, which helps you breathe more easily. 2. Another option is a combination inhaler, such as Advair, which contains a long-acting bronchodilator, fluticasone, and a steroid. This type of inhaler is usually used twice daily to help prevent asthma symptoms and is a good option for those with exercise-induced asthma. 3. You may also want to consider using a peak flow meter to help you monitor your lung function. It measures how fast you can exhale and inhale and can help you determine how well your asthma is under control."

The male reproductive system consists of the male gonads (testes), male accessory organs (epididymis, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, prostate, and bulbourethral glands), and the penis. 2. Testes. The testes are the male gonads. Each testis is surrounded by the tunica vaginalis, which consists of layers of mesothelium and is divided into two major compaments by a septum. The compament above the septum is called the tunica vaginalis testis, and the compament below the septum is called the tunica albuginea testis. The tunica vaginalis testis surrounds the parenchyma of the testis, which consists of two major regions: the tubules and the interstitial tissue. The tubules of the testis are composed of the seminiferous tubules and the straight tubules. Seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules contain sperm-producing cells, called germ cells or spermatogonia, and Sertoli cells, which support and nourish the developing sperm cells. Straight tubules. The straight tubules are continuous with the seminiferous tubules and are the sites of sperm transpo and maturation. 3. Male accessory organs. The male accessory organs produce secretions that are discharged with the sperm during ejaculation. These organs include the epididymis, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, prostate, and bulbourethral glands. The epididymis is a firm, nodular structure that lies posterior to the testis. It is composed of a highly coiled tube that acts as a reservoir for mature sperm. The seminal vesicles are two lobulated structures that lie inferior to the ampullae of the ductus deferens and lateral to the bladder. Each vesicle is composed of numerous tubules that terminate in a single excretory duct, which joins the ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct. The prostate gland lies just inferior to the bladder and surrounds the urethra. It consists of fibromus","1.

The male reproductive system is made up of the male genitals and other organs that produce and transport sperm and male sex hormones. 2. The male genitals include the penis, testicles (or testes), and other structures such as the prostate, seminal vesicles, and the bulbourethral glands. 3. The penis is a cylindrical organ that contains spongy tissue and channels for urine and semen. It is covered by a layer of skin. The tip of the penis is called the glans. 4. The testicles are located in a pouch of skin behind the penis. The testicles produce and store sperm and male sex hormones. 5. The seminal vesicles (or vesiculae seminales) are two small glands located near the bladder that produce most of the fluid that makes up semen. 6. The prostate gland is located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It produces fluid that makes up part of the seminal fluid. 7. The bulbourethral glands (or Cowper's glands) are located in the pelvis near the base of the penis. They produce fluid that makes up part of the seminal fluid. 8. The male reproductive system produces and transports sperm and male sex hormones. 9. Sperm are produced in the testes and then stored in the epididymis until they are released through the penis during ejaculation. 10. The male sex hormone testosterone is produced by the testes and is also found in the circulating blood. Testosterone controls the development of the male reproductive organs and the secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of body hair and the development of the musculature. It also has some effect on the metabolic rate and the production of red blood cells.","1.

A high-protein diet can also help to build muscle, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories. 2. Low-carb diet. A low-carb diet, paicularly one that is high in protein, can also be effective for weight loss because it reduces the amount of glucose that is produced during the digestion of food. This means that your body will burn more fat, rather than converting it to glucose and storing it. 3. Low-fat diet. A low-fat diet can also be effective for weight loss because it can force your body to burn more fat, rather than drawing on its glucose reserves. Eating too much fat can lead to the storage of excess fat in your body. A low-fat diet can help you to avoid this. 4. Low-calorie diet. A low-calorie diet is essential for weight loss.

The goal of any weight-loss diet is to create a calorie deficit so that the body burns fat stores and not the lean muscle tissue. A diet that contains plenty of protein helps to prevent the body from breaking down its own lean muscle tissue. Foods rich in protein include low-fat dairy products, lean meats, fish, and beans. 2. To create a calorie deficit, an individual needs to eat fewer calories than he or she burns. To determine the right number of calories for a weight-loss diet, take the person's current body weight and reduce it by 500 calories. For example, a 200-pound man would need to cut 500 calories from his diet each day. 3. A weight-loss diet should also include healthy carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods provide essential nutrients and fiber, which can help to create a feeling of fullness and satisfaction. 4. Foods high in fat should be limited because they are often high in calories. For example, fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products should be avoided. Instead, choose lean meats and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. 5. Water is the best beverage for a weight-loss diet.

"1. Crossed eye (strabismus) is an eye alignment disorder in which the eyes are not properly aligned. 2. Crossed eye occurs when the eyes are not properly aligned because the muscles that control eye movement are not working correctly. 3. The brain then sends a message to the eye muscles to move the eye in the correct direction, but the eye muscle does not move the eye properly because it is not working correctly. 4. This causes one eye to look straight while the other eye looks in a different direction. 5. Crossed eye is most often found in infants and young children. It is usually not a problem in adults because the brain begins to ignore the image from one eye. 6. In children, crossed eye can cause problems because the brain is still learning to see. 7. Crossed eye can also cause problems with depth perception and can affect a child's ability to see in three dimensions. 8. There are several types of crossed eye. The most common types are esotropia (the eye turns inward), exotropia (the eye turns outward), and hyperopia (the eye is too far away from the nose). 9. Crossed eye may be caused by cranial nerve problems, eye muscle problems, eye injury, or eye tumors. 10. Treatment depends on the cause and the type of crossed eye. Glasses, contacts, or surgery may be used.","1) Corrective lenses can help with eye alignment and vision; 2) Vision therapy may also help correct the problem; 3) Corrective surgery is another option, including eye muscle surgery, scleral buckling, and/or lenss; 4) Orthoptic exercises (eye exercises) may be used to treat exotropia.","1.

Exercises that target major muscle groups such as weight training, walking, and swimming. 3. Exercises that improve balance, flexibility, and coordination. 4. Exercises that focus on activities of daily living such as carrying groceries and lifting objects. 5. Exercises that increase the heart rate. 6. Exercises that are moderate to intense and last at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week. 7. Exercises that aim to maintain and not increase the body mass index. 8. Exercises that are individualized and can be modified according to the individual needs and abilities. 9. Exercises that are safe and effective. 10. Exercises that are supervised by a trained professional.","1. Sarcopenia is a condition that is characterized by the loss of muscle mass, function, and strength with aging. 2. Progressive resistance training (PRT) is the most effective intervention for combating sarcopenia. 3. The PRT program should include 8-10 exercises for the major muscle groups and should be performed 3 times per week with progression in load and speed. 4. The exercises should include both single-joint and multijoint exercises. 5. Exercises should include free weights, machines, body weight exercises, and isometric exercises. 6. Exercises should be performed with higher speeds and lower resistance for shorter periods of time (e.g., 4 sets of 8-10 repetitions with 1-2 min of rest between sets).","1. Sarcopenia is a condition characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass and function with aging. 2. The recommended exercise routine to counteract sarcopenia is a combination of aerobic, resistance, and balance exercises. 3. The ideal timing for these activities is to perform resistance exercise first, followed by aerobic and balance exercises. 4. Performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise may increase the resting metabolic rate and improve lipid profiles. 5. Balance exercise should be performed last as it helps to maintain the functional ability and reduce the risk of falls. 6. The resistance exercise program should include 8-10 different exercises for 8-10 different muscle groups with 8-12 repetitions for each exercise and 2-3 sets. 7. The aerobic exercise program should include 40-60 minutes of exercise performed 3-5 times per week. 8. The balance exercise program should include exercises that target the proprioceptors, such as toe-standing, single-leg stance, and tandem stance.","1. It is common for strength to decrease with age, but not all older adults experience the same rate of decline. Older adults who maintain or increase their strength have better physical functioning and are less likely to develop disabilities. Older adults who participate in resistance training are able to walk farther and with better speed and balance.2. Muscle mass and strength decline with age, but the rate of decline varies greatly among individuals.3. Resistance training is the most effective way to maintain muscle mass and strength.4. Resistance training should target major muscle groups, including the leg muscles, abdominal muscles, and arm muscles.5. Resistance training should be done to the point of fatigue. This means that the last set of an exercise should be the one that is just barely possible to complete.6. Resistance training should be done at least 2 days per week.7. Resistance training can be done using free weights, exercise machines, or resistance bands.8. Resistance training should be done with moderate to high intensity (60-80% of maximum effort).9. Older adults should increase their protein intake to 1 gram of protein for every pound of weight that they lift.10. Older adults should also increase their fluid intake to 16 ounces of water per pound of weight lifted.11. Older adults should allow 48 hours between resistance training sessions for muscle recovery.12. Older adults should work out for 30 minutes to 1 hour at a time.","1) Resistance training is recommended for older adults to counter sarcopenia and minimize strength loss and fatigue. 2) Muscle weakness and fatigue are common consequences of aging that can be reduced with regular physical activity. 3) Resistance training should target all major muscle groups, including the upper body, lower body, and core. 4) To optimize the benefits of resistance training and minimize injury risk, older adults should start with 2 or 3 days per week of resistance training and gradually increase the frequency to 5 days per week as tolerated. 5) Incorporating higher intensity exercise, such as interval training, may be an effective strategy to minimize the effects of muscle aging.","1. Strength training exercises: Strength training exercises are recommended for older adults to help maintain and improve muscle strength, reduce the risk of falling, and maintain independence. There are several guidelines for strength training for older adults. One recommendation is to perform 8-10 repetitions of 8-10 exercises for 2 or 3 days per week. Exercises should include exercises for the major muscle groups: legs, hips, shoulders, chest, upper back, and arms. Exercises should also include exercises for flexibility.2. Endurance training: Endurance training exercises are recommended to improve cardiorespiratory endurance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Older adults should perform 10-15 repetitions of 10-15 exercises for 3-5 days per week. Exercises should include a variety of activities such as walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling.3. Balance training: Balance training exercises are recommended to improve balance and reduce the risk of falling. Older adults should perform 10-15 repetitions of 10-15 exercises for 2-3 days per week. Exercises should include a variety of activities such as tai chi, yoga, and exercises that require balance.4. Flexibility training: Flexibility training exercises are recommended to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury. Older adults should perform 10-15 repetitions of 10-15 exercises for 2-3 days per week. Exercises should include a variety of activities such as stretching and yoga.5.

"1.1.1. Treatment of Hyperkalemia: The treatment of hyperkalemia should be approached in a stepwise manner. Initially, antagonism of the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia can be attempted with the administration of calcium gluconate. Calcium raises the action potential threshold and reduces the excitability of cardiac myocytes in the presence of hyperkalemia. The effect is relatively rapid, but generally dissipates within minutes. The effect can be sustained by the administration of a calcium-chelating agent, such as calcium resonium or calcium-sodium edetate. These agents will rapidly lower serum calcium levels, thus diminishing the effects of the calcium gluconate. 1.1.2. Potassium Removal: The removal of potassium can be accomplished by the use of potassium-removing agents. The two most commonly used agents are sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and loop diuretics. SPS exchanges Na+ for K+ in the gastrointestinal tract and increases the fecal excretion of K+. Loop diuretics induce the secretion of K+ into the urine by augmenting the flow of salt across the renal tubule. 1.1.3. Potassium Replacement: After the acute hyperkalemic crisis has been resolved, the patient may require potassium replacement. Generally, potassium can be administered when the serum potassium level is below 3.0 meq/L. When it is above 3.0 meq/L, dextrose-containing intravenous fluids should be administered to lower the serum potassium level. Potassium replacement can be accomplished by the administration of potassium chloride, potassium bicarbonate, or potassium phosphate. 1.1.4. Potassium-Sparing Agents: Patients with a significant defect in renal potassium excretion may require the use of a potassium-sparing diuretic. The two potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride and triamterene. These agents are generally used in conjunction with other di",1) Treatment of the underlying condition. 2) Treatment of symptoms. 3) Treatment of complications.,"1) Conservative treatment is the first choice, including physical therapy, medications for pain, anti-inflammatory drugs, and lifestyle changes. 2) If conservative treatment fails, surgical treatment is the next step.","1.

The symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are quite different. EDS is a connective tissue disorder that causes joints to be loose and flexible, which can lead to frequent joint dislocations. Patients with EDS also have very stretchy skin and may have scars that are much more easily visible than those of the average person. 2. OI is a genetic disorder that affects the development of bones. People with OI have bones that are very fragile and break easily. They may also have other skeletal problems, such as curved bones, which can cause deformities. People with OI usually have white spots in their skin and may have blue sclerae (the whites of their eyes are blue). 3. A genetic test for either EDS or OI would be performed on a small amount of blood, saliva, or other fluid from the body. These tests are not always covered by insurance, and the cost can be high. You should speak with your doctor about your options for testing.","1. The symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) share many similarities. Both EDS and OI are caused by defects in genes that code for proteins that make up connective tissues. 2. The symptoms of EDS and OI also vary greatly from person to person. In general, people with EDS have extremely flexible joints and very fragile, elastic skin. People with OI often have frequent fractures and bone deformities. 3. Some people with EDS also have blood vessel abnormalities that can lead to ruptured arteries or internal bleeding. 4.

The opinions of Dutch GPs and specialists regarding the curability of asthma. van den Berg-Emmersmann E, van der Molen T, Nijkamp A, Rabe K. Abstract BACKGROUND: Asthma is an increasing problem in the Netherlands and in other Western countries. Although much is known about the pathophysiology of asthma, the curability of asthma is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To explore Dutch GPs' and specialists' beliefs regarding the curability of asthma. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to 1000 GPs and 500 specialists working in the Dutch health care system, asking for their opinions regarding the curability of asthma and the reasons underlying their opinions. RESULTS: A total of 428 GPs (43%) and 228 specialists (45%) responded. Most GPs (68%) and specialists (81%) thought that asthma was not curable. The most frequently mentioned reason by GPs was that asthma had a complex pathophysiology, whereas specialists mainly mentioned the occurrence of exacerbations as an indication of the uncurability of asthma. Most GPs (69%) and specialists (67%) mentioned no treatment as the most important factor for uncurability. CONCLUSION:Although most GPs and specialists thought that asthma was not curable, no uniform opinion existed regarding the reasons for this uncurability. These beliefs may influence the way GPs and specialists treat their patients with asthma.

Answer: yes","1. Asthma cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. 2. People with asthma often need to use medications, such as inhalers, to control their symptoms. 3. Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief and long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines are used to treat coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. They can also help prevent asthma attacks. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. 4. The goals of asthma treatment are to: prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, maintain good lung function, and reduce your risk of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospital stays.","1. Asthma is not curable, but its symptoms can be controlled with proper treatment. 2. The goal of treatment is to control asthma symptoms and prevent attacks by controlling airway inflammation and preventing exposure to irritants and/or allergens. 3.

Employees with active shingles should be excluded from work involving food preparation until the risk of transmitting the virus is eliminated.6. Infectious shingles can be treated with antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir.7. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered."
"1. Surgical Options. If medications have not helped, surgery may be considered. The surgeon may do a laparoscopy or an open procedure. The goal is to tighten the LES. Some surgeries can be done without cutting the skin (laparoscopic surgeries). Others require open surgery (cutting the skin). These procedures are done if you have ongoing symptoms of GERD and medicines have not helped. Common surgeries include: Fundoplication. This is a wrap of the upper part of the stomach. The wrap is meant to strengthen the LES. Partial wraps are done if you are having symptoms of GERD and no damage to the esophagus. Total wraps are done if you have damage to the esophagus. Fundoplication may be done with a laparoscope or through an open incision. Herniation (hernia) repair. This is done if you have a hiatal hernia. The surgeon moves the part of the stomach that has moved up into the chest back into the abdomen. This is often done with a laparoscope. Myotomy. This is a surgery done for Achalasia. The muscles in the lower part of the esophagus that are not working are cut. This allows food and liquid to pass into the stomach. This is often done with a laparoscope. 2. Other Options. Other options may be tried if surgery does not help. They include: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). EUS uses sound waves to look at the lining of the esophagus and the muscles between the esophagus and the stomach. This can help find abnormalities that may need treatment. Botox injection. A medicine that temporarily paralyzes muscles is injected into the LES. This can help tighten the LES and improve symptoms. But the effect is only temporary. Multiple injections may be needed. Injections are done every 3 to 12 months. 3. Lifestyle Changes. You may need to make changes in your lifestyle: Avoiding foods that cause problems. Eating small meals. Waiting 3 hours after a meal before lying down. Avoiding caffeine, nic","1. Surgery for hiatal hernia is usually only done if medicines don't help enough. It can be done as a regular surgery or with a laparoscope. After surgery, you will probably need to avoid foods and drinks that can make your symptoms worse, such as coffee and alcohol. 2. Your doctor may suggest surgery if you have complications of GERD, such as esophagitis or Barrett esophagus. 3. Surgery to treat hiatal hernia can include: Fundoplication - This is a surgical procedure that involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to help prevent acid reflux. Esophagomyotomy - This surgery is done to correct a condition called achalasia, which causes muscle spasms in the lower part of the esophagus. Partial wraps - This type of surgery is done for people who have a weak lower esophageal sphincter but no other symptoms of GERD. 4. Before your surgery, your doctor will make sure you don't have any infections. You will probably have a physical exam before the surgery to check if you are healthy enough for the surgery. 5. You will probably have blood tests to check for anemia and other problems. You may also need an electrocardiogram to check your heart. 6.

"1) The first line treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is a group of medicines called disease modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs. Methotrexate is the DMARD most commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. 2) The most recent research shows that when methotrexate stops working (if it does at all) it is usually because the patient has taken the medicine correctly and the arthritis has gone away. At this point it is time to consider switching to another DMARD. 3) Leflunomide is the DMARD most commonly used after methotrexate stops working. 4) If methotrexate and leflunomide do not work, the next DMARDs that can be used are sulfasalazine and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. 5) Biological medicines are used if the DMARDs do not work.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare disease that results from the degeneration of nerve cells in parts of the brain and spinal cord that control movement. Symptoms usually appear in childhood and include uncoordinated movements, muscle weakness and stiffness, and problems with speech and swallowing. People with Friedreich ataxia may also have Diabetes mellitus, Optic atrophy, Scoliosis, Cardiomyopathy, and/or other conditions. 2. Friedreich ataxia is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. This protein is necessary for the normal function of nerve cells. Most people with Friedreich ataxia inherit the disease in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that two copies of the FXN gene must be affected for this to develop. 3. The following tests may be used to diagnose Friedreich ataxia: - Complete physical skin exam performed (ML) - ECG (ML) - Echocardiography (ML) - Electrocardiography (ML) - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (ML) - MRI of the head (ML) - Nerve conduction velocity (ML) - X-ray (ML) 4.

"1. Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. 2. Your immune system is your defense against disease. It attacks something that seems foreign, like bacteria or viruses. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This is called autoimmune destruction. No one knows what starts the attack. It may be a virus or a diet high in animal fats and proteins. 3. Another theory is that the immune attack is triggered by a virus or other infection. Researchers are studying this theory. They have found evidence of viruses in the pancreas of people with type 1 diabetes. 4. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults. Only 5 to 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes are over age 30. It is most common in people who have family members with type 1 diabetes. It is less common in people who have family members with type 2 diabetes. 5. Type 1 diabetes is less common in African Americans than in whites.","Two major types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or early adulthood. With type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops in middle-aged and older adults. With type 2 diabetes, the more common form of diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use it properly. With both types of diabetes, glucose levels in the blood become very high and this causes damage to the blood vessels and nerves. High blood glucose levels can also cause loss of weight and tiredness.  The cause of diabetes depends on the type of diabetes. With type 1 diabetes, researchers think that the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The exact cause of this attack is not known. With type 2 diabetes, although the exact cause is also not known, researchers think that obesity and lack of exercise may play a part. Obesity may cause the body to become resistant to insulin, so that more insulin is needed. Lack of exercise may cause the muscle and liver cells to become resistant to insulin.  Other risk factors for type 2 diabetes include having a family history of diabetes, having been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and having impaired glucose metabolism. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and goes away after delivery. Impaired glucose metabolism is a condition in which blood glucose levels are between normal and diabetic levels. People with impaired glucose metabolism are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.","3 main factors are autoimmunity, genetic susceptibility, and beta cell dysfunction.","Diabetes is a chronic disease that results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.  The major susceptibility gene for type 1 diabetes is located in the HLA region on chromosome 6. The most strongly associated alleles are the HLA DR3 and/or DR4 haplotypes. However, most individuals with these haplotypes do not develop diabetes. Additional genetic loci that may contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes include the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the insulin gene, and the polymorphisms for the IL-10 and IL-1 receptors.  Many environmental factors have also been implicated as risk factors for the development of type 1 diabetes, including viral infections, nutritional factors, and toxins.  Several viruses including rubella, mumps, coxsackie, influenza, and paramyxovirus have been implicated as potential triggers for the development of type 1 diabetes.  Nutritional factors including breastfeeding and the intake of cows' milk have also been implicated as potential triggers.  In addition, several toxins including nitrosamines, 2-methoxyethyl alcohol, and various forms of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also been implicated as potential triggers.  The exact mechanism by which any of these factors might trigger the development of type 1 diabetes is unknown.",30% of cases are caused by an autoimmune process in which the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.,"1. Juvenile Diabetes, also known as Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM), is a chronic disease that occurs when your body can't effectively use the sugar (glucose) you get from food. 2. Glucose is your bodies main source of energy, and insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. 3. With type 1 diabetes, your body still makes insulin, but doesn't use it well, and you don't make enough of it. 4. The cause of this is unknown, but scientists think it might be an autoimmune disorder - your body's immune system attacks the cells that make insulin. 5. Another theory is that a virus triggers your immune system to attack the cells that make insulin. 6. The risk of getting type 1 diabetes is higher if you have a family member with it. 7. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually appear quickly. They include: - increased thirst - increased urination - increased hunger - unexplained weight loss - fatigue - blurry vision - slow healing - skin infections"

"1. No exercises can correct a hernia.2. Hernias are common in people who have very weak muscles around the abdomen. In such cases, the muscles cannot hold the internal organs in place. As a result, the organs bulge through the muscles and into the groin area.3. The best way to treat a hernia is with surgery. Surgery is necessary to repair the defect in the muscle and to return the protruding organ to its proper place inside the abdomen.4. The surgery is usually done under local anesthesia, and you can go home the same day. You can return to work the next day, and you'll be back to your normal activities in just a few days.","1.

"Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It generally happens when the fluid pressure inside your eyes slowly rises, damaging your optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.  A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. This exam includes testing your visual acuity (vision sharpness), checking your pupils, and measuring the pressure in your eyes.  Treatment for glaucoma is tailored to each patient. It may include prescription eyedrops, glaucoma surgery, or other eye medicines. The goal of treatment is to reduce pressure in the eye to prevent damage to the optic nerve. NIH: National Eye Institute","1. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. 2. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 3. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma. It is chronic and slowly progressive. 4. Vision loss usually occurs gradually and painlessly. 5. The angle between the iris and cornea is where fluid leaves the eye. When the angle is blocked, fluid can't leave the eye. This causes the pressure inside the eye to increase. 6. Elevated pressure inside the eye can damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss. 7. Open-angle glaucoma is treated with eyedrops, pills, or laser surgery. 8. To keep eye pressure at a normal level, you may need to use eyedrops every day for the rest of your life. 9. Other types of glaucoma are acute (angle-closure) glaucoma and secondary glaucoma.","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that cause damage to the optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. 2. Open-angle glaucoma is a chronic disease that often develops over many years. It is caused by increased pressure inside the eye. This increased pressure may be due to the fluid in the eye not being able to drain properly. 3. Some people with open-angle glaucoma do not develop any noticeable vision problems. However, if the condition is left untreated long enough, vision loss can occur. 4. There are several different types of glaucoma. One type is acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is a different kind of glaucoma than open-angle glaucoma. It is more common in people who are farsighted and occurs less often. 5. Other types of glaucoma include secondary glaucoma and congenital glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma is caused by some other eye problem, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or tumors. Congenital glaucoma is a rare type of glaucoma. It is present at birth.","1. Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. 2. Some types of glaucoma are:  - Chronic glaucoma, which is the most common type.  - Acute angle-closure glaucoma, which occurs in about 10 percent of people with glaucoma.  - Secondary glaucoma, which can be caused by other eye diseases, such as cataract, or by injuries. 3. Risk Factors for Glaucoma  - Age. The risk of chronic glaucoma increases after age 40.  - Family history. People with a family history of glaucoma are at higher risk.  - Race. African Americans have a higher risk of glaucoma than other races.  - Glaucoma tends to run in families.  - High eye pressure. The higher the eye pressure, the greater the risk.  - Older age. The risk increases with age.  - Diabetes. Diabetes may increase the risk of glaucoma.  - A history of eye injuries.  - Certain medicines. These include corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), a drug called beta blockers, and some anti-glaucoma medicines.  - Other medical problems. These include heart disease, high blood pressure, and chronic diarrhea.  - Nearsightedness (myopia).  - Frequent changes in the shape or size of the eye (axial myopia).  - Eye trauma.  - Cataracts.  4. The Eye of the Glaucoma: The optic nerve is the structure at the back of the eye that carries visual information to the brain. In glaucoma, the optic nerve is gradually damaged. 5. Symptoms  - Early glaucoma has no symptoms. That's why glaucoma is such a dangerous disease—the vision loss is painless and gradual, so many people don't know they have it until the disease has caused significant vision loss.   - As the disease progresses, there may be:  - Vision loss.  - Hazy","1.

Part of the large intestine can also be removed without significant adverse health effects. However, removal of significant portions of the intestines can lead to malabsorption of nutrients and electrolytes and can lead to significant adverse health effects.","1. Yes, it is possible for a person to experience intestinal damage severe enough to require the removal of 70-80% of their small intestine and part of their large intestine after eating dinner one day and being rushed to the hospital the next.2. This type of intestinal damage is typically the result of a very severe abdominal injury, often caused by a car accident, a fall from a great height, or a gunshot wound.3. The removal of such a large section of the intestines is a very serious surgical procedure that can lead to life-long digestive problems.4.

In the case of this patient, the cause was appendicitis. The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch that is located at the junction between the large and small intestines. Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes inflamed, usually due to infection. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young adults. When the appendix becomes inflamed, it can swell and become increasingly painful. If left untreated, the appendix can burst, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity and causing a severe infection. This can result in sepsis, which can lead to a very low blood pressure, multiple organ failure, and ultimately, death.  The appendix can be removed by a laparoscopic (minimally invasive) or open surgical procedure. In this case, the open surgical approach was used because the appendix had burst, and there was concern that it might have perforated the bowel.

In summary, this patient's appendix burst, and he needed an emergency surgery to remove a large portion of his intestine, including 70-80% of his small intestine, just two days later.","1) Yes, it is possible for a person to go from eating dinner on Saturday to having a life-threatening intestinal issue requiring the removal of 70-80% of their small intestine and part of their large intestine by Tuesday. 2) The most common cause of this type of intestinal issue is an acute intestinal obstruction. 3) An intestinal obstruction occurs when there is a blockage in the intestine that prevents food from moving forward. 4) This blockage can occur due to a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, a twisted or scarred intestine, an intestinal hernia, or intestinal cancer. 5) In an acute intestinal obstruction, a person will present with abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and constipation. 6) If left untreated, an acute intestinal obstruction can lead to a life-threatening intestinal issue by causing the intestines to become ischemic (lack of blood flow) and/or gangrenous (dead tissue). 7) Treatment for an acute intestinal obstruction involves surgical removal of the blockage, if possible, and repair of any underlying issues. 8) If the blockage cannot be removed or if the intestines become gangrenous, then removal of the affected intestine may be necessary."

Also, if you do have a disease, it does not necessarily mean that the mutation is the cause of the disease since many genes can contribute to the same disease.  Therefore, the results of these tests need to be interpreted by a geneticist.",Genetic testing can be used to diagnose genetic conditions even if you do not have symptoms.  It can also identify if you have a genetic change that may put you at risk for developing a certain disease in the future.,"Yes, you can undergo genetic testing even if you don't know what illness the mutation might cause. Sometimes genetic testing can reveal information about a person's risk for developing a disease in the future.","1.

You should discuss this with your healthcare provider. 3. If a mutation is found, it may take time to figure out what it means and whether it is associated with a condition. You should discuss this with your healthcare provider or a genetic counselor.","Yes, genetic testing can be used to diagnose inherited conditions even when the symptoms or signs of the disorder have not yet appeared.  For example, genetic testing can confirm whether or not an individual has inherited a mutated gene for a disorder that may have affected his or her parents, grandparents, or other close relatives.  In such cases, the individual is said to be a ""carrier"" of the genetic mutation. Being a carrier does not necessarily mean that the person will develop the disorder.

"1. The first thing to try is a simple manoeuvre called huffing, where the patient is encouraged to take a deep breath in, and then forcefully exhale against a closed airway. This can often dislodge the obstruction. 2. If this is unsuccessful, then a fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be required to remove the foreign body. 3. In severe cases where the patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation, then a more emergent removal via laryngoscopy and Magill forceps may be required.","1. The treatment for atelectasis is based on the underlying cause. If atelectasis is caused by a mucus plug, the mucus plug must be removed. This can be done using a flexible tube called a bronchoscope that is passed through the mouth and/or nose to the blocked airway. Often the mucus is loosened by using medicines that break down mucus (mucolytics) and/or nebulized saline. 2. If atelectasis is caused by a foreign object (foreign body), it must be removed. This is done using a bronchoscope. 3. If atelectasis is caused by a tumor, the tumor must be removed. This is done using a bronchoscope. 4. If atelectasis is caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles that control breathing, it must be treated. This is done using a bronchoscope. 5. If atelectasis is caused by a lung abnormality (e.g., cyst, bulla, bleb) that cannot be treated or removed, the atelectasis may be treated by a procedure called lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). LVRS is a way to reduce the size of the damaged lung so that the remaining lung tissue can work better. 6. If atelectasis is caused by a lung infection, it will often clear up with antibiotic treatment. 7. If atelectasis is caused by a lung tumor, it will often shrink with radiation therapy. If it does not shrink, the tumor may be removed using a bronchoscope. 8. If atelectasis is caused by a lung tumor that cannot be treated or removed, it may be treated with radiation therapy.",2 possible answers: a. A ventilator is used to breathe for the patient.

In males, infertility is generally assumed after three months of failed intercourse. Female infertility is more complex, however, and can be caused by a number of factors including hormonal imbalances, blocked fallopian tubes, problems with ovulation, and uterine abnormalities. Women with ovarian failure may experience infertility because of a lack of eggs to become fertilized. Ovarian failure can result from chemotherapy or radiation treatment, autoimmune disease, or genetic abnormalities. Cancer treatment, especially with chemotherapy drugs, can affect fertility in both sexes, often resulting in temporary infertility. Radiation therapy to the pelvis may also damage ovarian and testicular function.  Research suggests that women who have their ovaries removed before the age of 40 are at high risk for infertility. For those under age 40, the risk of infertility after unilateral oophorectomy is 15 percent, compared to 30 percent for those who have both ovaries removed. In addition, the risk of infertility increases with age at the time of oophorectomy. For example, the risk of infertility is about 20 percent for women who have their ovaries removed before age 30, compared to 40 percent for women who have the procedure performed after age 40.  In addition, women who have had a hysterectomy, which involves the surgical removal of the uterus, are at increased risk for infertility. The risk depends on the woman's age at the time of surgery and the type of hysterectomy performed. For example, the risk of infertility is about 25 percent for women who have a hysterectomy before age 35, compared to about 40 percent for women who have the procedure performed after age 35.

"Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare genetic disorder of the brain that results in impaired brain development. Individuals with MCPH have a small head (microcephaly) and a reduced number of cells in the brain (microencephaly). Infants with MCPH typically have normal growth and weight at birth, but they fail to grow at a normal rate during the first year of life. They may have developmental delays, including delayed motor milestones such as sitting up, crawling, and walking. Children with MCPH have a range of additional features including seizures, muscle weakness, speech delay, hearing and vision problems, and intellectual disability. The features of MCPH vary among affected individuals, depending on the severity of the disorder. Some individuals with MCPH have more severe intellectual disability and require lifelong support.","1. Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare genetic condition that affects the brain and results in significant growth delays of the head and brain. 2. MCPH is caused by mutations in the MCPH1, WDR62, CDKN1B, CENPJ, and CEP152 genes. 3. People with MCPH have severely reduced head growth in the womb and as newborns. They also have a small head (microcephaly) and developmental delay. 4. Children with MCPH develop normally for the first few years of life. Then their development slows and they develop problems with movement and communication. 5. There is no cure for MCPH, and treatment is focused on the symptoms. 6. People with MCPH typically have a normal lifespan.",No,"1. Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly: This is a rare primary microcephaly syndrome with characteristics of severe MR (IQ usually less than 40), epilepsy, and characteristic facial features (including a long, narrow head, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and a small chin). The disease is caused by mutations in the MCPH1, WDR62, or PHC1 genes. 2. Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly: This is another rare primary microcephaly syndrome with characteristics of severe MR (IQ usually less than 40), epilepsy, and characteristic facial features (including a long, narrow head, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and a small chin). The disease is caused by mutations in the PHC1 or PHC2 genes.",My answer is that you should ask your doctor to refer you to a geneticist or a genetic counselor.  They will be able to tell you more about this condition and if it is autosomal recessive.  They will also be able to tell you if there are any tests that you should have to see if other members of your family have this condition.,"1. The first description of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) was in 1960 by G. E. Bergsma and A. M. Dempsey. 2. It was first described in a Brazilian family by Harding and colleagues in 1991. 3. The term MCPH has been used to describe patients with normal brain weight and head circumference at birth who develop microcephaly in the first 2 years of life. 4. Patients present with mild intellectual disability and characteristic facial features such as a long, narrow head, hypertelorism, and a small jaw. 5. Seizures and abnormalities of vision, hearing, or the cardiac or skeletal systems are common. 6. The disease has been mapped to chromosome 19q13 in 1998 and subsequently to mutations in the MCPH1 gene. 7. Mutations in the MCPH1 gene have also been found in patients with lissencephaly type 2."
"1. Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical neuromuscular assessment is advised. As mentioned by you that the pain is in between the hip and the knee, I suspect it to be a pinched nerve pain. As the nerve gets pinched in its course. Maybe an MRI will be needed to understand the soft tissue pathology. Also, by performing some special clinical test we can come close to the diagnosis and with the help of MRI the soft tissue status will be understood.2. Also, undergoing physical therapy like - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help reduce the pain. Exercise will be guided to strengthen the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor, lower limbs etc. As the muscles of the posterior area get stronger the pain can be avoided.3. Usually, in my clinical practice I see cases with similar complains. And a thorough neuromuscular assessment is performed. Post which physical therapy is advised and 99% of cases recover. I will recommend you the same to undergo a thorough neuromuscular assessment by an orthopedic and then a physical therapist will be of help. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In PMC-LLaMA.","1. Your symptoms suggest you have varicose veins. 2.

Your pain is due to Arthritis. When bone is not able to take weight due to arthritis than it has to be shared by muscles. It causes pain in thigh and calf muscles. 2. You can judge your pain is due to Arthritis or sciatica by doing the following test. Lie down on your back and lift both the legs one by one, if it is painful stop at the point of pain and count from 1 to 100. If it is lower back pain count will be less than 100, if it is sciatica count will be more than 100. 3. I suggest you to do X-ray lower back and hip and consult your doctor. If it is arthritis than you can take painkiller like kilos or biozobid-plus only when your back pain is worse enough or disturbing your routine work. Apart from this you can take tablet pregame forte once a day. Do regular physiotherapy and avoid sitting cross-legged and squatting. Do not lift heavy weights. 4. If it is sciatica then you will need MRI scan of lower back and may need to see a neurologist. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query.
